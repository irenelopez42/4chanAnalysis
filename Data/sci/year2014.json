Cardinality is a fun idea, but it doesn't work here. Probability is, first and foremost, A MEASURE. There are measure zero sets for which the cardinality is the same as of all reals, so you don't have a \"chance\" for the arbitrary number of such set to be randomly picked, and yet such set is \"big\" in terms of cardinality.

In particular A must contain the void and E. Intuitively, A is the family of relevant \"events\" you will consider (for instance the even \"no marble is picked\" correspond to the void, the event \"a blue marble is picked\" correspond to Ab).-a probability measure P, ie a function that to an element of A associates a real number between 0 and 1. For instance we can have P(Ar)=1/2 (\"the probability of picking a red marble is 1/2\"). Beware, P must fulfill some conditions to qualify as a probability, so you can't just set the values arbitrarily.The situation you consider doesn't exist as such, physically. So it's either the astute modelization of some complex phenomenon, or a simple mind games with its own rule (it might even turn out to be both). In both cases, you need rules to play (or modelization hypothesis in the former case). Those are provided with the three elements listed above.

You can consider (as Kant did, I think) that infinity is merely a name for the completion of an abstract rule (for instance for every integer n you know you can add 1 to generate n+1, and that there is no intuitive arbitrary limit for this, thus infinity represent the general ability to increase by one without upper bound).Likewise, some consider it a useful fiction, a trick that allows us to see things from a distance and understand quantities more clearly.Nevermind, it's a very useful trick.

How it works, how things and phenomena we observe and measure are a consequence of other things. It is often said that science only aims at explaining the how, not the why, but then it is often forgotten that wondering and asking about the why can help explain the how. Note that I don't mean 'why' as in purpose but as in physical cause.Unfortunately it seems that nowadays people are no longer working towards this quest. Fundamental theories in physics start from axioms, the logical consequences of which help describe what we observe and allow to predict measurements and observations, but people no longer wonder about or try to find physical mechanisms that could explain why these axioms are true. They have stopped their questioning and their reasoning at these axioms, which we are supposed to accept and be content with. I'll exemplify what I mean with the case of special relativity.One of the axioms of special relativity is that the two-way speed of light is always measured to be the same by any observer in an inertial frame. Einstein does not wonder what physical mechanism could cause any observer to measure the two-way speed of light to be constant, he takes it as a law of nature, and deduce from it the effects of length contraction and time dilation. But what kind of law of nature is this that depends on observers, what if we want to know why all inertial observers measure the two-way speed of light to be the same, what is the physical explanation behind it? In fact the constancy of the measured two-way speed of light can be deduced from the idea that light propagates at velocity c relative to a physical medium, and that observers moving at velocity v relative to this medium are length contracted and time dilated by the factor sqrt(1-v^2/c^2). "}, "replies": [" >>6945594 (cont)One of the reasons Einstein's axiomatic approach was preferred over the physical one is that the constancy of the measured two-way speed of light is one assumption, while the existence of an underlying medium and of length contraction and time dilation occuring during motion relative to that medium are two assumptions (or three if we take length contraction and time dilation as separate ones), but one then should wonder if our quest to understand the universe should limit itself to describing and predicting observations and measurements, rather than actually trying to find the physical causes behind what we observe. That it is possible to arrive at the same experimental predictions using only one assumption, which is a consequence of the other two or three, should not make the one assumption the preferred choice when it does not provide a physical mechanism explaining its truth.The axiomatic approach asks us to stop our questioning and reasoning there, while the physical approach asks us to keep our questioning going further. Why are bodies length contracted and time dilated when in motion relative to the underlying medium in which light propagates? Looking for an answer to this question could lead us to a much, much deeper understanding of the universe. Is everything, light, matter, excitations of this medium? Is there some cyclical process in these excitations that slows down when the excitations are moving relative to the medium, explaining the slow down and time and the origin of time itself? The possible existence of an underlying medium and of everything being excitations of this medium is more than a philosophical question. If it exists, there may be experiments that could be devised to detect it. What is certain is that if we stop asking further questions we will never find further answers, unless we stumble on them by accident when future experimental results turn out to be inconsistent with current theories. ", " >>6945597 (cont)If scientists hadn't postulated the existence of atoms that they could not see to explain observations and measurements, they would not have devised experiments to probe their structure, and then I wonder where we would be today technologically and scientifically wise. In the same way, if 20th century scientists had postulated the existence of an underlying medium that they could not see to explain observations and measurements (the constancy of the measured two-way speed of light), they would have devised experiments to probe its nature, and I wonder where we would be today.Unfortunately it doesn't seem that this state of affairs is about to change anytime soon. The practice of science has become almost a religion, in which we must accept what we are taught as absolute truth. When we are able to regurgitate what we are taught correctly, when we can recite theories, theorems, axioms and formulas, then we are deemed talented, good students, even if we don't know anything about the experiments that led to the theories being devised in the first place, even if we don't understand anything about how the universe works. Then these successful students go on to become scientists or teachers. And in a way that is bound to never self-correct, the scientists are not judged by their peers by their ability to understand but by their adhering to what they were taught, while the teachers keep perpetuating what they were taught as absolute truth. People are no more concerned about understanding things deep down. It's all about having a career and religiously accepting what we are told.I wonder if some of you feel the same about all this ", " >>6945594I feel you OP. Here at university all the students care about are the grades. Only way to achieve that is to memorize all the formulas, but disregard the origin since all that matters is the recitation of the formulas on the test. Critical thinking is absent here, people ingest information thrown at them without the slightest bit of inquiry. ", " It's good if you come up with good question which can be answered.But at the same time you bring forward an non-positivistic picture of the world and for me I don't see the merit - there are enough things to learn for me, even when taking the concise approach.

Yet in the current situation, especially since the advent of relativity and quantum mechanics, I don't think that can happen again. Scientists see these theories as those unshakable things that shall not be touched, they don't even want to think about trying to find physical mechanisms to explain the axioms at their basis, even though it could very well lead us to a much deeper understanding of the universe. We're just supposed to \"shut up and calculate\", that's what modern physics has become. The theories work, so shut up and calculate. Learn those formulas, apply them that way, don't try to find what physical processes could be responsible for making them work.Most scientists today probably don't even know about the experiments that led the theories they are using to be devised in the first place. You can be a successful, recognized scientist, and just know how to apply the theory. It is not about understanding anymore, it is about applying. It isn't about finding causes, it's about describing observations and making accurate predictions. I guess most people don't care about understanding and finding causes, they just want to apply what they learnt by heart, have a successful career, make some good money and their life is fulfilled. I'm just not like that. ", " >>6946228>Science often explains why, you must be some failure in STEMDon't see the logical link between the two, also no I'm not a failure in STEM, I got my diploma and all (equivalent to MSc in the US) which is worthless in my eyes because you can get it without understanding jack shit about the subject.As to science often explaining why, I would be interested to hear the examples you have in mind.Usually the 'why' explanations are 'how' explanations thinly disguised, or even plain reifications that do not explain anything. \"Why does the object accelerate? Because a force is applied on it\" does not explain anything because force is a goddamn concept not a physical entity. \"Why does a ball thrown upwards decelerate? Because its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy\" is not an explanation either, energy is a goddamn concept as well, the ball decelerates because it just does near a massive body and we don't have any deeper explanation, we're just reiterating the observation that it does just like other objects. Despite a popular belief spacetime in relativity is a concept as well, a tool of thought as Einstein himself put it, not a fucking physical substance or entity actually getting curved, it's a mathematical tool, so there again saying stuff is attracted towards the Sun or the Earth because spacetime is curved is not an explanation, it is a reformulation inside the theoretical framework of general relativity of the observations that stuff is attracted towards them. ", " >>6946367 (cont)And same goes pretty much everywhere in physics. Actual explanations are harder to come by. A real explanation would be \"Why does a heated gas expand? Because a gas is made of tiny things, molecules, what we sense as heat is a measure of the agitation of these molecules, and so the gas being heated means that the molecules it is made of push harder on each other, which makes them occupy a greater volume\". If scientists of the 18th and 19th century were like those we have today they wouldn't have accepted the existence of molecules, they would have considered it a superfluous assumption, and so we would have been left with the law that a heated gas expand and no one would be looking for a further physical explanation as to why this is the case.

Neither is \"axiomatic\".I would be interested to hear your definition of \"unphysical\". The assumption that there is an absolute frame is the natural, intuitive assumption. If something moves towards us at some velocity V, we intuitively know that if we start moving towards it at the velocity v then it will only be moving towards us at the velocity V-v. And it might just be the case with light, the point is we cannot measure the one-way speed of light, in all experiments all we ever measure is its two-way speed, and that two-way speed can be measured to be constant even if it is not the same on the way out and on the way back. It is axiomatic to postulate that the speed of light is always constant (remember, we do not measure its one-way velocity). It is not axiomatic to show that the constancy of the measured two-way speed of light is a logical consequence of objects being length contracted and time dilated by the factor sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) when moving at velocity v relative to some medium. The existence of such a medium is an hypothesis until it is proven, but its existence allows to provide a plausible physical mechanism explaining why we always measure the two-way speed of light to be constant.

Regardless, I personally have no problem (maybe educated away) with constant speed of light of QM non-intuiveness, so I don't actually feel the need to explain any why here - just correct the faults in that are there and understand the models better. I'm not into phenomenology - shut up and calculate - either, but you want to replace something just because you have a hunch it could be better. But to that, your claim that people don't think at all about the behinds of theories is just not true. People try to expand some theories in the obvious ways (this are the \"uncreative accounts\", if you will), see e.g.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_general_relativityThe notion of time in loop quantum gravity is very beautiful, to me, and I also don't blame the people who work out strings since 40 years, the geometry is pretty fine too.But then there are also more radical approaches like Cellular Automaton approaches to the workings behind the behaviour of the universe etc. I'd say people like Christopher Isham are also creative physicists, who try to apply cool tools to shake some of the foundations. And>>6946375is right, the axioms don't come first for physicists - they use the tools they need (and know of) on the fly, or the good people introduce some.Related to the thread, but of course not in your spirit, there is a logical treatment of special relativity out there, pretty syntetic, seehttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.0973v1.pdf ", " >>6946471>Of course it implies the medium does not exist.It does not, repeating what you've read on some shit website doesn't make it true, all it implies is there is something weird going on because whatever velocity we are moving at towards light we are always measuring its two-way velocity to be the same. Einstein took this as a postulate of his theory and used it to deduce the length contraction and time dilation formulas, but then we wonder why the two-way velocity is always measured to be the same, and that can be deduced in the first place from the length contraction and time dilation formulas. Once again, if objects moving at velocity v relative to the medium are length contracted and time dilated by the factor sqrt(1-v^2/c^2), then we will always measure the two-way speed of light to be constant. This is a proven mathematical fact. The Michelson-Morley experiment does not disprove the existence of the medium, it only shows that there is some unintuitive shit going on with or without a medium. Yet the medium explanation is still far more intuitive.>>6946488>The laws of physics are observer independent.

You sure succeeded in that. It all started from a good intention on my part, I think a lot about a lot of things, I thought I would share one of my reflections with /sci/, obviously this was not a good idea. The aether model is one of those things that is ridiculed by many inside the scientific community, because it is seen as that thing from the past before Einstein came over and supposedly ruled it out, yet in a modified way it is consistent with all experimental tests of special and general relativity while making slightly different predictions. But apparently it is kind of taboo, you cannot mention it in a paper that is to be published in a peer-reviewed journal unless you make it abundantly clear that you absolutely do not think the medium might be physical, that it is only a conceptual tool. And yet it works, and yet it can explain some of the postulates of special and general relativity (which are called postulates whatever anyone around here says). I think we could get a deeper understanding of the universe by coming up with plausible physical processes that can explain why the postulates at the basis of theories such as special and general relativity are true, for instance why do we measure the two-way speed of light to be constant in inertial frames. I gave an historical precedent supporting this idea, that in the 18th and 19th century scientists did assume matter was made of atoms and molecules they could not detect, and that this helped progress our understanding of the natural world.I thought we could discuss all that, but no that's not what this board is about.

Axiomatic systems don't have an inherent meaning, that's what models are for. Furthermore, in philosophy, one constructs a similar logic out of a formal language and uses it to model a \"real world\" which may or may not be \"the real world\", but the ultimate goal is in making inferences about \"the real world\".

People who study foundational matters today generally agree that ZFC is not a good system since it does not resemble mathematics the way we practise it.That's the gist, but there's much more to it than that. ZFC and other approaches to foundations are usually axiomatized and expressed in the language of some other logic.

Calculable universe hypothesis: that processing could calculate physical reality is accepted by most scientists based on the Church-Turing thesis, that a finite program can simulate any output that is specified (Tegmark, 2007). It doesn\u2019t imply determinism as not all definable mathematics is calculable, e.g. an infinite series. If our world is lawfully specifiable, even probabilistically, in theory a program could output it. The idea is not that the universe is a computer simulation, but that it could be, so this thesis doesn\u2019t directly contradict objective reality, but it is the \"thin edge of the wedge\". It could be falsified by a non-computable laws of physics, but none has ever been found. Indeed our world has an algorithmic simplicity beyond all expectations: \u201cThe enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and there is no rational explanation for it.\u201d (Wigner, 1960)cont.

Calculating universe hypothesis: Supporters of the idea that some calculations create physicalityinclude main-stream physicists like Wheeler, by whose \u201cIt from Bit\u201d processing (bit) somehow creates things (it). Now processing doesn't just model the universe, it causes it (Piccinini, 2007).3. Calculated universe hypothesis: That processing calculates all physical reality is the final step, thatthe physical world is just an output, but few in physics support this \u201cstrong\u201d view (Fredkin, 1990).These statements cumulate, as each assumes the previous, so what isn\u2019t calculable can\u2019t be a calculation, and without some calculating everything can't be calculated. It is a slippery slope as a calculable physical reality could be caused by calculatingand so calculated, i.e. virtual. Most prefer the second option compromise that the physical world somehow calculates itself, but processing can\u2019t compute itself.

The fact that many physical constraints also happen to prevent solving NP problems in P time could be taken as supporting evidence for this.My point about quantum physics was that, because quantum systems containing more than one particle are ludicrously hard to compute, it seems very odd that the computer programmers would choose to build our entire universe out of a zillion-particle quantum system.

These things aren't handwaved away in physics, and the objection that \"this just isn't possible in a real world\" is pure ignorance. The scale of humans is not a privileged viewpoint any more than the Earth is, and assuming that physics must fall in line with the behavior we're familiar with on our scale is as ignorant as assuming that the whole universe must revolve around our own viewpoint on Earth.In other words:\"In an objective reality, time doesn't dilate, space doesn't bend, objects don't teleport, empty space is empty, and universes don't pop up out of nowhere... and water is clearly not made up of tiny little grains and no invisible little creatures live in my body.

He cites all the major elements of quantum physics as evidence that the universe must be simulated - these bizarre behaviors could only exist as artifacts of computer coding. That a real universe would have to act in a classical manner.However, those quantum behaviors are also ludicrously hard to compute - to the point that no supercomputer on Earth can run a simulation of more than three quantum particles interacting, although they have no trouble with simulating billions of classical particles. Simulating a whole universe of quantum particles on classical hardware would take incomprehensible, mind-boggling amount of resources. (A quantum computer could simulate such a system far more efficiently, but of course the \"real\" universe has no quantum computers - that such phenomena occur is the very proof such a universe must not be real in the first place!)So the very behaviors he claims are evidence that the universe must be programmed are those that would make it ludicrously infeasible for the Universal Programmers to ever run it!

MY FINGER MIGHT BE ROTTING AWAY.Alright, so I'm a biohacker and transhumanist. I'm trying to move my way up to be one of the groundbreakers, so I figured I'd go and implant myself. In August, I'd implanted a neodymium magnet in my finger and I now have the ability to pick up paperclips with it, which is cool and my friends still don't know how- but I was told from the guy I purchased them from that I'd be able to sense magnetic and radioactive fields from afar. (I didn't believe him at first but then I asked a few teachers and looked in my textbooks, there were equations for nerve endings, and physical models like Maxwell's Law that helped support it and put me at ease)Now look, I'm certainly not a dipshit. I've taken AP Physical Science A & B. I'm a whiz at Physics and Biology. I know how radiation works. I know how the nervous system works. The theory seemed right and everything seemed to make sense, but for some reason, my magnet isn't picking up anything. I can't even get the slightest sense. I want to remove it but if I post on biohack.me I'll end up looking bad for having a failed piece of metal in my fingers.As I type, it's been burning me, I've been feeling either hot itchy burning....... or cold, dull, painful aches against the \"bone\". I don't work and I'm still in High School so should I go to a doctor? Can I just walk in for free and have them fix it for me because I'm a minor?Should I get this removed or not? I keep telling people on http://biohack.me that this implant lets me feel sensations in the air but that's really just a lie.. I don't think that this works and I don't think I was just scammed out of a great 15 dollars, it's just that these magnets don't work or I might just have an infection and progressing necrosis...

Now that a significant amount of time has passed, most of the magnetic parts of the neodyium has been removed. That is why the magnet no longer works.But there's a bigger problem than your finger, OP. The little magnet particles have likely localized in your brain (I say likely because there is a chance it's in your heart, but you're still alive so that's probably not the case) due to the high concentration of neurons and their effect on magnets. This is going to distort your brain. The symptoms: ocassional dizziness when you stand up suddenly, loss of coordination (i.e. you bump into things more often), being unable to remember what word you were going to say in a conversation, etc. It will get worse, too, but slowly.There's not much you can do, but if you put a magnet near the back of your skull, it will attract the particles previously dispersed and you'll only have issues with your vision.Good luck.

Even when you read Darwin's works, particularly his later works, they expand and develop upon his own theory. I think Darwin said something like \"light may be shed on the origins and future of humanity\", and we're only just beginning to see that with the words Anthropocene and cultural selection being thrown around at the start of the 21st century.

Sure, let's code for that.\"I use the term random to refer to the fact that the organism has no direct control over it, though I have read recently that certain parts of the genetic sequence are more or less likely to mutate than other areas of the sequence, which may be some level of control over mutations.

", " >>6788884I've heard that Darwin didn't want to publish, perhaps because he or his wife were to Christian to handle the implications, but that he was forced to when he found out some other guy had similar ideas and was ready to publish. That's of course speculation, but in any case it wouldn't be absurd if Darwin himself had some ideas about cultural evolution that went further than his writings. I thought he even wrote somewhere about evolution and human languages.Anyways, what do you think of the claim that the ideas of evolution by natural selection are incomplete, because they leave out the perspective of energy, e.g. thermodynamics? So for example Dawkins writes about a 'proto-gene' as essentially being a primitive unit of information, while Sagan and Schneider (Into the Cool) consider Darwinism as a special case of evolving open systems with feedback loops, under the laws of thermodynamics. To be more concrete, I asked a biology student once what came first, some little energy factory or a bit of information.

", " >>6788911First point ; I think Darwin's work on earthworms is his most important. His recognition that earthworms can make themselves more suited to their environment by changing the environment (bioturbation) is earth-shattering. It really has huge implications when you look at agriculture and civilisation.Second point - I don't understand why thermodynamics would disprove evolution. Organisms consume a surplus of energy which they use to grow and develop. The surplus caloric intake during pregnancy leads to the use of energy by a foetus.

Understanding a field like behavioural economics or evolution forever changes your view of the world. How do you *NOT* influence evolution or people's decisions even if you don't intend to? Where does free will lie if you understand how behaviours play into evolution?I think scientists such as myself should read novels.

", " >>6788934>evolution is just a theory ", " >>6788914O.K. so as I've read it, it is not intended to disprove evolution. Rather, the idea is that biological evolution by means of natural selection is just a special case of the evolution of what they call non-equilibrium thermodynamics systems. As another example they give hurricanes, dissipating systems and the economy. The critique, if you can call it that, is that the 'traditional' viewpoint of biological evolution is concentrated on information, thereby forgetting the perspective of energy. Their slogan is that 'nature abhors a gradient', by which they imply that life is one of nature's ways to resolve gradients on earth. One professor jokingly said he ctrl+f'ed The Origin and found zero results for the word 'sun'.I hope I'm not sounding retarded, but the question is whether life is fundamentally some kind of search algorithm that is, in principle, substrate-independent (the informational perspective), as Dennett would like it or is fundamentally a dissipation of gradients, as Schneider and Sagan hold. For me, one could begin to approach such a question by considering whether primitive life in its origins was a 'proto-replicator' ala Dawkins or a 'proto-energy-household', i.e. whether the gene or the membrane came first. ", " >>6788941That's just another idiotic misrepresentation of Darwinian evolution as a theory of how life formed. Evolution is the theory of how life (already existing) changes.

I think setting up all of your first order stuff early would help you out in the long run, especially with that independent type you mentioned.I've been looking at structured sets like this: a set is a collection of objects, and adding structure increases the amount of information conveyed by that structure's definition. A set S = {a,b,c} in ZFC introduces 3! = 6 unique theorems to the theory of Set, which already contains the axioms of ZFC itself, as they are established independent of the definition of S. The theorems generated by S are (and these will be in English as I am on mobile):{a} is a subset of S{b} is a subset of S{c} is a subset of S{a,b} is a subset of S{b,c} is a subset of S{a,c} is a subset of SThe statement, \"{a,b,c} is a subset of S,\" is equivalent to, \"S is a subset of S,\" which is true for any arbitrary set in ZF by the axiom of extensionality. Likewise, the statement, \"the empty set is a subset of S,\" is true for any arbitrary set in ZF, and follows only from the axioms of ZF.Notice that the latter three thoerems listed above follow from the first three. So, the only three atomic theorems that are generated by S are the first three listed. It is easy to extend this concept to all sets in ZF; the set of atomic theorems generated by a set Q is the set of \"x is a subset if Q\" for all singletons x in Q. ", " >>6765976This concept is extended to algebraic structures with no constants quite simply: for each non-commutative n-ary operator that a structure is closed under, every unique n-tuple corresponds to one atomic theorem. For commutative n-ary operators, every unique subset of the structure's domain and of cardinality n corresponds to an atomic theorem, plus the single theorem that establishes the commutivity of that operator. Extending these concepts to include constants is a simple task as well.The whole system is cool because it can be applied to ALL structures, not just strictly algebraic structures. It has plenty of applications when trying to prove certain theorems, because a simple formula can be used to describe a known signature. For example, knowing the number of atomic theorems a structure with a known signature generates allows you to use that signature's unique formula to calculate the structure's cardinality.I'm having a pretty good time with it.

It thus covers all of mathematics, no matter how abstract it might be.

The property of being a book exists, for example. ", " >>6642968In the end, it just boils down to how we analytically define the property of \"existence\". ", " >>6642971Existence in an abstract sense... what a long-winded way of saying nothing at all! Let me ask you: does One exist? does Two exist? i'm talking about the numbers.What is the essence of Two? what is the essence of Three? How is it that without knowing the answer to this question I am able to use \"two\" and \"three\" unambiguously in conversation, so that when I ask someone to bring me two apples, he will return with exactly two apples? Because the essence is irrelevant; He simply counts \"one, two\" while grabbing an apple each time and returns to me. Of all ideas, this platonic notion of \"essence\" has probably done the most damage. It tricks people into thinking that words have referents, that when we use a word, it must refer to some object. Yet, they need not; a number need not actually exist for us to speak numerically. ", " >>6642979Interesting, too, how mathematics sidesteps the notions of \"meaning\" and \"essence.\" Mathematics doesn't tell us what Zero is, but it tells us how it's used: a + 0 = 0, for all a. And that's all it needs to provide us with: a rule for usage, not a statement of essence. What is One? I don't know, nor do I really care; all I concern myself with is the property that for all a, 1 x a = a. It doesn't matter what One is.

This is why existence proofs aren't necessarily proofs by example. If you want to \"expand\" the idea of \"existence\" to include \"abstract concepts\", it becomes meaningless. Let me ask: do only those things which have thought \"exist in the abstract\"? If so, then just say \"we think THIS\" or \"we think THAT\" instead of \"THIS exists in the abstract.\" If not, if you say that no, we don't have to think something for it to exist (in the abstract), then everything exists. And if everything exists, the concept is essentially worthless. So congratulations either way: \"existence\" is worthless if you want to include abstractions.

Here it works because there is indeed enough room, but sometimes if your initial intuition is wrong, it can be a waste of time when you realize your algebraic solutions are complex, or correspond to probabilities higher than 1 or lower than 0, etc.Anyways:Let's say X has two values -1 and +1, with P(X=1)=a and P(X=-1)=-a.Then P(X^3=1)=a and P(X^3=-1)=1-a.E[X] = a + (1-a) = 2a-1E[X^3] = 2a-1E[X*X^3] = 1So we need to find a such that 1 = 2*(2a-1).

I moved on to 3 values x y and z, got a rather big mess. Wondering if there is some standard inequality to apply to get the general n-value case.LetQ=E[X^4]-E[X]E[X^3], and you can see that if we replace the values x,y,z... with tx ty tz,... you get t^4 Q, so we can assume without loss of generality that E[X]=1, i.e. just to normalize things. So the question is, I think,: if sum p_i x_i = 1, is sum p_i x_i^4 > sum p_i x_i^3 unless x1=x2=...=x_n =1? ", " >>6588148I did it! I think...Assume data x_i, with sum p_i x_i = 1.Let y_i = x_i-1, so y_i+1=x_i. Thensum p_i y_i = 0, andsum p_i (x_i^4-x_i^3)=sum p_i ( (y_i+1)^4 - (y_i+1)^3 )=sum p_i ( (y_i+1)^3 y_i )=sum p_i ( y_i^4+3 y_i^3+3 y_i^2+y_i )=sum p_i ( y_i^4+3 y_i^3+3 y_i^2 ) [since sum p_i y_i = 0]=sum p_i ( y_i^2+3 y_i+3 ) y_i^2Now y_i^2+3 y_i+3 > 0 for any real y_i. Thus this last sumis positive, unless y_i=0 for all i, which is what we wanted.The answer to OP then is that it's impossible for cov(X,X^3)=0 for any discrete random variable X.I am wondering if we can also show the same about cov(X,X^n) when n is odd. ", " >>6588166Note that you can replace the sums above with integrals and get the same result, so the answer to OPis no. In general cov(X,X^3)=0 isn't possible unless X is constant. What aboutcov(X,X^{2n+1})? Letp=p(i)x=x(i)y=y(i)x(i)=y(i)+1sum_i p y = 0Thensum_i [ p ((y+1)^(2n+2)- (y+1)^(2n+1)) ]=sum_i p (y+1)^(2n+1) y=sum_i p [ (y+1)^(2n+1) -1 ] y ( since sum_i p y = 0 )=sum_i p y^2 ((y+1)^(2n+1)-1)/y Now ((y+1)^(2n+1)-1)/y is equal to a polynomial P(y) of the form y^{2n}+...,so it is positive when |y| is large. Thus to show it is positive everywhere, we can show it has no roots:(y+1)^(2n+1) - 1 = 0(y+1)^(2n+1)=1y+1=1y=0.But P(0)=2n+1, so 0 is not a root.Thus Cov(X,X^{2n+1}) is positive unless X is constant.If only OP were still around.I'm declaring victory and going to bed. Good night /sci/ ", " >>6588166>>6588359Neat!I still have a question though. Why can you assume that ? It doesn't seem obvious to me that you can normalize X w.l.o.g. here, since X^3 (or X^{2n+1}) wouldn't be normalized by the same factor and the cross-correlation could be different. Maybe I'm being stupid and there's an obvious reason. ", " >>6588383Since cov(tX,(tX)^3) = t^4 cov(X,X^3), we know cov(X,X^3)=0 if and only if cov(tX,(tX)^3)=0 for every non-zero t. Given some X such that E(X)is not zero, let t=1/E(X), and set Y=tX. Then E(Y)=1 and we need only show cov(Y,Y^3) is not zero. If E(X)=0, then cov(X,X^3) =E(X^4)-E(X)E(X^3)=E(X^4)>0 unless X=0.So it's no loss of generality to assume E(X)=1to begin with. Same for general 2n+1 instead of 3.Quite happy with how this worked out!

Then an \"example\" was given: coordinates of a particle. You know coordinates can be arbitrary but spectrum of operators in Hilbert spaces are compact sets and R itself is not compact.

You generally can't just let the math lead you to an answer, you actually have to understand the concepts as well. That's not surprising, physics is considered one of the most difficult fields to major in because it requires mathematical rigor and a deep understanding of the actual physical phenomena. Some professors aren't as mathematically rigorous as others in their derivations, but that doesn't mean physics cannot be backed up by the math in a wholly consistent manner. In my experience, and that might be different depending on where you went to school, upper division mathematics were taught as physics courses so they could focus on the stuff that was going to be useful since they can't expect every physics student to takes the same courses as a math major plus the physics shit.

It's much easier to rely on your intuition than to actually work things through. ", " >>6550733It's not at all a pitfall, it's extremely important and useful. Any good scientist knows how and when to make approximations, and the limits that approximation puts on the model. Being \"wrong\" is perfectly fine as long as you're not wrong to your desired accuracy. This is why expanding functions into Taylor Series is so important in physics, because you can choose the accuracy you need and approximate off that - many of the basic forms of equations you see in physics are just first order linear approximations, but they convey a lot of conceptual information in a simple equation. In that sense, the only room for error is the error you allow. ", " >>6548741 ", " >>6550763No, this isn't what I meant. It's possible to end up with things that look right but aren't right.

It can lead to new insights But, it rarely leads the way in discovering new physical theories. Case in point, Newton came to his laws basically through a mixture of intuition and mathematics. This approach has the downside of generating some bad knowledge. For instance, Newton believed that the chromatic aberration of a lens was an intrinsic property of its power and could never be corrected. But, if he held out for the level of rigor you demand it would have delayed mechanics by hundreds of years.Sacrificing rigor produces more mistakes. But, it also produces some wonderful things that couldn't have been produced otherwise. Like Schroedinger's equation. The higher error rate must simply be looked at as the price of these ideas. It is a small price to pay considering the value of the knowledge we've created.In mathematics you don't have experiments so everything must be done extremely rigorously so you know you are right. In physics we are modelling reality so ultimately all that matters is if the models match experiment. We can shoot from the hip to get our theories up and running more quickly. Once they are up we can do an experiment and get the only answer that matters. If the experiment works then people like you can come in and make it rigorous. Nothing is stopping that. But, you do need to appreciate the value of shooting from the hip so you can understand how a large number of scholars create new knowledge. That's why you take physics.

Besides any fucked up shit about school, kids used to be trained to be efficient in some field.

They frequently had guardians, or at least access, to people who did complicated yet sensory detectable tasks. Nowadays homes have no books, kids are kept from doing anything hands on, and they're told never to be outside alone.

Or they are encouraged to reproduce what has already been done - stagnation. ", " >>6495178Dual-n back tasks have been used in kids. I think they did like one week, one month, and six months checking school grades. After six months their grades were higher. There's probably a time lag, as the increased attention/short-term memory capacity would only show up when other brain centers handle the information, and more likely will show the most effect when someone is under stress (higher fluid intelligence strongly predicts thinking capacity while under stressors).Action-video games tend to improve the visual system: improved vision (by as much as 20%, cluttering effect), reduces gender differences in math comprehension while improving overall, improves decision making speed about at least visual tasks (25%), and in older adults can improve driving/functional-field-of-view by about 100% (probably reactivates inactive paths, but as it improves young people too it may improve max ability). Unreal Tournament has been the most extensively studied. There has been limited testing of dyslexics, but it tends to substantially improve dyslexics and the worst performers, as they are the most strongly hit by cluttering and other sensory rate/capacity problems. Another term is contrast sensitivity.Both of the above can improve attentional shifting rates.Memorization and practice have been largely the only thing found to improve memory, and reading speed. Reading speed can be initially be improved by visual training, but after that, there has only been practice being the factor in determining in rote tasks like that.A tetris game has been used to improve dyslexics, where twelve hours is more effective as one year of traditional training or spontaneous development. In this case, one eye is the dropping blocks, and the other is the playfield. The brain coordinates the visuals better both inside and by the eyes, presumably.http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130228124132.htm ", " >>6495236>implying polymaths care about the usefulness of what they know ", " >>6495261All of the more diverse or \"conflicting\" tasks have been verified as increasing brain density, using more tissue, and in certain dyslexic cases, normalizing brain function. To even give an example of the weakness of most minds, even twelve hours of Tetris in women increased the density of tissue between the hand and eye centers.Plasticity improvements for memorization tend to be hit-and-miss. The hippocampus can be trained like in the method-of-loci, but I'd bet these people don't remember their competitive stuff days or weeks later. Plasticity can be double edged as it can be effective to unlearn things, which is probably why certain otherwise very memorizing jobs (lawyers, doctors, etc) can be completely and total assholes, as they probably don't remember events like other people. Roteness also tends to unbalance things and make people less empathetic though.The right parietal lobe is usually most easily effected by sensory/visual training, and often while math can be done on the left-side only, the best mathematicians and people with more realistic event processing (less assumptions, better accuracy without needing words) use the right parietal lobe. The right frontal areas tend to have errors in stuff like OCD, and in psychotic disorders, there's a breakdown of right hemispheric functioning while the left elevates in all but depression. I wish there was more research on the effect action video game training had on these people. Depression on the other hand tends to increase right-side activity, especially in the front, and these tend to be people with less information discarding or empathy issues, unlike the OCD/delusion people.

", " >>6353387Programmer here.It wouldn't surprise me at all if humans couldn't solve the Halting Problem. Humans don't actually have some magical ability to work out code. The way humans actually read programs is, we run the programs in our heads, step by step. And if we run across a pattern that we know will result in an infinite loop [which the Halting Problem doesn't forbid; it only forbids being able to tell if ALL programs halt], or else the program runs for too many steps and doesn't seem to be getting anywhere [The Halting Problem doesn't forbid making sloppy guesses at whether a program will stop or not] then we figure it's probably in an infinite loop and try to fix it.Humans understand code by pretending to be Turing machines.Anyway, brains are physical objects - which means brains could be computer-simulated. That means that anything a brain can do, a Turing machine can do, by running a simulation of a brain and feeding it the right inputs.So, because Turing machines can be proven not to be able to solve the Halting problem, therefore brains can't solve it either. ", " >>6353666Hey, could you tell me why exactly can't such an algorithm exist (a general algorithm for the halting problem)? Is it because there are cases when you can't decide if it will result in an infinite loop or not, or is it because such an algorithm would have to be \"infinitely complex\"? ", " >>6353705(Not that guy)>Is it because there are cases when you can't decide if it will result in an infinite loop or not,This. As an example, consider >>6353427. In general, if the halting problem were decidable, you could compute the correctness of a whole lot of mathematical conjectures; for every claim of the form \"for all x, P(x) holds\", you could write a program that infinitely searches for a counterexample to P, that is, an x such that P(x) does not hold, and halts whenever it finds one. Then this program halts if and only if the conjecture is false.The proof that the halting problem is undecidable roughly runs like this: assume that there is a program that tests whether a given program halts. Then I could write a program that tests whether it itself would halt; if so, it starts an infinite loop; if not, it halts. Thus, the halting-problem-solution algorithm was wrong. Therefore, it can't exist. ", " >>6353705It's actually really simple to explain why.Assume that there IS a program which does solve the Halting Problem. Let's call itDoesHalt returns TRUE if and only if P halts on I.Thus, given this program, we could construct the following string/code Z:ProgramZ( String x){IF DoesHalt(x, x) THEN loop forever.ELSE Halt program.}In other words, you feed it a program, and use your magic DoesHalt function to see if that program halts when fed itself as an input.If that program halts, then run forever (don't halt Z.)If that program doesn't halt, then halt Program Z.So what happens if we run Z with Z is an input?Let's say that Z halts. So,Case 1: Assume Program Z halts on input Z. Therefore, the Halt program will return true on input (Z, Z). That's what we're testing for, after all. Because Halt returned true, Program Z will run forever. Therefore, Program Z will not halt on input Z. Whoops! That's a contradiction.Okay, okay. Let's say that Program Z DOESN'T halt on Input Z.Case 2: Assume Program Z loops forever for input Z. Therefore, DoesHalt will return FALSE for input (Z,Z). Because DoesHalt returned FALSE, Z will terminate. Therefore, Program Z halts on Input Z. Shit! Another contradiction.So no matter what we try to do, if DoesHalt exists, this program breaks all of logic by proving a contradiction.Therefore, DoesHalt can't exist.

Then we should both post on topic, should we not?And clearly racism has nothing to do with this thread, and is against the rules, and also not on topic. So do not post it. Now, back to the topic:There really is an infinite number of colors in the rainbow, as all the frequencies of light are there. Indigo is blue-violet, a different color than blue or violet. There is also blue-green and yellow-green, red-orange and yellow-orange, etc. When you study light and art you study the primary colors, the secondary colors and the tertiary colors. The primary colors of light are red,green and blue- the colors used in spot lights for a stage. The primary colors in art are red, blue and yellow, the colors that can be used to make all the other colors in art. So, the colors of the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet-listing the primary and secondary colors. Indigo is a tertiary, falling between a secondary and a primary.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow\"Newton originally (1672) divided the spectrum into five main colours; red, yellow, green, blue and violet. Later he included orange and indigo, giving seven main colours by analogy to the number of notes in a musical scale.[2][8] Newton chose to arbitrarily divide the visible spectrum into seven colours out of a belief, derived from the beliefs of the ancient Greek sophists, who thought there was a connection between the colours, the musical notes, the known objects in the solar system, and the days of the week.[9][10][11] According to Isaac Asimov, \"It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet, but it has never seemed to me that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color. To my eyes it seems merely deep blue.\"[12]\" ", " >>6274108>quoting wikipediaWhy do people do this?

", " >>6274133You assume that everybody knows.And yet if everybody had read it, this thread probably would not be here. Newton chose 7 arbitrarily.In his time, 7 was seen as a holy number. In contrast, 6 is a number that is widely disliked.I presume you are aware of the number of the beast? 666? (or 616, in some versions)To see 6 colours displeased him, so he chose to count a tertiary colour as well. As I said earlier, it is a spectrum, and so colours can easily be added at will.I could easily add lime to this, and call it 8 colours if I wished. And this is not wrong; just a different way of thinking. ", " >>6274118\"Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD),[1] is an extremely rare mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately control a person's behavior, and is accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness. These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children.[2] Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent.[2][3][4][5]DID is one of the most controversial psychiatric disorders with no clear consensus regarding its diagnosis or treatment.[3] Research on treatment effectiveness still focuses mainly on clinical approaches and case studies. Dissociative symptoms range from common lapses in attention, becoming distracted by something else, and daydreaming, to pathological dissociative disorders.[6] No systematic, empirically-supported definition of \"dissociation\" exists.[7][8]\" ", " >>6274133Keep in mind that quite a few people peruse threads out of blind curiosity, or rather in search of mildly interesting trivia.
