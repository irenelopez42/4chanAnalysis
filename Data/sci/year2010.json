Remember in the Sydney 2000 Olympics, when some swimmers used body suits designed to reduce friction? Well, that material, which is called something like ny-lex or lato-ribex or something has been virtually perfected. It combines a special friction-reducing fabric (reducing friction much like Teflon), with ribulets, small V-shaped grooves in the fabric which help reduce resistance a further 10-15%, making friction effectively zero.So what you do is this:Take a large male adult African elephant, and dress him from head to toes in the friction-reducing fabric. Put him on the spaceship, and fly to about 150 miles up (about 240 kilometers). This will put you in the thermosphere, at about the maximum height where the elephant won't catch fire. Push the elephant out of the spaceship.A large male adult African elephant weighs about 7 tons. According to my quick calculations, an elephant free-falling for 150 miles without friction, should reach the ground (at sea-level) at a velocity of approximately 50,000 metres/second. Using the simple momentum calculation we all know from physics class (p = mv), the elephant's momentum should be about 7,000 * 50,000 = 350,000,000 kg m/s. An elephant hitting the ground with such a momentum will deliver the equivalent of about 10,000 atomic bombs.

I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father\u2014loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I\u2014who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds\u2014 have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.\" ", " Basically, Thomas Huxley (\"Darwin's Bulldog\") was the first to coin the term \"agnostic\" and \"agnosticism\". He defines it as a lack of metaphysical knowledge, and though shunning the metaphysical claims of some atheists he admits to being, and by extension defines an agnostic as, an atheist.If you read the greentext, and excerpt from 'The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 1', you will find that agnosticism is what most of you will would call \"only logical\" and you will also see that agnosticism is atheistic.

He doesn't think of himself as an atheist however because he doesn't place his full faith in \"weaker convictions\" ", " That more or less fits with my understanding of the terms. The terms atheism and agnosticism are not, as I understand them mutually exclusive. Atheism encompasses those who simply reject belief in deities or theological doctrine, to those who actively believe in their nonexistance. This last extreme obviously is not agnostic, but agnosticism strays close to tautology, especially in huxley's understanding: it seems to me he is saying \"that which cannot be known with certainty cannot be known with certainty.\" Huxley would fall into the category of belief-rejection if he is, as he styles himself, an agnostic. So even if his antipathy is directed towards atheists, in some sense he is one. ", " >>2159251A valid point. Many times, atheism is seen as not simply a lack of belief in deities or God, but instead a positive claim that God does not exist accompanied by both a dislike of the very idea and a dislike of religion as a whole. Such a view is not innately reasonable from logical and/or scientific perspective. In that way Huxley disassociates himself from atheism.However, Huxley admits that he is by common definition an atheist, and by extension defines agnosticism as atheistic. He is not saying that he has any of the dislikes typically associated with atheism; instead he implies that atheism is not by definition associated with those dislikes. Because Huxley in no way believes in God, he is an atheist, by his own words. ", " >scientific or real knowledge First appearance of incorrect and unquestioned assumptions.

One cannot \"50/50 on the existence of X\" when there are an infinite number of X's; it simply isn't practical. Scientifically, and perhaps logically, the most reasonable position on the existence of X is one of disbelief until there is reason to belief otherwise. Disbelief and belief in nonexistence are also, practically, synonymous in action. If one holds no belief in X and is then shown a proof for why X cannot exist, then that person's perspective of the universe is in no way changed and nor are his or her actions. It is much like the statistical tool \"The Null Hypothesis\". One assumes no relations exist and then works to prove relations. It is simply practical.In short, lack of belief and belief in nonexistence are practically the same thing; which is what I believe Huxley is inferring when he admits to being an atheist.

I really don't expect most people to know that \"raising\" is the technical name for the location of the negative in the first sentence, or that raising simply shifts the negative from the subordinate clause where it logically belongs to the main clause, especially when the main clause\u2019s verb is suppose, think, believe, seem, or the like. (Here are two links from The Columbia Guide to Standard American English that explain it: Link 1, Link 2) However, I find it impossible to believe that anyone with half a brain would use this argument. The English language is literally filled with many common examples of raising. I'll post a few for clarity: A) \"I don't believe the mail has arrived\" means \"I believe the mail has not arrived\". It does not mean that I don't have any beliefs about the mail arriving. B) \"I do not believe we missed the last bus\" means \"I believe we did not miss the last bus\". It does not mean that I don't have any beliefs about missing the last bus. C) \"I don't think the kicker can make a 55 yard field goal\" means \"I think that the kicker can not make a 55 yard field goal\". It does not mean that I did not think about the kicker making a field goal. D) \"I don't believe in the existence of deities\" means \"I believe that deities do not exist\". It does not mean that I don't have any beliefs about the existence of deities. ", " http://www.conservapedia.com/Atheism >Atheism, as defined by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and other philosophy reference works, is the denial of the existence of God. >Charles Bradlaugh, in 1876, proposed that atheism does not assert \"there is no God,\" and by doing so he diluted the traditional definition of atheism. Since 1979, many atheists have followed Bradlaugh's thinking further and stated that atheism is merely a lack of belief in any god.[8][9] The motive for such a shift in meaning appears to be to an attempt to shift the burden of proof regarding the existence of God to the theism side. ", " >>2159537Stupid Argument #7: A \"Lack of Belief\" Definition is Useful in Debates. Some people think that a \"lack of belief\" definition of atheist shifts the burden of proof to the theist and requires them to prove the existence of their god. The truth of the matter is that the theist's claim of a supernatural god with magical powers is an extraordinary claim and requires substantial evidence if it is to be logically believed. The burden of proof is on the theist regardless of the definition of the word \"atheist\". As an analogy, if someone claimed that flying pigs existed, then they would have the burden of proof to prove this regardless of whether I told them I \"lacked belief\" in the existence of flying pigs or if I told them that I believed that flying pigs did not exist.

Huxley demonstrates a very scientific perspective on the matter and thus would agree with the my \"null hypothesis\" view on God.It all comes down to the definition of atheism as you seem to point out. He in one sentence disassociates himself with atheism and then claims to be one in another, in the perspective of believers. Some see atheism as a belief in nonexistence, a definition that I believe does not Huxley because of his stated apathy towards \"atheist schools\". Others see atheism as a mere lack of belief, which would include Huxley. Huxley claims it is the standard Christian definition of atheism that best fits him, and as already stated the only definition that would fit him is the definition of atheism as the mere lack of belief in God. But why would a group of people be defined by their mere lack of a belief? The answer lies in the fact that theism is the majority position.If theists were and had always been in the minority then atheism would never be defined as the mere lack of theism. In fact the word atheism would likely not have existed at all! Instead, one would simply assume everyone is an \"atheist\" and require theists to be the ones to differentiate themselves. But theists are not in the minority. Instead, it is the LACK of belief that is in the minority then and currently. It is therefore useful to have a word that defines disbelief in God. Historically, that term has been and remains atheism. In an ideal linguistic world, there would be no words that denote a LACK of belief. However, when one lives in a world where belief X is the norm, it is practical and thus likely for a word to come about that denotes the a lack of belief X.To me, Huxley's simultaneous apathy towards atheists and claim to be one is a paradox rooted in my above semantic paradox, that atheism denotes a lack of belief despite its absurdity.

It is absurd. But then again, it is practical given the theistic majority (plus I have argued that disbelief and belief in nonexistence are the same thing from a scientific perspective).I see the arguments of both sides. And I let people define them how they will so long as I know which definiton they are using. It seems childish to stick one's feet in the sand and refuse to understand what other people mean by atheism. If one enters a conversation with a self-proclaimed atheist who from the very start of the conversation tells the other person what he or she means by atheism, then it is the other person's loss if he or she pretends the atheist holds any other view then what what the atheist just defined atheism as.Atheist: \"And that is why I believe X\".Other person: \"But you can't believe X because it goes against your prior view of [insert other person's definition of atheism]\".Atheist: \"But I already told you, that isn't what I believe. I said from the very beginning that [insert atheists definition of atheism] is what I believe\"....several minutes later when the debate has moved onAtheist: \"Which is why X leads Y\".Other person: \"But like I said before, you are an atheist so you believe [insert other person's definition of atheism]\".*atheist and the other person then proceed to kill each other in frustration*Language is nothing but a means of conveying ideas.

", " >>2159768If I may attempt a summary of the conjecture thus far:From a scientific perspective, a perspective necessarily limited to the natural world, disbelief and belief in nonexistance are the same. This is because the scientific perspective is agnostic: certainty is not possible since hypotheses stand only until disproved, and no opening is left for belief in the existence of the supernatural, as it is confined to the natural. From a more general perspective, dominant in society, disbelief is allowed exclusion from both belief and non-belief, as the general discourse requires accommodation for those with belief in the existance and nonexistance of phenomenon for which there is no evidence, and those whose beliefs are only based on evidence.The definition of atheism is allowed to include those who (absurdly) believe in the nonexistance of deities in the same sense of belief as those who believe in the existance of deities. Huxley feels no antipathy to those who call themselves atheists from the scientific perspective, but because it is easy for them to become confused with those using it in the nonsensical manner he prefers the clarity that comes with the term \"agnostic.\" "]}, "2157487": {"op": {"timestamp": 1291503600, "title": "", "comment": " Is realistic virtual reality possible?I'm talking like a planet you can go around on with accurate physics, extremely hi-resolution textures, millions of (seemingly intelligent) AI?

I'm not saying we have the tech for it right now, but if within 20 years we start switching to primarily nuclear energy; within 50 we will be able to stop hollowing out mountains for storage.Launching unreusable nuclear waste into space, with the proper technology, is NOT dangerous. If YOU knew anything about science, you would know that a nuclear rocket by sheer design would be safe. The only reason we haven't done it yet is because of cost and lack of enriched materials. Both of these can be solved by building more; which provides a plethora of good jobs to engineers, scientist, biologists, right on down to janitors. All well paid by the tried and true efficient cashflow system nuclear power provides the energy sector; just look at Europe, several of them are free of fossil fuels in their total electricity production.A nuclear rocket is safe for several reason; one in the sheer design. The containment center of the reaction would make up 75% of the ship, at least, and could be shielded using one solid heavy layer followed by several reductive lighter layers of polymer to absorb pretty much all of the reactive radiation. Layers of H3O would be slotted in between each polymer, and using a simple liquid nitrogen flow through radiators in the layers the H3O would stay plenty cool, since the reaction would only have to last long enough to get into orbit where smaller retro rockets would gently nudge it outward, on a safe course clean out of our solar system (or into the sun, if were feeling sci-fi minded). The tip of the rocket would be lined with the depleted cores, and would only have to be mildly shielded. ", " >>2077430Also it is worth noting that a nuclear rocket could NOT detonate on launch or anywhere in between. Could it potentially melt down on ignition? I suppose, though technologies could prevent that. But is the reaction going to reach enough critical energy to cause an uncontrolled detonation of all of it's content? No. Using a proper catalyst we can ensure the reaction energy required remains low enough to allow the process to go in a smooth linear fashion, without reacting all of the contents at once. It would depend on the weight of the rocket, but as long as we were financially willing to invest in say 3 small rockets at a time instead of one big one; the reaction energy needed just to get it out of our gravity is surprisingly low. The reaction would appear to be no more violent that a standard chemical rocket reaction like we use know; in fact it would probably be a much cleaner and less explosive looking thing.

Is it going to power the world, or even a fraction of it? Hell no.Nuclear Power is our future. It is readily available, extraordinarily safe (modern reactors literally can not melt down) when contained, cheap, and most of all provides more energy output than energy input than ANY fossil fuel; this is awesome because compare any other form of energy besides nuclear to fossil fuels and fossil fuels kick their ass.

", " >>2077885Certain people (Glen Beck) will enjoy spreading paranoia that an Israel capable of a nuclear power plant must also be capable of nuclear weapons.To put it simply.....god no. First of all, it is my belief we should all just disband our nukes. I mean think about it, we literally CANNOT use them; because one goes up and hundreds more will quickly follow, fucking up the entire planet. You can debate weapons and their legitimacy all you want, but the fact of the matter is owning stock piles of human species ending weapons is just.....really fucking stupid.Secondly though, energy grade nuclear materials are not NEARLY enriched enough to actually make a worthwhile weapon. It would several times the enrichment of the most powerful nuclear plants in the world to even equal something like Hiroshima. America does own a crap ton of extremely high quality uranium (and others even) however; we have some bombs with a core enriched to damn near 100%, which when coupled with their catalyst will give you an absurd amount of energy per atom. Our current nukes would make Hiroshima look like a firecracker display....I'm talking 1 mile in diameter crater, Ozone blown off in the region, fires engulfing as much as 100 miles, and a radioative fallout so large it would cover the entire planet.

The general knowledge then required to actually construct a warhead is more or less available to the educated public. The hardest part in designing and manufacturing nuclear weaponry is obtaining weapons grade fissile material. ", " >>2077981>radioative fallout so large it would cover the entire planet.Lol fuck no. Not even close to close. ", " >>2078003That's what the year of politics is for. If a worldwide nuclear plan were to be put in place, enriching uranium would not be allowed to be done by any single country, I agree. Likely an international company of sorts, regulated by all of the partner countries, would be responsible for the production and enrichment of the uranium.And yes, I would believe that would call for the disbandment of every partner countries nuclear stockpile and enrichment centers. Whether or not we can actually work close enough together to achieve a safe, effective system....we shall see.My fear is in the name of \"defending the peace of the project\" it would become heavily militarized and secretive; which wouldn't help anybody either.The world is always going to be full of crazy assholes looking to blow something up and kill a bunch of people, but we can't halt our own progress in such a desperate time because Kim Jong is a ginormous douchebag. ", " >>2078011Actually that post is correct. A modern nuclear missile, one of the bigger one's meant for metropolises, would contain enough nuclear fallout to blanket the planet. The millions+ tons of debris kicked into the air would become highly radioactive and get pushed up high into the atmosphere by the extreme heat. Here it would catch wind and end up spreading REALLY far; depending on the weapon it may not be the whole world, but at the very least the country that has been nuked will turn into a radioactive disaster zone. Even Hiroshima, small as it was comparatively, kicked up radioactive debris hundreds of miles out into the ocean. Japanese scientists STILL measure a slightly higher rate of radioactivity than normal throughout the entire country itself; in it's wildlife especially. Mutations both in humans and animals were common country wide for 30 or so years; the birth defect rate due to radioactive mutations just started to die down finally in the 90's.

Nor do you seem to have any concept of the scale of the planet and the difference in magnitude between 10 miles square and 100 miles square.>The Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever utilized by humanity. Its size and weight precluded a successful delivery in case of a real war.[9] By contrast, the largest weapon ever produced by the United States, the now-decommissioned B41, had a predicted maximum yield of 25 Mt, and the largest nuclear device ever tested by the US (Castle Bravo) yielded 15 Mt (this was due to an unexpected runaway lithium-7 reaction; the design yield was approximately 5 Mt). The largest weapons deployed by the Soviet Union were also around 25 Mt, as in the SS-18 Mod. 2 ICBM warheads.From wikipedia. As you can see here, the largest nuke ever detonated clearly did not come anywhere close to blanketing the earth in radioactive material, and the largest stockpiled weapons are no more than half as powerful as the Tsar bomba.

I know what Tsar Bomba is.Second of all do you know anything about that bomb, the reason it was detonated, or the measures installed to ensure it remained safe? It was designed to be a clean bomb, because Russia realized if they detonated it as normal it would blanket their country in fallout.A nuclear reaction takes place in stages (as I'm sure you learned from the Wiki article you linked me too). The first stage is the one that initializes fussion using uranium, a catalyst, and some form of a \"detonator\" to trigger the reaction. Once the reaction is initialized, there is usually 2-3 following stages, where layers of uranium are heated by the initial reaction which increases the yield level, and causes the production of more energy as well as radioactivity. For the Tsar Bomba Russia essentially used the last stages as a buffer to drastically decrease radioactive fallout by using lead instead of uranium, which meant it contained the vast majority of the radioactivity to just right where the bomb detonated. From the Wiki article you linked me to:>This eliminated fast fission by the fusion-stage neutrons, so that approximately 97% of the total energy resulted from fusion alone (as such, it was one of the \"cleanest\" nuclear bombs ever created, generating a very low amount of fallout relative to its yield).So go fuck yourself. The bomb was designed to NOT create fallout; had it not been designed that way it would have poured radioactive debris all over the damn place.

Cold fusion is, theoretically, possible; but I think it is far out of our current reach. Cold fusion is just a much much cleaner process than hot; and as it's name implies, it runs \"cold\". It is insanely efficient however, using little to produce a LOT. A good cold fusion reactor could, in theory, run perpetually on the same products.

Here's my vision for powered armor (not mechs, but whatever).I have good reasons to be confident that the specific power problem for high-powered devices will be mostly solved in the next 5 years, with small and quiet power sources of power density about 4x greater than LiPo batteries at maximum rated current, with capacity to operate for hundreds of hours; existing and being refined for market release. This is an assumption for the timescale, but it will happen inevitably anyway.The main limit on how armored a soldier can be is what materials are used, and how much he can carry and be effective. Since I know the guys developing nanosecond-response control systems for actuators, the reaction times won't be affected - and augmenting strength of limbs and spine will allow greater loads, even if it's just vectran ballistic mesh over the frame and skin, with riot plates in key places. That alone will let a soldier cavort about in class IV-level protection across his entire body, with power and investment calling for better information available.This brings the weight of the soldier to approximately that of a motorcycle. That's a fair amount of weight, yeah - but in a decent country (one where you shouldn't go bombing city blocks) the stairs are overengineered to withstand at least that weight. Another parallel system being developed now is presenting information in a useful way during combat. The only way this will work is with the controls system nerd basically sitting at a simulated (or real) CQC practice site, tuning whatever interface is made. This will hopefully tell the soldier where he is, where he's needed, and maybe allow other neat stuff. With camera technology, the sky's the limit (hurr hurr gps). That's speculative and beside the point anyway.

Not so bad at ground which can stand pressure, lots of bad on one that can not. Remember the stories about waterbeds or fridges falling through floors? And they really ain't heavy N/mm\u00b2 wise.And now imagine countries with lower building standards or buildings whose structural integrity got damaged before... and you need to be able to enter buildings, or the whole point is moot, if you just need some heavyish firepower, bring an IFV. ", " Also, modern firearms have enormous power, to make that enemy, say, cal .50 BMG or the russian equivalent bullet stop, you need to add a lot of weight. And there is also the question of subsystem damage, the problem with armoring joints or plain damaging the armor to a point where the whole stuff breaks down needs to be considered - it's probably not viable to put on 100mm+ of steel. At least the inside of the legs would chafe then, and if you can't do that, you add more weak points to the numerous you get due to joints.Ah, one more thing - you know how kinetic energy penetrators work? The AP/APDS/APFSDS? That's just a hard and heavy penetrator at high speeds. If it hits a tank at too long range, the shot will bounce on the armor, inside the tank the computers will fall of the wall and bits of armor (which didn't get penetrated, just due to the shock wave) will fly around and kill stuff. ", " At too short ranges, the penetrator will penetrate the armor on one side and exit on the other. Computers will fall of the wall, pieces of armor flying around will kill and if you're really unlucky, the penetrator will go right through you.At optimum kill distance, however, the shot will enter on one side and NOT exit the other but bounce around on the inside: Hamburger heaven.Now imagine all these problems with hard shell armor on a person, especially the last one.Ah, and all this is not even talking about HEAT weaponry, you'd positively need to get active defensive systems against that:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Active_Protection_Systemor the like.But IEDs, who also come in the shaped charge variety, can't be fought with this.So: I'd love to see the concept work, armored exoskeletons for assault troops, impervious to insurgent fire (if you're not afraid to die, less collateral damage happens). This could work really well in an asymmetric engagement and would render the oppositions old equipment largely worthless.Until someone sells them their own power suits or weapons to defeat them, that is.Maybe because they're right at the moment the good guys and fight the evil russians? Anyone? No? Thought so... the feeling to be shot down by a stinger given as a generous present from your own country must positively suck.Cheers, Anon ", " >>1988334That's a little extreme.There's no reason why you can't fashion armour that would distribute the kinetic force of a bullet impacting up to say... a .44 round.Yeah, you aren't covering the big heavy shooters, but few people are *capable* of shooting .50cal rifles. You'd find that you'd be dealing with 9mm ammo alot of the time. Probably 7.62 ", " >>1988330>>1988334>>1988338Are you arguing that since there are counters to it that it shouldn't be made? That line of though would nullify almost every piece of military equipment as there will always be a counter. ", " >>1988354I'm not talking sniper rifles, just your run of the mil DShK.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DShKNot really what one would call uncommon, compare it to a browning m2. Of course a rather heavy piece of equipment for partisans - but still, I would set the limit at that caliber, to be on the safe side.And that gun can shoot right through average (american) houses, and I'm not talking your average trailer park.The current armor/firepower race is definitely being dominated by the firepower. The heaviest serial produced tank was built in WW2 (the jagdtiger if anyone cares), because that was when armor was still useful - all modern tanks are way lighter and through their mobility more akin to medium tanks than the heavy tanks of that time.This is just beginning to change with the advent of hard kill systems.One Idea would be to use a shield, just like medieval times, to protect against the majority of the incoming attacks or the most powerful attacks and the armor itself defeat anything up to an assault rifle or a grazing heavier round.Heh, imagine carrying a sword, wading through the ak fire to chop the enemies up - if the onlookers don't give up that very second, they deserve their 100 6-year old virgins or whatever the religion in question promised them. ", " On the other hand, one could limit at 7.62x54R, the classic AK round, but let's not forget, there are also armor piercing rounds available for the common military calibers, so these would need to be defeated, too, or a military application would not be possible and that is the only application where enough money could be put behind the research required, although I can imagine spin offs to crowd control/police actions or prison management.And, by the way, a 9mm penetrates more sandbags than a 5.56 - because of diameter pressure (I hope that's the right translation), the 5.56 simply breaks apart because it can't take the strain, even tough it is a rifle cardridge and the other a (tiny) pistol cardridgeBut that doesn't mean that the 9mm can punch through more mm of steel.But just as I was thinking about it: Sloping is also a big part and hard to implement on human shaped armor.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloped_armor ", " >>1988592No, just that you can't slap on some armor which defeats, say, a .45 and wander about in a war zone where nastier stuff is flying around - because at some point you could actually increase the damage you're taking - instead of a nice and clean pierced muscle, you have a shredded piece of hamburger. That's something a designer would need to think about, the equation 'moar armor=moar gud' is simply not that easy. ", " The stresses on legs get very high as mass increases, even with six or eight legged vehicles. The materials strength required for the legs of a humanoid biped mech over about 10 meters in height exceeds all theoretical maximums allowed by our current understanding of physics. Not just materials physics... physics as a whole.Plus all of that mass is rested on (relatively) tiny feet so they'd sink into hard ground like ours sink into swamp, sand, or snow. Tank treads are designed to distribute weight to the point that they put about as much pressure on a road as a bicycle does. Plus their low profile makes them difficult targets, and gives them the ability to handle much higher recoil (and, therefore, larger power guns).There is just no reason to build a mech rather than a tank. ", " I would be against a battlefield mecha, for the reasons listed by others here: armor is insufficient (assuming you want to be more mobile than an MBT) to defeat the stuff they're shooting there.But I could easily get behind the idea of an urban warfare mech, like the Landmates of Appleseed (sans the unprotected arms of the operator): larger than a human, but way smaller than tanks, and sporting armor enough to defeat most common rifle rounds, if not the AP variants. This would give the unit human-like mobility, tank-like speed, staying power and the firepower of an APC (high-caliber machine gun or Gatling) for light anti-armor work and anti-infantry.Also, these mecha could be used for disaster relief work, where they can be deployed wider and faster than a crane with smaller, but still significant lifting power. ", " >>1988829No. They can't. Mechs, even small ones, would not move quickly without immense amounts of lightweight power and much stronger motors or artificial muscles or whatever than we have even designed in theory. A crane is cheap, simple, and fast. The technology has been tested over thousands of years and is quite well understood.Just because you can imagine a big person being useful in a crisis situation does not mean science can construct one that would be. ", " >>1988842Hell, even the 'power armor' (for want of a better expression) designed by the US military (I believe someone already linked a youtube video of it) could be considered a mech, and would be useful for clearing away debris.Yes, a crane is cheaper, but cannot deploy fast enough (requires time to ship all the parts, build it, power it up, etc) nor to as many areas (you need to clear away the debris before you can ship the crane there or build it). A humanoid robot/mech could traverse the debris fields and clear them away without as many troubles as a crane, although it WOULD be more expensive up front.As for the feasibility, yes, powering the suit would be a problem, but one that can be solved using umbilicals and maybe an internal combustion engine on board.

The best use for a tank is as a shock units on open ground: get in there fast, blast everything, and secure the area for the infantry.

Women want many, overlapping partners to invest time and effort into supporting them and their kids. Naturally they want to have the best man they can get to father these kids, and the best man they can get to father them. This does not have to be the same man for any of her children. Once you secure support from a man by ensuring he is attached to you, or to one or more of your kids, it is easier to risk trying to get with a better man.

The male minimum investment is very low, a single fuck. The female minimum investment is very high, nine months of work. The female is always certain of parentage, while the male is not. The male can invest in children post-partum, to raise them, but he must be sure that they are his before he does this. The female can be supported by multiple men at one time, but only if they feel invested in her. Women are the initiators of most divorces. This is some evidence that they are not as interested in long-term relationships as they claim. Romantic comedies always involve a woman leaving one guy for another guy, with some overlap. The ultimate fantasy is being stolen away by some better man. For men, these kind of fantasy stories involve being able to sleep with dozens of women, then falling for one and resisting the urge to be with anyone else. ", " >>1978892Doppelganger?

It encourages men to prefer situations of monogamy with women they are serious about. The divorce thing is not opinion. 75% of divorces are initiated by the woman. Unless it is possible to show that men are more difficult to put up with than women, which I don't think is so, then women must be more likely to give up on relationships.

Promiscuous women are more likely to birth children, infected men are more likely to be put out of the equation so uninfected men can contribute to an infected child.

And you look in the Toxo genome, and it's got two versions of the gene called tyrosine hydroxylase. And if you were a neuro-chemistry type, you would be leaping up in shock and excitement at this point.Tyrosine hydroxylase is the critical enzyme for making dopamine: the neurotransmitter in the brain that's all about reward and anticipation of reward. Cocaine works on the dopamine system, all sorts of other euphoriants do. Dopamine is about pleasure, attraction and anticipation. And the Toxo genome has the mammalian gene for making the stuff. It's got a little tail on the gene that targets, specifies, that when this is turned into the actual enzyme, it gets secreted out of the Toxo and into neurons.

If I have assumed wrong, I want to attribute it to my lack of education on the subject. This is all based on my own ideas. So, people have trouble envisioning spaces. The average person has trouble viewing things in three dimensions; sure, you can tell distance- but can you envision objects as existing from all angles? Can you, whilst paying attention to everything else, be aware of the fact that they exist as more than just the flat image you see? People see stereoscopically; that is to say, that while things appear to be three dimensional, it's actually a trick caused by the combination of two side-by-side 2D images, one from each eye. This is most easily noticed by looking past an object at a further object- you can't have them both in focus at the same time. This is because vision is two dimensional. Depth exists, but perception of it is technically illusory. This results in an instinctive preference for 2D media, which is what makes three-dimensional art difficult. The average brain simply isn't trained for three-dimensional imaging. "}, "replies": [" So imagine the difficulty of throwing a fourth dimension into the mix. It's difficult to even perceive. But wait! There's a way! You see, if you hold a three dimensional object in front of a light, it casts a shadow. That shadow is purely two-dimensional, disregarding variations in the quality of the surface cast upon; the shadow has no depth, it cannot pool. In the z-axis, it exists at a pure zero mark. This is how we are able to represent three dimensions in two- we observe depth as a shadow of sorts. The still images sensed by the brain are nothing more than the reflections of light from things- from instant to instant, depth does not exist. It's something like the argument about the arrow, wherein every instant the arrow is not moving but in real time it is moving swiftly. It can be theorized, then, that a four dimensional object would cast a three-dimensional shadow. You wouldn't be able to manipulate it, per se, just as you cannot manipulate a 2D shadow except by moving the surface it is cast upon. It is possible that a 4D object could only cast a shadow upon the surface of another 4D object; I am unable to perceive whether I have any, and therefore cannot test my theory. However, the shadow can be made in three dimensional media. ", " My prevailing theory regarding 4D spaces follows this general line of thought. Let's start with a 2D coordinate plane. We can add a third dimension by bending the plane; Let's say it's a window screen. Placing a rock in the center warps the screen, curving it downward. Now, looking at the way that the wires bend around the warping, you can see what the addition of depth does. Some of the holes between wires are stretched outwards; while we know obviously they have changed in area because we're working with a 3D media, were it 2D the surface area would have vastly increased while the circumference stayed the same. Try and envision it now in three dimensions. The surface area is untouched, while the volume ramps up drastically. You could compare it to a bag of holding from D&D. I can wrap my mind around it, sorta, but as soon as I try to figure out where in the 3D space your coordinates would be, I get a headache. Am I full of shit?

More than half othem probably are stacked up in warehouses without any launch system.Even if for some reasons all the nukes were fired, North America would probably not even be touched because they're just too far away and will have more than enough time to deploy counter measures. Russia is also way too spread out to take severe damage in terms of population, the only major losses would be the infrastructures in key cities.

Because humans will consume according to their means, not according to their needs, there will never be a lack of jobs, as demand will increase to meet available supply of work. So what types of jobs are created -- just look at the US or other 1st world country, because this happened more in the past than it will happen in the future. The US used to be mostly manufacturing and farming jobs. Now 99+% of that manufacturing and farming work is done by machines. That doesn't cause unemployment or \"post-scarcity\". Instead it causes an increase in the standard of living, and jobs that fill the industries that increase the standard of living. As just one example, consider all the places you can pick up the phone and call, that will bring food to your door right now. Many, many people are employed in food preparation and food service now, whereas very few were so employed when everyone was manufacturing or farming. So people now spend their money on restaurants and are employed by restaurants. It is just one example of a destination industry that is filled by labor that is displaced by technology, and funded by our increased wealth from the benefits of that technology. One can't predict the particulars, but one can predict that the principle will always apply.

Those in power will invariably become weak after generations of comfort and pleasure. Other smaller, smarter, and opportunistic groups of people will gain strength and wait for the lumbering behemoth to fall, doing a bit here and there to bring about its doom. In the ensuing power vacuum, a brief period of economic or military sable rattling will determine the winner for the next span of generations. In the proceeding time, this group will expand, absorbing smaller factions within its reach, bringing them all eventually under a single glorious banner. With time, the exceedingly diverse interests of this large nation will slowly drive it apart, creating rot from within, which inevitably is the first step in repeating the whole process This will of course continue until the point that humanity finds a consciousness capable of accurately reflecting on more than its own lifespan, and through totalitarian control of government, religion, wealth, and genetics will succeed in turning the human species in an entirely new direction. Yet like all great empires, this too will fall, leading to the most terrible power vacuum in human history, whose atrocities will be legend for millenniums to come, planting the seeds for the next generation of humans to band together, as before, repeating the process all over again.To infinity ", " > future of humanity.biggest challanges for humanity that we will eventually overcome, but it won`t be without a fight.- international capitalism- islam- chinaBy the time we solved these problems singularity will arive.

Factions arise as rebellions are left uncontrolled for long periods due to lack of FTL travel, pirates are everywhere, so freighters all travel with large escorts. Aliens have not been found, it is merely humans fighting humans (or the AI's representing those humans), aiming to ensure the survival of themselves, and trying to remove all potential threats around them.Most colonies are bio-domes on planets, with some being just massive cylindrical spacecraft, spinning to imitate the gravity of the home planet of it's occupants (the same design for seed ships).The main empire of humanity is centred on Earth, it's homeworld, where all information is sent to, processed by the massive quantum supercomputers spanning the whole planet, which simulate almost all possible courses of action, choosing the most beneficial, then orders are sent out as encrypted radio waves for actions to be taken on the borders of the empire.

Those who choose to live in virtual worlds, and those who choose to live in the physical world. Virtual worlds vary a huge amount from individual to individual, whilst technology available to those in the physical world is the stuff of our dreams, almost anything is possible.And for the looks of humans, it varies hugely. Depending on the gravity of their home, they can be short and muscular, or taller and thin, and weak.

Huge Hydroponic farms can be built on the deserts. Nanotech will give us advances in Carbon Nanotube technology, enough to build a Space Elevator and large, ultra-light, scramjet-powered spaceplanes that change in shape as they move through different layers of the atmosphere. We will finally be able to move large amounts of cargo and people into space, and for the first time in years, once we achieve this, the Space Age will begin.

Some of them will be small inflatable modules, while others will be large Bernal spheres that house entire ecosystems and can act as a port for all interplanetary ships.Nanorobots will be sent to the Moon, where they will reproduce using the local resources, and with those same resources they will build an Asimov Array: An array of photovoltaic cells around the lunar equator, several millions of square kilometers in diameter. Enough enrgy to power the entire Earth, and there's still plenty of excess energy to allow industrial growth. And there will still be plenty of excess energy. What to do with that? Underground particle accelerators will manufacture antimatter, and that amount of energy pumped into them will give us a rate of several kilograms per day.Antimatter Valkyries will leave the solar system at near-lightspeed, carrying small human crews to the nearest stars. And they will come back: Microbes from Alpha Centauri, photos of inhabitable moons of gas giants around Tau Ceti, and a book on the biology of a planet in Procyon inhabited by centaur-like beings in the paleolithic stage.We'll colonize the Moon, and Mars, and send some probes to Venus. Interplanetary rockets will carry hundreds of scientists on missions all over the solar system, while hundreds of probes are deployed to explore the small moons we never considered important and find the answer to a million questions we never asked ourselves before.

A gigantic disk will be placed in front of Mars, protecting it from solar wind and radiation until we figure out how to restart the core, a gigantic disk balanced by a counterweight and a solar sail.But that's not the end. We'll mine the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Particle accelerators will be built on the moons of the gas giants. They will fire streams of droplets at magnetic sails, accelerating the Beamriders to relativistic speeds, carrying the first colonists to a brave new world in some uncharted star. Decades later, they will arrive. The magsail will act as a magnetic parachute, braking them down to a stop, and then allow them to maneuver into a world, let that be a planet or a moon.The solar system will change: Entire asteroids, even moons, and possibly even planets, will be disassembled and turned into large O'Neill like colonies, orbiting the Sun, and the solar system will become a true Dyson Sphere.By that time, Homo Sapiens will be gone.

Like an architect creating a building before handing off the design to contractors to build it. The second creation begins in Genesis 2:5 which readsAnd every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. We don't get an actual account of the physical creation of the world in the Bible. This we can assume is the 6 billion+ years that occurred which we see in the fossil record of the Earth.There is no conflict between the Biblical account of the creation and the scientific understanding of how the Earth was formed.

There are no definite rules, just an agreement among scientists so they have some kind of unified work method.The chiral carbon atom has 4 different ligands, that's why it's chiral (DERP).Each ligand has a priority. H will mostly have the lowest.For single atoms as ligands, the priority increases each higher atom number: C<N<O<F.Using this logic, bigger ligands, like an ethyl, has a higher priority than a methyl.The double bounds, need to be undoubled, the picture shows you how that is done. To see if the chiral atom is S or R spinning, you put the ligand with the smallest priority, behind the chiral atom, then you will have 3 ligands to determine.If the decreasing in priorities goes clockwise, it's R, counterclockwise it's S.That's all there is to it. ", " >>1355261well sterocenters have 4 different groups (which is why they are stereocenters to begin with)... the idea of this R and S is to rearrange the molecule so that the highest priority is pointing out of the plane of the page towards you and the lowest priority is pointing into the plane of the page away from you... and then you just go from highest priority to lowest priority... and if that order is clockwise it's R and couterclockwise it's S ", " you all gets tiny cheezburger!

Force is measured in Newtons. weight can be measured in Newtons because there is acceleration (gravity) and a mass (whatever object). The acceleration due to gravity acts upon the object, and imparts a force equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration. BTW, there is another formula for impulse, which is ( i think) force over distance. Impulse is F \u2022 t = m \u2022 ?v. This is a little more complicated, and you'll have to read up on this. in technology, force is literally everywhere, but right off the top of my head would be in car testing, brakes impart a resisting force on the disk, and slows the moving car.

He highlights the historical connection between NASA, the Department of Defense, and the \"military-industrial complex\". Moore also said, he will address the plans of the next wave of space exploiters commonly called NuSpace. \"It's scary when you think about it. You have guys like Elon Musk, born and raised in apartheid South Africa, being the Bill Gates of space and doing to the solar system what Big Oil did to the Earth.\" Moore also blames space advocacy groups for the rise in space exploitation. \"(Robert) Zubrin, what a bastard! He's the sort of guy, if he lived 100 years ago, who would have gave blankets infested with smallpox to Indians. His outer space version of Manifest Destiny is just as imperialistic as the one we used as an excuse to take this land for its indigenous population.\" I asked him if man should go into space at all. \"To expand our knowledge; for man to realize how small and insignificant we are in the vast universe, sure. No problem with that, but that's it.\" According to Moore, the main theme of his documentary is that time is running out for capitalism and that it's interest in space is a sign of its impending end. \"Markets are drying up. Resources are growing scarce, and the people are telling their leaders that they don't want 90% of the wealth in the hands of 1% of the population.

This is part of the reason we don't consider Marx's theory of history science: it is not falsifiable because the theory can always be expanded to explain everything. So now we have a new question: Is falsifiability a necessary prerequisite for a sound scientific theory? I would have to say so, especially after the downfall of induction. Falsifiability has become central to modern scientific hypothesis- and theory-making. If you cannot falsify a theory, then it stands to encompass all; that which cannot be disproven cannot be proven.

I think most will agree with me when I state that it is, \"The genotypic composition of populations change with environmental pressures based on survival and reproduction (such as natural selection, population drift, the bottleneck effect, etc).\"So the simple answer is that, if you can falsify this statement, then evolution is falsifiable. Presumably, if we were to observe a case in which environmental forces changed dramatically and the genotypic composition of a population did not change in the expected manner, then the basic principle of evolution would be falsified.

In this case, evolution does not apply to non-living entities. The theory of evolution is powerless to explain how a rock formed, how it is that the earth became covered in water, or how the universe formed.
