Is air really that powerful?If it is that poweful, shouldn't my body be damaged from the air?

I know the cause of it, but at the subatomic level what is the force? Is it the repulsion of the atoms? ", " 1. No difference between heat and kinetic energy, but heat is kinetic energy in random directions. 2. Yeah man, air is pretty powerful. Each particle is moving at the speed of sound (343 m/s). 3. Yeah, air pushes against the food. 4. Your body has internal fluid pressure as well which pushes back, and the intermolecular bonds holding your body together are strong enough to withstand random particle collisions (pressure). It's shear forces that you have to beware becaus e those are less random (cutting, stabbing). 5. Air particles move at the speed of sound 343 m/s. This speed is why sound moves as fast as it does. A disturbance can't travel faster than each individual particle.6. Yes. That is why there is bulging due to vacuum. We have internal fluid pressure.7. The atmosphere below them is pressing up, and above the solid object there is no atmosphere due to vacuum, so the solid object is sucked up. 8. The atmosphere presses down on the fluid so the fluid wants to go up, but normally there is atmosphere in the pipet providing counter-pressure. Remove that atmosphere in the pipet by sucking and there is net force upwards in the pipet.

For the purposes of his question, I'm just saying pressure waves/sound waves can't move faster than the speed of a particle.

In this way, it is more probable to have disorder. When you up the number of coins, it becomes far more probably to have a mix of heads/tails than to have pure heads or pure tails.Things aren't really irreversible, but the chance that something disordered becomes ordered again is miniscule because there is a far greater number of possible states that the system can take which are disordered as opposed to ordered, so most things tend to disorder only because they are more probable, if that makes any sense.

Different societies have different beliefs in what constitutes as \"smart\" and \"dumb\".

It's kinda like asking why certain societies have high IQ's on average when we know that testing and practice of mental strength was more important/frequent to them which in turn helps them score higher on IQ test.>The question is why.Because it currently yields little value to them. Doing good on a test means nothing if there are little to no institutions in the immediate area to reward them for it. Creation of revolutionary thorems probably could help them but if neither society or the environment they occuppy demand such an investment then the likely hood of them making such thorems decreases.

Anywhom, what does /sci/ think about the concept of fluid and crystallized intelligence, and what advantage do you feel each type has over the other? This isn't the best example, but I've known teenagers/early twenties individuals, who generally exhibit fluid intelligence, figure out how to work new cell phones and other technological devices rather quickly, whereas I've known older people, who generally exhibit crystallized intelligence, to take longer to figure such devices out. However, my stepdad and I were discussing this subject recently, and he says that crystallized intelligent people have an advantage because they have more experience. He created a hypothetical situation where one person with fluid intelligence and one person with crystallized intelligence found themselves in a city that neither of them have ever been to. He stated that since the crystallized intelligent person was likely to have been to several cities in his or her life and has experience travelling, it would be easier for them to find their way around.

Continuing upon my post, my stepdad and I also discussed a scenario where two men of roughly the same age (one 35 years old and an office worker, one 40 years old and a field worker) both had to put up a fence. He said the field worker had been working all his life and knows how to put up fences, which means his intelligence is crystallized, but the office worker had never put up a fence in his life and thus doesn't know how, which means his intelligence is more fluid.

Let's say a person with great fluid intelligence and a person with great crstallized intelligence take ten tests. The person with FI might get 50% on all those tests, while the person with CI might get 100% on five of those tests.This is like how the person who has put up fences all of his life does better than the office worker, because putting fences falls into one of his fields of experience. And, its why those older people can't figure out cell phones. It is because their crystallized intelligence has little to do with operating technology.The problem is that hypotheticals, to demonstrate their point, use a test the person with CI got 100% on, ignoring the tests that was outside the knowledge of the person with CI.

Anyway, into the question. If I seem mentally retarded, oops.Ok, so birds get around by flapping their wings. My question is, why does this work? If all they're doing is pumping their wings up and down, then shouldn't the law of action v. reaction mean that they wouldn't have any net force? All I can think of is that their wings are shaped like an 'n' as they fly so they \"trap\" the air underneath their wings when propelling themselves upwards, and then when they lift up their wings, the air flows smoothly around it. Yes I know that the larger birds like eagles ride thermals, but I'm wondering how they get off the ground in the first place, and how smaller birds that can't take advantage of thermals as easily get around. A large reason for me not thinking that it's as simple as just their wings are shaped like an 'n', look at the hummingbird.

", " The answer to your question is \"Lift\". It's the principle that has to do with how air moves over a certain shape. Wings are shaped so that when they slice through air it pushes them upward. Birds actually flap their wings kind of forward, in and downward, then they relax and let them stretch out to catch the air, it's not a simple \"up and down\". Also, many birds use thermals to reach very high altitudes, this has to do with the natural fact that warm air rises and is constantly pushing air upward into the atmosphere (where it's cold) from the ground (where it's warm, because sun). Birds with larger wings can actually just coast (once they get high enough) and the air currents will push them upward. Bird flight is fucking awesome.

Your mind constantly wants to make your actions into mindless habits, so you do not have to consciously think about every single thing you do. But many of our habits get in the way of being productive, like when you're studying and you feel the urge to do ...anything but studying. Like checking your email, even though you know you there's nothing new since last time you checked. Or checking 4chan, even though you know absolutely nothing good will come out of that.But instead of just accepting these distracting urges as part of reality or evidence of your lack of willpower, I think there's a very simple method to get rid of them: Go to another room. Habits are memorized, and memory works by association, so in any familiar environment, your mind automatically prepares to do what it's used to do in that environment. Lie down in your bed and your mind prepares you to sleep (which also is less effective if it's a bed you're not used to). Sit down in front of the TV to read a book, and you might find your mind is more occupied with the desire to turn on the TV than to read the book.\"Try to study away from your distractions\" is common advice, but I think it helps to know that it's not just to physically prevent you from doing other things.

I have another room I study in or I like to study at the library because there are people there ", " >>5156180Pretty much. And try to make sure you don't build up any bad habits in that room. Just doing one thing that you shouldn't be doing while studying can quickly turn into doing that one things many times.I think the same thing can also be applied when you feel like you're \"mentally stagnating\", which I believe is the main reason people recommend taking walks between study sessions and taking a vacation to a distant place after a tough work year. But that's mostly a personal theory to explain why I feel like I'm pulled into a state of heightened awareness whenever I'm put in a completely different environment (vacation, moving to a different place, etc).

It improves your life in almost every conceivable way, including your willpower and mental capabilities. Try to find some physical activity that's fun and which you'll be motivated to do every day.

This usually means writing down key concepts/formulas/definitions and writing down the most complex version of that problem underneath with a mini how-to guide of how it is solved. I prefer to use a notepad and carry it around everywhere I go. I review it whenever I'm waiting for something (the bus, when I'm not busy at work, waiting for the girlfriend to finish changing etc.) or at least make an effort to read it through once a day.

But in truth, it's the exact opposite. Your goal is learning, and the easier it is, the less you're learning. But when you're struggling really hard with something, wrecking your brain over it, you're learning at an extremely high rate.So instead of getting demoralized by tough problems, remind yourself that your struggling is just proof that you're learning, and that the more you struggle, the better a student you are.Basically, doing problems that you have easy time doing is like going to the gym and picking up weights that are way below your maximum, and then telling yourself it was good exercise because you managed to do all your reps without breaking a sweat.

The only reason I mention this is because someone mentioned cryogenics, and someone else mentioned that when you use a time machine, a copy of you and your brain is created in the future.Two things about this, and then a short explanation about why I don't care/believe in that.Firstly, if the time travel possibility is created by stretching holes in the universe, and moving from one universe to another through the multiverse, the matter might stay the same. I've heard shit about other universes vibrating at different frequencies, perhaps having your dissonant frequency in that universe would destroy you because the universe knows you don't belong. Maybe you'd phase through everything/not be affected by particle interaction (so even light doesn't affect you, the world is a shapeless, dark, quiet, tasteless feelingless place for you then) ", " Another thing is that from my current understanding, our understanding of \"I\" is merely a collection of our memories, dispositions, and such. Brain pathways. Theoretically, I could forgo the entire process of traveling from universe to universe and just freeze my brain/decode it so it could be rebuilt exactly like it is now in the future. So, the connections would all be there, my memories are intact, I'm in the future.However, that leaves the option up that the record of my brain might be damaged or destroyed. In fact, if I'm frozen, I won't be as lucky as Fry from Futurama (who survived aliens destroying his civilization... but not his building?) and my frozen crypt will most likely be damaged, broken, or destroyed along with me.I'd rather forgo this whole problem by directly stepping into another time.Also, traveling in time designates that I'm moving in this universe, from one frame of being (in the concept of \"time\" being relative and a perceptual construction) to another. I'm not sure if that's what I want to do, because I think that is harder and would take more energy.I think it would be easier if I could just \"jump\" to another universe where I'm in a different time, but it's similar enough to this universe that I don't freak out/get stuck/hate my existence.In my next post I'll discuss my theories of time-stretching and dissonance reduction. Gimme a sec. You guys are much better about this than the other boards, THANK YOU. ", " Time-stretching: If, as I stated, the biological clock can be stopped (and I've heard this is somewhat true for alligators or crocodiles, I forget which, plus it might not be true)You could essentially live forever. Couple that with the future technology of barriers and force fields (preferably private, aura-like ones) and you would be virtually indestructible. Perhaps in the future there will be a way to forgo matter interaction or even the need for a physical brain or body.Then, it's just a matter of jumping to the very beginning of one universe, and living it out over trillions of years. Then, when that universe dwindles or dies, you move to the next. And because time is irrelevant to you, you could do this endlessly with all possible worlds. I believe this is our understanding of a modern version of the \"ubermensche\" ", " I hate to put it this way, but you are banking a hell of a lot on star trek being right.Right now, as stated earlier, FTL travel is the only realistic method if time travel, and only \"forward'.

", " >>4922103The mythbuster thing was such BS though.Sure there is a giant treadmill moving backward but it's not fast enough, because the plane is still moving forward with respect to the ground (with respect to the air).Isn't the idea to have the plane stay where it is and the treadmill just moves backward to spin the planes wheels?Because it should be obvious that it won't take off.Bottom line is, it HAS to move with respect to the air, if it doesn't then it won't fly, and the treadmill isn't moving the air.... so ya.... ", " >>4922124I don't really care about the mythbusters thing.But you could possibly settle this by measuring how far the plane went before getting into the air, if its a lot less than the normal distance by that kind of plane, it may be at least a bit closer to proof that you could indeed do it from standing still position, if you managed to make a treadmill go fast enough.

", " If the air flow is faster closer to the ground (with the rough treadmill), that will generate a downward force, sticking the plane to the treadmill ", " >>4922155Well, the engines can make the air around it move of course. You are assuming that because it doesn't go forward, there will be no air movement around it. It may very well be that nearly all the air movement near a planes wings is caused by the engines and not just the moving forward. If so, it is very reasonable that it will manage to get of the ground.Of to the wonderful world of googles to try and figure out if the air movement around the wings is indeed caused mainly by the engines. And I think that is pretty likely. This hypotheses could be checked by seeing if all planes of the same type manage to get into the air at about the same speed. If they do, even with pretty widely varying wind directions it is likely that they indeed cause most of the wind movement by themselves.So basically moving forward into the air at 60mph would be the same as standing still and moving the air around you at 60mph.Now, if I wasn't a lazy bastard, I would go look for the answer to this hypothesis myself, but I am lazy. So do with it what you wish. Just remember that because it looks like something is doing something for a certain reason, doesn't mean there cannot be other reasons involved. ", " >>4922172Depends on the plane. Some antonovs use the coanda effect, most things with props will get some benefit, but airliners have engine nozzles behind the wing, so can't generate any airflow. ", " >>4922176Well, its quite possible that it depends on the plane used. I am no aviation engineer. I really don't know enough about it to give you any conclusive answer. I am sure its possible to find all of the needed answers if you really want to know if this would work for a certain type of plane. All in all, I am not sure, but its quite possible the air flow generated by the engines may be big enough to give the plane lift for certain planes. ", " >>4922172But then what role does the treadmill play?If it can take off as you described from the engines, then it could do so on solid ground without moving. It would just turn it's engines on and get into the air without moving a single inch on the ground. ", " >>4922181I guess the problem is that there isn't enough information in the question. ", " >>4922181Keeping the plane from going forward of course. I believe, and correct me if wrong, that a plane is pulled forward pretty much entirely on its engines. Thus the wheels are simply loose.The engines running will generate an air current, which will push air over the planes wings but also push the plane forward. To stop this from happening, we add in a treadmill that will generate a backward movement on the plane if the engines would not be running. Thus both cancel each other out in terms of movement of the plane but the air movement over the wings would not change, thus the plane would get liftoff.If you accepted that we can simply take a wing and attach it to a pole that allows it to move up and down but not forward or backwards, you can do this experiment on your own in simplified scale. Make a paper wing, there will be tutorials for the right wing curving to make this work. Run a small wire through the front of the wing, attach rings to the side, attach those rings to two poles on each side in such way that it can move up and down. Then take a blow dryer and blow away. If the wind is good enough, it should get lift.The treadmill is entirely unneeded, it is just here to make it so the plane will stay in the same position even tho it makes quite a bit of effort to go forward. Remember, the wind being blown by the engines will not only push the air backwards over the wings, but will also move the plane forward. ", " >>4922181The treadmill plays no role whatsoever. Any plane that can take off vertically can equally take off from a treadmill. As takeoff speed is weight dependent, certain STOL planes might be able to handle it at minimum weight, with just enough fuel to take off. A plane that cannot take off vertically may be able to with a sufficient headwind. Airflow over the wings from the engine(s) could generate lift with zero aircraft speed. Any plane can take off, vertically, with or without a treadmill, with a headwind equal to its takeoff/stall speed ", " >>4922209Great. Only the nozzles of the engines in the plane in the OP image are behind the wing, and thus generate no airflow over the wing, and no lift. They only generate forward thrust. Lift is generated only through the movement of the plane through a mass of air (in planes of this design). If it were a Hercules, say, with 4 big props pushing air over the wings, then maybe it could take off vertically. ", " >>4922209>>The treadmill is entirely unneeded, it is just here to make it so the plane will stay in the same positionRight.So we can throw the treadmill out of the problem as an unnecessary complication.So why don't planes just take of from a still position then? Because they can't.Therefore, any plane that can't do that (which is I guess all of them), can't take off from the treadmill like this.If you have a plane that can take off from a stationary position then it could take off from the treadmill. ", " >>492222222222Nice get.Yeah, as pointed out above.... ", " >>4922209But the plane will not and can not stay in the same position, no matter how fast the treadmill moves. ", " >>4922229Why not?

How could I forget that?Of course it fucking takes off, stop over thinking things; and it has nothing to do with getting the air to move fast enough instead of the plane.It would take off on the calmest day in the year, with no wind, and with no engines pushing air over the wings, or with the treadmill moving air. And before you ask, 0.999... =1, and no, pi isnt = to 4, and no, you can't tie magnets to your car to get it to move, and yes I know Im being trolled. And hell yes im mad. ", " >>4922238This. Except that it doesn't take off. ", " >>4922238but ifspeed of treadmill >= speed of planehow can it possibly take off?The only way it can take off is if:speed of plane > speed of treadmillSo don't say:>>of course it takes offwhen you are making assumptions about the relative speeds ", " I understand the original question to assume that the treadmill is moving, the wheels of the plane is moving, but if I opened the cockpit window I wouldn't feel a breeze ", " >>4922217I do not suggest that every plane will be able to do that. I don't know every plane, or even one plane well enough to tell you that for sure it will. So it is entirely possible that the plane in Ops image will not do it and others will.>>4922222The treadmill is unneeded if you do not care about the plane moving forward by its generation of force by the engines. If you want to stop it from moving forward, you will need to put some force on it that will cancel out the force that the engines put on the air in term of movement. This force would be done by the treadmill and friction.Planes will not take off from a still position because we don't make them for that. If you make the air move over the wings by the force of the engines, you will put a forward force on the plane. This isn't a bad thing for a plane since it will further help moving air over the wings. So there is little reason for anybody to make a plane with the usual plane mechanics but make it so that it requires a standstill to get off the ground. That all our planes move forward to take off does not necessary mean none of them can take off from a still position. This may simply indicate that it is way easier to have them move.Anyway, you sound like a troll to me, otherwise you would have understood it by now, or you are completely stupid, possibly as well. But I have one rule for 4chan, and its do not negotiate with trolls. If you really want to know for sure, get all the needed variables (wind generated by the engines, wind needed over the wings to make it lift off, and so on) and calculate it yourself or buy yourself a model airplane and test it yourself. ", " >>4922254Can we agree that the situation would be identical if we removed the treadmill, and removed the wheels from the plane? ", " >>4922247Imagine someone is next to a treadmill holding a RC plane on it. That person can simply hold their hand on the plane and it will remain stationary. With slight effort they can push the plane forward on the treadmill. That is what the engine is essentially doing. The thrust of a plane is produced by the engine, the wheels are free-wheeling and have no part in giving the plane thrust. The movement of the treadmill does not impede the engine's ability to push air. ", " >>4922247Why? The speed of the threadmill doesn't mater except it should make sure it keeps the plane in the correct position, thus move backwards as fast as the plane is trying to move forward. What matters to get air is how fast the air is moving over your wings. A given, if you make the treadmill way faster than the speed of the plane, it may be impossible for the engines to even create the needed wind over the wings in the right direction to get lift.>>4922260For simulation, probably. In reality, you gonna run into problems. For starters, the plane may have enough power to get itself moving, even with no wheels attached, if you, you are going to ruin the plane quite well. Also getting the plane down again will be a disaster, since once it gets lift, it loses a lot of the friction and will thus move forward.Just accept that we may have planes move forward during takeoff from an engineering perspective, not from a physics perspective. Maybe we allow them to move forward because thats simply the easiest way to do things.If you are willing to experiment, by all means, do so. But I already told you an easy to do at home experiment. Fold paper to make the right curves to be a plane and blow wind over it. If it manages to move upwards even when you stop it from going forwards or backwards, you have proven that at least on some basic level, you could manage to have a plane take off without it needing to move forward. ", " >>4922247Yes, you've got the right idea. Of course the plane will only take off if there is no air moving over the wings. The point is that this plane in the picture will always move forward at its full speed, the treadmill can't affect that.Lets say the plane moves down a normal runway at 500m/s, ok? Now turn on the treadmill at 100m/s backwards; the plane, with engines at same power etc, now moves down the treadmill at 500m/s. Now turn the treadmill on 200m/s. The plane moves forward at 500m/s.What about the treadmill at 500m/s? what about it at the speed of light? The plane still moves at its full 500m/s speed, relative to a stationary reference frame.A plane gets power from the massive engines on it, not its wheels. If you were running on spot on a treadmill and you fired a cannon strapped to your chest, what do you think will happen? You just stand there and still don't move? Or you get blasted into your neighbours kitchen? Spoiler alert: it's the latter. ", " >>4922281I meant if there is air moving over the wings in the first line, obviously. ", " >>4922254Why are you calling me a troll, I've already said that if the plane is moving relative to the ground (which is what you are saying) then it will fly... DUH it will fucking fly...The other part of my statements address if it remains stationary to to the ground, and in such a case it will obviously not fly.I guess this could be achieved by a treadmill that accelerates faster and faster backward to prevent the plane from gaining speed relative to the ground.how am I trolling? ", " >>4922281Keep that spoiler away. I want this to get tested.Where are the mythbusters when you really need them? ", " >>4922281Absolute bullshit. Yeah, there are planes that can take off vertically -- harrier, osprey, etc -- but JUST LOOK AT THE FUCKING ENGINES on any passenger jet. They do not blow air over the wings.

And you really show off your aerospace credentials by picking a \"for the purpose of argument\" take off speed that's close to mach 2 ", " >>4922281Well, there is still some friction between the wheels and the treadmill. So I am sure that the forward speed of the plane will get some impact from the speed of the treadmill. ", " this thread is such shit.The wheels are free-rolling. What pushes the plane forward is the engines. The engines are exerting force on the environment, not on the ground, so the airplane will still move forward regardless of how quickly the damn treadmill treads. ", " >>4922302My whole point is that the engines don't push air over the wings. I never said they did. It has nothing to do with VTOL aircraft. The plane takes off because it's moving at its full takeoff speed, relative to a stationary observer. Lets to another example. Imagine a small, one seater, biplane, wooden, converted soapbox. It moves down a normal runway at 4km/s. The chosen speeds are irrelevant to the question, and only relevant to one another.

Be AWARE of it all, just let it go for now and don't worry. 3. Count backwards from 10 and with every number visualize and ignoring all the other things flooding your mind.

Each level is double the relaxation of the previous and let your body sink in .4. Breath. The key is to breath. Breath in uniform patterns. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Steady, calm, relaxed breaths. Imagine an energy (give it a color, i like blue for this) enter through your mouth and settle in your stomach, spreading out through body (i like the veins and nervous system pattern of spreading) and visualize it turning red as it soaks up all those thoughts you let go, you need to let them go for now.

As I said, the brain filters out a lot of the things that you passively learn, just like you filter out the faces of the hundreds of people you pass in the street every day; the information is not relevant to your life and so your brain discards it. Some people are better at this than others; they filter out less.Active learning is better though, it forces your brain to remember; it can not discard the information, because you will not allow it to not finish the task of memory.There is a definite endpoint here that results in you having to remember the information.With passive learning, the endpoint is simply finishing reading the information, whether you remember most of it or not.

On the contrary, It only hurts those who decided to invest in those banks, unless the government bails those said industries out, then it effects us all.

Interestingly, your line of logic was also used during the beginning of the Great Depression. The notion of creative destruction by Schumpeter justified the widespread failure of banks and businesses after 1929 and it was expected capitalism would recover. Yet it took massive amounts of Keynesian spending and eventually galvanizing industry again through a world war to get aggregate demand high enough for the economy to improve. Instead, we should have done as progressives like Teddy Roosevelt did, and used anti-trust legislation to bust up the banks into many smaller competing firms.

When the dollar inflates, you get more gold. And when more people start withdrawing because they find this out, you eventually end up with no money.We had kept the gold standard after words, however, exchange was impossible. While this fallacy did keep us afloat for a while, we had to abolish the gold standard. This is where you start getting into the \"why\" conspiracies, but there had to be a reason.

They operate on cost-benefit analysis like any other naturally evolved intelligence, right? Allow me to pose a hypothetical scenario.A civilization \u2013 we'll call them the derpites \u2013 conquers its home planet and begins to grow. They have, after a brief 20th-century-like spike in technological growth and improvement of living standards, a massive collapse into poverty and lack of innovation. After many centuries, they recover; but they've learned their lesson: they now have strict population controls, and an ongoing effort to maximize output from crops.After many centuries of gradual recovery and return to the innovative spirit, with a small population, much resources, and no limits other than those they impose on themselves, they decide: \"Why not colonize other planets? We can convert them into agricultural strongholds, thus increasing our potential population size, and allowing us to discontinue these annoying and freedom-limiting population control policies.\"So they practice terraformation on one of the planets in their home system. The extra food production allows them to relax their population controls for a little while; but soon enough they're forced to reinstate them. They begin experimenting with high-velocity unmanned probes (>0.01c), and eventually start sending them out to nearby solar systems tentatively identified to have planets like their homeworld.(continued) ", " (continued from >>4640537)In order to convey large numbers of colonists from their homeworld to the other planet in their solar system, the one they've been terraforming, they build a number of very large space stations, designed to house people in comfort during transit. Once their probes finally arrive in other solar systems and confirm the discovery of homeworld-like planets, they convert these space stations for long-term generational travel, and send them off.Worlds colonized in new solar systems are largely isolated from the homeworld by the vast distances, long response times, and longer transit times. They spread one star at a time, slowly, as the need arises. They see no need to send out powerful radio signals into deep space; they see no need to construct massive structures like Dyson spheres: they are humble; they are practical; they survive.Such a civilization could last hundreds of thousands of years, even millions; but it would never put out sufficiently strong radio signals for us to detect it, even if they were in our own galaxy.>Take your \"light cone\" popsci and stick it right up your FUCKASS.Stay classy, /sci/.>Real scientists and intellectuals and mathematicians are here on /sci/.Like you, I'm guessing?

It \"fell\" to a lower potential energy thus gained kinetic energy. Similarly, the electron moves faster the further UP the E field it is. It also \"fell\" to a lower potential energy state and that energy became kinetic.So let's make sure this is clear:Do you understand that the proton is moving faster in the lower part of its orbit (because of the energy that came from the electric field)? Similarly, do you understand that the electron is moving faster in the *upper* part of its orbit?Now you have to understand that the B-field is deflecting the particle at a right angle to its velocity. The particle isn't just going to accelerate along the E-field forever. The B-field keeps turning it at a right angle, and the faster the particle is going, the stronger it is deflected (Force = q VxB, i.e. proportional to velocity). It will curl around eventually.

Suppose we have a container with a solution containing low concentrations of substances A and B, which only react when they are close to each other. a(t) and b(t) represent the amount of A and B in solution at time t. The chance that a molecule of A is close to a molecule of B at time t is proportional to a(t)b(t). The product C precipitates out of the solution as soon as it is formed. modeling this I've found the following system:where k is the rate at which A and B are reactingThe next question asks to design an experiment to determine an approximate value for the parameter.

This would mean that we would observe just as many electrons as positrons, which we don't.There may be huge volumes of antimatter somewhere in the Universe, to balance out the scare amount that we see around these parts.

This is why an outline drawing or sketch is sometimes more effective as art than an original color photograph. For example, a cartoonist may exaggerate certain facial features which are unique to the character and remove other forms which it shares such as skin tones.

", " It's the energy that something has by virtue of being placed in a potential field. Charge, for example, generates a scalar field called the potential: V(x,y,z). This means that at every point (x,y,z) in space, the potential has a particular value. If there's another charge present in this field, its potential energy is found by multiplying the value of the potential at its location by its charge. Similarly, mass generates a gravitational potential. The potential energy of a mass in a gravitational field is the potential multiplied by the mass.The potential energy of a lone electron has no meaning. You have to specify its potential energy with respect to some other mass or charge. ", " A potential energy is a form of energy susceptible to be released. For instance there is the usual example of a ball being launched vertically from the ground : as it gets higher and higher the speed of the ball and thus its kinetic energy diminishes, while its potential energy increase (it is getting to an area of higher potential in the gravitational potential field of the Earth). When its speed becomes 0, its kinetic energy becomes null while its potential energy is at its maximum (it is at its highest point in the potential field of the Earth), then its potential energy gets converted again into kinetic energy until it reaches the ground, where the ball comes to a stop releasing this time thermal energy. The ball still have a gravitational potential energy at that point, since there are still lower potentials below it, but the ground prevents the ball to release it. Though if you drilled a hole into the ground, the ball would be able to release a bigger part of its potential energy into kinetic energy.In the same way, an electron has a potential energy in a certain potential field (the electric potential field due to the electromagnetic field in this case, to which you could add the potential fields of other forces if these may not be neglected) , and depending on where it is located in this field the electron has a more or less high potential energy that it is susceptible to release. ", " >>4336424To give an intuitive example let's say your electron is initially at rest relatively to a reference frame, it is not moving. Then, you project the electron towards another electron at a high initial speed. As your electron gets closer to the other electron, the repulsive electric force starts acting on it and your electron's speed becomes lower and lower. When your electron's speed is 0, it is at its closest point to the other electron, and just like at the beginning your electron is not moving. Yet there is a fundamental difference between the two situations, as this time your electron starts moving on its own and is projected in the opposite direction. What we say happened, in physicists' jargon, is that when your electron got closer to the other one, it moved in the electric potential field generated by the other electron, getting to higher and higher potentials as it got closer to it. When your electron finally came to a stop, it was so close to the other electron that the force acting on it was tremendous, and so you saw your electron being projected in the opposite direction. A mathematical way to describe this is using something we call potential, so that when an object is said to have a potential energy, it will release it by moving to the area of least potential unless being prevented by another force. In essence, potential energy just really help you predict how the object is going to behave.

People always find this statement curious, but in classical mechanics you map a systems trajectory through phase space which is just the Cartesian product of a bunch of real number lines.

Packet switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark I at NPL in the UK, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols.

Even the unclassified research is funded by agencies like the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. Why is the US Department of Energy and Ames Laboratory so vigorously pursuing research with Quasi crystals? What is the DOE New Initiative in Surface and Interface Properties of Quasi crystals? A Quote from The DOE: \"Our goal is to understand, and facilitate exploitation of, the special properties of Quasi crystals. These properties include (but are not limited to) low thermal and electrical conductivity, high hardness, low friction, and good oxidation resistance.\" That's the unclassified part. What are Quasi crystals? In 1984 a paper was published which marked the discovery of quasi crystals--Two distinctly different metallic crystals joined symmetrically together. By 1986 several Top Secret advanced studies were going on funded by DARPA with leading scientists already working in the field. In classical crystallography a crystal is defined as a three dimensional periodic arrangement of atoms with translational periodicity along its three principal axes. Since Quasi crystals lose periodicity in at least one dimension, it is not possible to describe them in 3D-space as easily as normal crystal structures. Thus it becomes more difficult to find mathematical formalisms for the interpretation and analysis of diffraction data. After the 'official' discovery of Quasi crystals in 1984, a close resemblance was noted between the icosahedral quasi crystal and the 3D-Penrose pattern. ", " I think there's a general misconception here as to what the singularity really is.Take a look in the past 100 years of technological development. Seriously. That is fucking incredible.

Many believe it will be equivalent in severity to the rise of humans.If you just make an equivalent leap (completely disregarding exponential growth) from 1900 to now to now to 2100... that's fucking incomprehensible. So what if we did factor in exponential growth?

", " >>4288894Before quasicrystals were discovered in 1984 the British mathematician Roger Penrose devised a way to cover a plane in a nonperiodic fashion using two different types of tiles.The tiles are arranged in a way that they obey certain matching rules. This is called a 3D-Penrose Tiling, which is made up of rhombohedrons instead of the rhombi. A dozen years later, ?Penrose tiling' became the prototype of very powerful models explaining the structure of the Quasi crystals discovered in rapidly quenched metallic alloys. Fourteen years of quasi crystal research has established the existence of a wealth of stable and meta-stable Quasi crystals with five-, eight-, ten-, and twelve-fold symmetry, with strange structures and interesting properties. New tools had to be developed for the study and description of these extraordinary materials. I've discovered that the classified research has shown that Quasi crystals are promising candidates for high energy storage materials, metal matrix components, thermal barriers, exotic coatings, infrared sensors, high power laser applications, and electro magnetics. Some high strength alloys and surgical tools are already on the market. One of the stories I was told more than once was that one of the crystal pairs used in the propulsion as a Hydrogen Crystal. Until recently, creating a Hydrogen crystal was beyond the reach of our scientific capabilities. That has now changed. In one Top Secret Black Program, under the DOE, a method to produce hydrogen crystals was discovered, then manufacturing began in 1994.
