From emotional traumas to personal victories you don't even remember, to education, the support of others around you, and naturally the basics like whether you had a happy home and neighborhood or not.These factors create your persona, from your motives to your methods, producing your entire thought patterns.

The neutrons produced by the fusion reaction increase the energy release by the fission reaction, which increases the temperature and pressure, increasing the rate of fusion reactions, making very efficient detonation possible.However, the secondary (and possible tertiary) charges in typical nuclear weapons use solid lithium deuteride fuel, and a considerable portion of the heat and pressure is generated by the energy released due to neutron transmutation of lithium into triitium and helium. This is rather un-starlike, with fusion fuel being both generated and heated to fusion conditions by neutron absorption reactions immediately before fusion occurs.In typical nuclear weapons, fusion is used more as a neutron source than an energy source.

", " >>6096572Well firstly, nicotine and caffeine ARE drugs and they ARE smart drugs and they ARE some of the best smart drugs on the market. Just because they're commonly used don't discount them, this is a terribly bad logical fallacy. Nicotine especially is a very good nootropic.Now, I've never taken adderall (never intend to, its shit-tier) but I've taken many different smart drugs. The three that stand out to me as the best ones are modafinil, aniracetam, and nicotine. I dose 200mg moda once on a usage day, 500mg aniracetam 1-3 times on a usage day and 4mg nicotine 1-8 times on a usage day. The problem with nicotine is that the effects are short lived and you develop tolerance (+addiction but that can actually be good, which I'll talk about below), so you have to avoid using it for more than a week or two in a row.Each of these drugs in its own right is a massive productivity increaser, modafinil is king when you're low on sleep and planning to be going for the next 15 hours, aniracetam wins out when you just need to get in a 4-5 hour study session. Nicotine is good to get a little dopamine boost that stops you getting bored while you study. Combining the three is the best, and I've found this turns me into an absolute fucking machine.You should be careful with modafinil as it puts much stress on the liver, absolutely no alcohol 24 hours either side of dosing, and avoid dosing for more than 2-3 days in a row. Aniracetam has no such concerns.As to using nicotine's addictive potential to improve your study habits, what I do is to dose nicotine if and only if I've been studying for an hour, then continue to study for at least an hour after dosing. You start to associate the high with study, and you'll find yourself more enthused about studying in general. Instead of thinking about doing other shit when you're studying you'll start to find yourself thinking about studying when you're doing other shit. Its a pretty substantial effect.Disclaimer: anecdotal. ", " >>6099423I liked to smoke a pipe occasionally when I was younger. It was a real rush.

", " >>6099473I definitely don't advise smoking as a way to get nicotine. People always seem to assume that nicotine implies smoking, but there are much more civilized ways to dose. I use these. But as you say, yes it gives you that rush of everything being better. Makes you more alert/smarter, happier, etc. Its a great drug. ", " Has anyone tried DS craze as a nootropic?

Everest, it's soemwhere nearer to 9.6 m/s^2.Once we integrate the equation we get for how gravity correlates with the height from earth, we actually get an average of about 10. When you're designing a structure or object that is affected by gravity, you don't go by your local gravity, you go by how it averages out, and you build your object from there (most people are going to be somewhere around 10).Your teacher probably gave you the value of 9.8 because she wants to make it relevant to your current location, and probably because it forces you to work with decimals (pretty important in high school).So, while early on it's good to use that value for your current location, your teacher is really shooting you in the foot because you're not memorizing the value of g that most engineers use (aeronautics engineers actually use a value closer to 9.2, because their limits of integration on the height-gravity function are slightly taller, and thus, it averages out to a lower value).I never understood why we don't use this value in our physics classes; this is like using the imperial system (miles, gallons, etc) in a other science classes. While it's good for a local use...the rest of the world gets shafted.Just use the value of 10 in your calculations, and if your teacher decides to have you use your local value, tell her you're only following proper engineer protocol.

I had this circuit with just a battery, LED, NPN transistor, and current-limiting resistor. I had heard that the value for the resistor isn't that important, so I started out with 1000 ohms, and everything worked fine. Eventually I tried a 1 ohm resistor and noticed the LED barely turned on. I went to pull out the resistor, but it burnt my finger fairly badly--like grabbing metal in a toaster oven bad. The transistor was ruined, but everything else was fine. So all this set me to asking a few questions I'm having a hard time answering... The actual voltage of the battery was about 8 volts, so according to ohm's law, the current drawn by this circuit was 8 amps: Current = 8 volts / 1 ohm. The LED was only rated for 60 milliamps, so why is it still working fine? 8 amps seems awfully high for a breadboard circuit. Furthermore, the power of this circuit was: (8 amps)^2 * 1 ohm = 64 watts! Considering the resistor is only rated for 1/2 watt, why didn't it fucking explode? Lastly, when you replace the resistor with just a piece of jumper wire, nothing happens, and nothing is damaged; but, all wire has some very small inherent resistance. Assuming the resistance is an arbitrary .0001 ohm, then by ohm's law, the amps and power would theoretically be insanely high: Current = 8 amps / .0001 ohm = 80,000 amps. Power = (80,000 amps)^2 * .0001 = 640,000 watts. But this would fry the transistor, but instead just nothing happens "}, "replies": [" Basically I'm asking if I'm using ohm's law correctly.

The LED only gets back a tiny drop and therefore a tiny current across it.Replacing the transistor with a short should burn the LED out if you do it correctly.

I never understood how true that is, until now.There are careers where, following standard operating procedures, you can press a button, lose the company a million dollars, and it's simply accepted as part of doing business. Academia is not one of those companies.Nothing is more pathetic than someone working so hard to scrape every last penny from a job that no-one interested in getting rich should have ever pursued in the first place. ", " Academic careers are then sorely beset by chance. When a young scientist or scholar comes to seek advice about habilitation the responsibility which one assumes in advising him is heavy indeed. If he is a Jew, one naturally tells him: lasciate ogni speranza [Canto III, line 9 of Dante\u2019s Inferno, sometimes translated as \"Abandon all hope\"]. But the others, too, must be asked with the utmost seriousness: \"Do you think that, year after year, you will be able to stand to see one mediocrity after another promoted over you, and still not become embittered and dejected?\" Of course, the answer is always: \"Naturally, I live only for my calling.\" But only in a very few cases have I found them able to undergo it without suffering spiritual damage.

That's 6-7 years making around 20k with no hope of a raise or bonus. You essentially live on a fixed income while getting a PhD. You live like someone who collects only social security for their retirement. It makes you think like an old retired person on a fixed income.All of this occurs *after* you've spent 4 years in undergraduate making nothing and probably getting into debt.10 years of living like this will have a strong impact on how one looks at money.If this person moves onto a 5-10 year postdoc they will be making about 30-40k per year. If they get married and have any kids they basically back where they were in graduate school as all the extra money will be sunk into their kid(s), paying off debt, mortgage and a few pennies into their IRA if they are lucky enough to have anything left over (probably not, likely they are running even more debt during this time).When they finally get a job as an assistant professor they are going to sink the extra 20k per year they get into paying off debt. Living like that for so long makes you hate to spend any money. Every dollar is painful to spend, it makes you anxious. You have to go over the expenditure again and again in your mind trying to make sure you didn't miss some way to avoid it. You are afraid you will regret the expenditure later.When this person finally gets to full professor that extra 20k is going into their retirement and their mortgage. They will be deathly afraid of not having anything for retirement because of the 15-20 years they spent in relative destitution and probably saving very little for retirement.

This will get you through introductory probability, basic point and interval estimation, ANOVA, regression, and nonparametric statistics. You can get an older edition dirt cheap.Once you get through that, if you're interested in getting more into the theory of probability and inference, you'll need multivariable calculus as I mentioned before. You can learn more about some applied methods at this point, but you won't be able to get too far without linear algebra.After you get caught up on the math, a great text for applied linear models is Kutner, et al. I love this book. For Introductory Math Stat, I like Bain & Engelhardt, but I know many people who hate this book. However, I'm not really familiar with any other books on the topic at this level.

We advised the first officer, commander Riker that sustaining a warp field around the ship would help shield us from the spacial disturbance.However, this disturbance seemed somewhat adverse to our scans. As the scans progressed, we noticed a shift in the gravimetric imprint of the warp field surrounding the class 5 probe. There was a large amount of feedback and the probe was destroyed. The explosion seemed to increase the magnitude of the spacial anomaly's effects and the warp field around the Enterprise collapsed.The Enterprise sustained minor damage to the port nacelle. In order to re-establish a stable warp field, I and commander Laforge reconfigured the mater-antimatter injection manifold. We also rerouted the primary EPS grid through the new bio-neural gel packs instead of the old isolinear sub-processors. This provided us with a significant power boost. As for the gravimetric disturbance, we attempted to collapse it by targeting a combined muon-baryon flux from the main deflector array but similar feedback occurred. The deflector will have to remain off-line for the time being due to the damage to the duotronic micro-controllers around the main emission relays.I am happy to report that our final attempt to collapse the anomaly has succeeded sir.

So the Earth's not a very good standard to base the metric system off of, and in any case it's not practical to measure every time you want to recalibrate something.So next, the meter was defined as the length of a meter-long platinum-iridium bar kept under vacuum in France. But this still wasn't accurate enough; it changed with thermal expansion and reaction to air.So they based it on fundamental constants- time, which was measured by the ticks of an atomic clock, and the speed of light. That precise number- 1/299,792,458 - was chosen because that number was one meter long- remember, the meter already existed and had a definition before it was defined based on light- but it could be measured more precisely because it was based on fundamental constants.Basically, the meter originally had a rational, round-number definition, but it was too imprecise and variable, so they chose a more precise definition that had the same length.

The definition of a function in A_n only requires the existence of _some_ point x with the given property. So once you have the sequence f_k, each may have a different x_k where the inequality holds. The trick is to also use compactness of [0,1], and pass to a subsequence where you may assume that x_k converges to some x.As for nowhere dense: Since A_n is closed, the converse would require that it contains some open subset of C([0,1]). In particular, there is some function f in A_n and an epsilon such that A_n contains the epsilon-neighbourhood of A_n. You can easily show that this is not true by writing down a continuous zic-zac-function of norm epsilon that starts like (2n+1)x and just goes up and down straight until the end. Add this to f and show that the resulting function cannot be in A_n by using triangle inequality.As for the last assertion: C(X) is a Banach space and therefore satisfies Baire's theorem, i.e. a countable union of closed and nowhere dense sets is nowhere dense. It follows that the union of all A_n is nowhere dense. But this union contains all functions that are differentiable in _some_ point. The rest is easy.

There is an \"exchange\" of \"virtual photons\" (virtual = unobservable) between electrons and electrons, electrons and positrons, etc. As a quasi-numerical example, two electrons interacting with the Maxwell field will raise the vacuum energy by an amount:where g and k are \"coupling constants\" which are to be determined by experiment, m is the mass of the virtual particles being exchanged (in this case photons), and r is roughly the separation between the two electrons. Since the mass of a photon is zero, this reduces to a simple V=g/r potential, which results in a repulsive force between the two electrons. (This is why Coulomb's Law is an inverse-square law - because the gradient of V=g/r is an inverse-square force).Similar interactions occur for the strong and weak nuclear force.

", " >>5636888i normally would ask a tutor or lecturer but in this particular subject i figured it would be better to ask online where i wouldnt get a weird look and a slow inching away from me haha ", " >>5636890Dont be afraid of being right either. Trust me, if you get into reasearch you'll spend a lot of time being wrong. Then one day you'll stand up at a seminar and make a statement that is the result of your data and all you'll hear is the now-discomforting silence of nobody having any reason your wrong, or any additional testing suggestions. Feels strange the first time. ", " >>5636893ask the lecturer. Student tutors wont give half a damn. Dont ask your peers, they dont know any better than you. Dont sweat doing too much research yourself either, you seem to have a pretty good knowledge base, but knowing too many specifics, especially in a field replete with unending specifics like genetics, will just clog up your brain. Stick to learning mechanisms and concepts, dont bother going out of your way specific shit like that \"haemattaglutin\" BS until it becomes you job to know that kind of stuff. ", " >>5636894Yeah its the dream to cure some horrible disease, something like T. Brucei that would let me die happy knowing that thousands of people are better off because of me. Im sure it did feel strange. what did you prove that got you the deafening silence of approval?>>5636898I try hard to learn the stuff, the problem is competing with other students that seem to be able to just absorb the information i have to look over a few times to get to sink in. Does the base mechanisms allow you to make a big discovery? whats your mojo when it comes to getting things to stay in your brain for good? ", " >>5636917First, not to dampen your spirits, but you should redefine your goals. Most researchers spend the majority of their life making minor discoveries related to behavior of genes or proteins, and then some happen to stumble onto something which leads to a larger discovery. You may start out with researching the fat cells of mice, and end up accidentally curing diabetes. Thats the way the world works. Only the very brightest of scientists, or those who have a great deal of society backing in the form of scholarships etc get to do world changing research right off the bat.you'll learn the specifics when you start living them. For now, learn the mechanisms so you'll be able to interpret the systems when they come to you. Engineers dont learn by studying engines and factor presses, they learn by studying the basics of how the components of these machines work (Newtonian physics). Same goes for every scientific discipline.No engineer learns the specifics of one brand of engine or one type of bridge, they learn the general mechanism so that they can apply them to understand all engines/bridges etc ", " >>5636927The dream has always seemed distant. But i guess everyone has to start somewhere right. i have still not even completed my degree and im slowly learning the how harsh the world or science really is. Do you know of anyone who works on something minor and then works on something else in their own time? i have always imagined myself doing something like that. ", " >>5636950Not sure what you mean by \"in their own time\". Its not like you can just up and do molecular genetics research on your own dime. ", " sort of expect your theoretical virus to wipe out large portions of all races at different rates>the future ", " >>5636952well that is true, but you can do all the theoretical side in your own time. I'm not sure where you work but in my university if you have the status you can go and use the sequencing machine so long as you pay for your own ddNTP's and dNTP's. maybe im naive and i need to learn these life lesons myself ", " >>5636964real research requires more than just sequencing. Trust me, a real research quality result requires real research quality funding (more or less). Im going to bed BTW, Ive got to get up in two hours and this isnt doing me any good. Glad I could help. Goodnight /sci/ ", " >>5636812The problem isn't so much the idea behind it, nor do i think it's difficult to make race specific diseases. The problem is that viruses mix, and if you make a very deadly virus it could mix with other more common viruses and the mix could then grow out of control killing all races. ", " >>5636963Thats why i suggested the use of race specific proteins as promotor inhibitors. but the whole mutation thing becomes a problem again, you could use some kind of Rec A mediated DNA repair mechanism... but lets just let the topic go i have already accepted that its just too complicated and thats enough to put my mind to rest knowing that i wont wake up to a biowar on a racial stage tomorrow haha ", " >>5636970thank you bro. have a good one. ", " >>5636812jew detected ", " Anyway, my idea would be to make a retrovirus that produces siRNAs that are targeted to silence some critical gene. The siRNA sequence is tailored to target the race that you want to eliminate. Although the virus would necessarily have to infect every human to spread, the virus itself is rather benign (like herpes). The virus would have to infect some important tissue (like the liver or kidney). So long as you are not affected by the RNA silencing, however, you should be fine.From a statistical standpoint, some \"collateral damage\" (i.e., killing your own race) might be acceptable so long as the virus does not pass itself in the germ line. For example, it's better to kill 95% of your enemy and 10% of your own kind than it is to kill 10% of your enemy and 0% of your own kind. ", " >>5636819This, and the race-specific gene (or genes) you'd be using as a target would have near-identical homologs in the 'master race', making the possibility of evolution and consequent cross-racial pathogen transfer extremely likely.

Can you please provide transcripts of Zecharia Sitchin's academic ancient language work? I would like to post this information on my website, and would gladly do so.2. Can you explain why Sitchin's work on Genesis 1:26-27 overlooks so many obvious grammatical indications that the word elohim in that passage refers to a single deity (as demonstrated on this website)?3. Can you explain why Zecharia Sitchin (or you in turn) have not included the comparative linguistic material from the Amarna texts that shows the Akkadian language also uses the plural word for \"gods\" to refer to a single deity or person (which of course undermines the argument that elohim must refer to a plurality of gods)? ", " >>5616355I like Ancient Aliens. I think it's fun to watch. I don't really take it seriously but I like the ideas presented. Some of them are neat. ", " >>56163594. Can you explain how the interpretation of the word \"nephilim\" as referring to \"people of the fiery rockets\" is at all viable in light of the rules of Hebrew morphology? In other words, can you bring forth a single ancient text where naphal has such a meaning?5. Can you produce a single text that says the Anunnaki come from the planet Nibiru - or that Nibiru is a planet beyond Pluto? I assert that there are no such texts, and challenge you and your readers to study the occurrences of \"Anunnaki\" right here on this website. Here is a video where I show readers how to conduct a search online at the Electronic Corpus of Sumerian Literature website. There are 182 occurrences of the divine name Anunnaki. Please show me any evidence from the Sumerian texts themselves that the Anunnaki have any connection to Nibiru or a 12th planet (or any planet).6. Can you explain why the alleged sun symbol on cylinder seal VA 243 is not the normal sun symbol or the symbol for the sun god Shamash?7. Can you explain why your god = planet equivalencies do not match the listings of such matching in cuneiform astronomical texts? I recently blogged on this issue and provided a recent scholarly article on the planets in Mesopotamian literature by experts in cuneiform as proof that Sitchin erred in this regard.8. Can you explain why many of Sitchin's word meanings / translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries, produced by Akkadian scribes?Thank you for taking the time to respond.

The standard proof requires a bit of a trick, but isn't too hard, and just requires a rewriting of the expression under the square root:  Hopefully you can proceed from here yourself. ", " >>5572817>How do I even begin that process?Practice. I found abstract algebra is a good place to learn how do to many types of proofs. It's a bit hard though. ", " >>5572817OP I think you need to over the basic properties of numbers as you seem to be missing things which are pretty obvious. You understand how things work, but you don't seem to understand how things work in terms of algebra.For that example all that's going on is, first you're saying that either all angles are equal, a<b=c, a=b<c, or a<b<c. These are all the possible combinations of the sizes of angles, if you understand that the letters are arbitrary.Then you can say that if a<=b then it follows that a<=(a+b)/2<=b. (proof of which is very easy).As b<=c and (a+b)/2<=b,(a+b)/2<=c.Which says that one angle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the other two angles.I'm just trying to explain the thinking behind the algebra. ", " >>5572821OK, ok, great. So it's OK for these things to take time. I've tried my luck on doing something more formal with another proof, this one taken from some lecture on proofs in Nottingham University.\"Prove that for every odd integer n, n^4 - 1 is divisible by 16.\"Here's what I got \"formally\" so far:Prove that for any odd integer n, n^4 - 1 is divisible by 16.Let n be an odd integer.n can be written as e + 1, where e is an even integer, 1 less than n.An even integer plus an even integer is an even integer.n^4 = (e + 1)^4 = e^4+4 e^3+6 e^2+4 e+1By the same token n^y - 1 where y is any positive integer is also even.Prove that e^4+4 e^3+6 e^2+4 e+1 - 1 is divisible by 16.e^p is even since any even integer plus another even integer is also an even integer.xe is even since any even integer plus another even integer is also an even integer.Therefore, e^4+4 e^3+6 e^2+4 e+1 - 1 is even.To be even is to be divisible by 2.16 is 2^4------And then I just can't go on. I've got the idea that since it's n^4, it HAS to be divisible by 16 because 16 is 2^4, but I just can't put it on paper. Do you see my general problem now?All that said and done, I'm growing a greater appreciation for proofs the more I do of them. ", " >>5572821I forgot to clarify that my intention was to more or less write down a proof as it should be written. You come up with a proof idea that sound solid, and then you try to algebraically (if it's an algebraic statement) write down an argument for the statement which you wish to prove. If your proof idea doesn't easily translate into formulas and equations, you might need to modify it slightly. Sometimes, even the best intuitive idea just isn't good enough, and you might have to approach the proof from a less obvious route (never underestimate a trick-rewriting).The intuition part you speak of is actually most useful when forming a proposition that you wish to prove. Many times, a statement can seem intuitively obvious, but when you try to prove it, you'll discover that there are lots of technicalities. Eventually, you'll have to overcome these problems, and in practice, half of the difficulty in proving something is to appreciate when to introduce new assumptions, and when new assumptions aren't necessary.For example, in the proof thatwhat would happen if both  and  were negative? Try it with , , say. And if only one of the numbers is negative, does the inequality even make sense? If ,  weren't given as an assumption, you would need to introduce it, because otherwise the statement doesn't hold, and your proof won't work. ", " >>5572857n^4 - 1 = (n^2 - 1)(n^2 + 1)= (n + 1)(n - 1)(n ^ 2 + 1)n^2 + 1 is divisible by 2n + 1 is divisible by 2n - 1 is divisible by 2As n is odd, it means that either n - 1 is divisible by 4, or n + 1 is divisible by 4. Thus, we have a product of a multiple of 4, a multiple of 2, and a multiple of 2, in independent terms. All together form a multiple of 16. ", " >>5572886Cool, thanks.>>5572872So basically I should just keep doing proofs? Is there some special way I should approach them or is it just intuition first, formality then? Do I just play around with the problem and variables until something clicks? I think what would be most helpful is if you could perhaps relate this in some way to problem solving, since that's something I'm fairly confident in. ", " >>5572857A common \"trick\" is to write an arbitrary odd number  aswhere  is some integer.With this, one hasYour approach is not worse than this in any way really, as the same thing can be read off what you wrote. But with this approach, you save yourself some verbal explaining, which is always nice.In general though, you can often save yourself some work by rewriting things.Finally, just to make those reading your proof happy (your professors, in this case), try adding some short explanations here and there, like:Because [...], it follows that[some equation/equations],which leads to[...],and therefore we have[...].This completes the proof. ", " >>5572495Oh no but that's EXACTLY the fundamental spirit of mathematics (others may disagree). You have the thought process right, I'd just recommend examining a few basic proof patterns to frame your arguments with.Ex. direct proof, negation, contrapositive, induction, etc. They all help with certain types of problems, and a lot of times if you know where to start, the rest just flows ", " >>5572857>Prove that for any odd integer n, n^4 - 1 is divisible by 16let , theneither  or  is even so  ", " >>5572509That's how little Gauss did it:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#AnecdotesNowadays you usally use mathematical induction:Proof that:Basis: and Inductive step:Show that if  holds, then also  holds ", " >>5572542>(a + b)/2 is greater than or equal to the square root of ab.Here I usually start with the given equation and try to get something already known.

They can be as easy or as hard as the instructor wants to make them.Vector calculus is very geometric, which requires visualizes curves and surfaces in space. The theorems are pretty deep, but seem really simple. It is the hardest of the three.Lin algebra is algebra and geometry together. The algebra part is basically a bag of tricks. There is always some trick to get the answer for an algebra question. The geometry part is fairly easy, because everything is straight lines and planes. It is disconcerting at first dealing with more than 3 dimensions, but everything is straight so it is actually pretty easy. The trick to this course is being able to switch back and forth from algebra mode to geometry mode. Some questions are easier in one mode than the the other, and sometimes you need to switch partway through your solution.Diff Eqs sucks. There are a few forms of differential equations that have analytical solutions. You memorize these. The rest of the course is algebraic manipulation to get the diff eq to be in one of these 4 forms.

Physics majors tend to take it after Ordinary Diff Eqs, but math majors also have other classes to take that they might take in between the three you brought up and PDEs (such as this Real Analysis class I've been harping on about--which may be split into two or more separate classes).Second semester physics isn't necessarily harder than first semester physics at all, depending on what you mean by \"second semester physics.\" If, as I assume, \"first semester\" is Mechanics and \"second semester\" is E&M, either one of them could be more challenging depending on what kind of intuition and experience you have. Both of them are \"see an equation and know how to use it\" or \"see a problem and know how to manipulate it so you can solve it\" (but that's every math-based thing ever), but if you have, say, a fair bit of practical Electronics experience (if you're a HAM, say), most of E&M will be a breeze, while there could be concepts in Mechanics that you can never quite remember the ins and outs of.

It does everything, but it does nothing particularly well. If you don't have the desire to learn several languages which are more suitable to specific types of tasks, then Python would be okay.You might also end up being exposed to Fortran, but if you already have another language under your belt, you can learn it in a day. Learning Fortran first is just going to expose you to a lot of bad habits.C/C++ are probably overkill. A lot of scientific work is being done in Java these days because of quick dev time, but that's probably outside your scope. Haskell and Racket are very pretty, but almost no one uses them, so they're probably a waste of your time.

Secondly, the solution of one problem need not affect the solution of another. It is wrong to assume a priori that problems with the NW, for instance, cannot be solved without intimate knowledge of NW (there is the question of why, if knowledge of previous progress is so helpful, the original authors couldn't progress farther than they have).I mean, I like Rosalind and I see that retracing footsteps of others ultimately teaches you something.
