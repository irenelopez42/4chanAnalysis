For instance blood pressure and cardiovascular disease are both tangible attributes that can be physically observed, measured and correlated to each other. On the other hand IQ doesn't have this tangiblility, yes you can show statistical evidence for its existence by devising numerous battery tests for sample populations but that's still not physically correlating IQ to a tangible attribute.There have been many proposals for the physical proof associated with IQ such as brain size, neural density, cortical density, grey matter or specific genes but nothing definitive yet. It also doesn't help that there is still no true assessment of what intelligence and for that matter consciousness actually is either. In truth the belief in IQ being legitimate is a \"cart before the horse\" scenario, instead of trying to definitively answer what intelligence/ consciousness is first we've jumped ahead to figuring out what the minimum and maximum parameters for it are.We've already seen what happens when you jump to focusing on the parameters without figuring out what the subject truly is. The mirror test incident with several species of ants and a 5cm fish being proven as \"self-aware\" showed this. Now the psychometrics community are torn as to how to proceed with self-awareness testing. ", " I know plenty of idiots that are creative in brilliant ways.

IQ is good at making predictions, it was designed to measure g factor, That's how science works, we create hypothesis and test it, IQ was designed as g factor predictor and was tested against reality, that's the point. Idk about diabetes, but IQ works no mater if you like this or not.>>11216180IQ is also backed by many studies, it gives results, that's the entire point. We don't understand gravity, yet we know mass attracts mass. Observing something and testing it over and over again doesn't require you to get mechanical explanation. I think I understand why there is so much denial about this, social implications of IQ are quite severe, but reality is what it is. Back in high school, and middle school, I did know kids who would study for hours, yet never be able to success to truly grasps topics at school. On the other hand there were kids who wouldn't study, who wouldn't study, who would go straight to video games after school or would party all time, yet still be able to get good grades. Sure studying is important, but different humans have different capabilities. I don't think it's that controversial, one of those differences is intelligence. When did existence of IQ as valid measurement been debunked. Few years ago discussion was pretty much only about of how much is heritable and how much is environmental or cultural. Is it because no one was able to prove that IQ variance between ethnic groups aren't manly genetics. It would be really nice to tell everyone, just study and you will get as far as you want, but I think anyone who had any kind of social interactions will know that it's not only about working hard, and we need to recognize that there are people who are genuinely trying and them failing is not their fault, and not fault of other people who are supposedly oppressing them.

The main products of the reaction are NADH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH2( flavin adenine dinucleotide). they are reduced versions of NAD and FAD (both with a plus) and they get reduced in the krebs cycle, they are whats called \"donors\" of H- and e-. The Krebs cycle runs on pyruvate which comes from glucose. ok but here's the important part. The NADH and FADH go to the mitochondrial double membrane and here is where the electron transport system. Few proteins called (simplifying) dehydrogenases and cytochromes are involved. what they do is they take the hydrogen and electron from NADH and FADH. The electron travels through some of these proteins (like an electrical current in a motor) to power the others (proton pumps) in order to pump hydrogen atoms (protons) across the inner membranes. This creates a hydrogen concentration gradient between inside of mitochondria (matrix) and the intermembranal spaces in order to transfer chemical energy from bonds into sort of potential energy. So the potential energy gets utilised in a specific protein channel in the membrane called ATP synthase. When hydrogen passes through it gives it energy (simplifying ) to attach phosphate into ADP and AMP (adenosine di and mono phosphate) storing that energy in this highly energetic chemical bond. This allows everything multicellular to live. ", " >>11209485>Educate me about Mitochondria.Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell.

Particles have spin, this causes their trajectory to be circular, they are confined to a trajectory, at rest only in appearance, but never truly. The inertia of a mass is set by the local gravitational field intensity, or fluid pressure of the local medium. As the local gravitational field intensity approaches zero, the circular path of trajectory widens. The energy, no longer confined, ceases to be mass, and becomes radiation. If you strip a mass of its inertia, it explodes into electromagnetic waves. ", " Special relativity states that inertia increases as the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. From this it follows that to decrease the inertia of an object, you just have to slow it down.

And there's two things that are preventing you from assuming a normal posture.1) The length of muscles. You need to spend long periods of time, at least 30 minutes daily, in a stretched position to grow sarcomeres or something like that. If you want your results to be easily maintained you need to spend a small minority of the time hunched over so the opposite muscles can shrink in length.2) Your nervous system. Your brain actually stops you from stretching your muscles too far to prevent injury. The way to correct this is the same as you'd fix muscle length, as you spend more time in extended positions, your brain moves the threshold. It's even faster if you load your muscles in these extended positions, which is how PNF stretching works.I don't know about hanging from a bar. But one time I put a piece of plywood on my bed and used my PC laying supine for long periods, nigger rigged on a monitor arm.

However with a bigger focus on Aviation but there's a big overlap and the company I work for does both.There's a big focus and push on materials science. In particular metal+carbon alloys and glass+ceramics+plastics that are lighter and stronger than aluminium.This has a couple of effects on the industry as a whole. It heavily reduces the weight of the vehicles but is extremely expensive to produce and usually proprietary/patented. There are dozens of different companies that all specialize in a certain material they own which are all used in combination by the bigger firms such as Boeing and Lockheed martin.This mixture of high cost but low weight results in transition towards smaller airplanes to reduce the amount of materials needed. But due to their lower weight and thus more efficient usage of fuel they can still traverse the entire globe.What will most likely happen is that big airport hubs will start to disappear as small planes will have the ability to take off from small airports in every country and arrive at every other airport.This lowers the cost of flying as well as making electric propulsion for airplanes possible.For military usage this could result in hypersonic missiles which can't be stopped by conventional anti-ballistic missile defence which is the current defence against ICBM nuclear weapons.This means that we'll have a new arms race which according to some has already started this month since China showed their new hypersonic missiles using this exact technology a couple of weeks ago. Starting the nuclear part of this new cold war.However companies like SpaceX have expressly refused this trend towards higher cost lighter materials by going with a steel design for their \"starship\" vehicle. Prefering to not pay royalties to these companies and instead compromising on weight cost instead. So it's unclear how the space part of aerospace will develop in the future.

I chose the problem of the mind, brain, and consciousness.

It's incredibly difficult to find people who \"get\" you, and 90% of the time they're neurotic, self-absorbed, or both. People think tangibly slower than you do. Most of the time, they're perfectly capable of coming to the same conclusions, just more slowly, but sometimes entire concepts are just impossible to convey because they draw upon so much from so many different places for just one step of an argument that has like a dozen steps, and you can think through it at lightspeed while everyone else is stuck on step one of part 1 and will never grasp the overall picture. So you try to be humble and assume that it's a failing on your own part that you can't break it down and translate it into something comprehensible, and usually that's true, but then you realize that not every concept has the courtesy to be comprehensible to them, and that some of them are even difficult for you, and that nobody out of a population of millions is going to be able to help you talk you through the tough ones, so you have to sit there frustrated and getting the faintest whiff of progress on the tough questions for years at a time. You see everyone around you getting manipulated and ripped off. Constantly. And you often don't see the point in calling it out because the people on your level are the ones doing it and nobody would believe you anyway. People turn to you when they need help and then go back to treating you like a fucking space alien the instant you finish. Or worse, they stop blowing smoke up your ass and start acting like you're an idiot the instant they disagree.

Understanding comes easy, and goes just as easily. So it never adds up to much (I started to really slow down in college when the classes began properly building upon each other).Overall, I would say that being smart is exactly the same as being normal, except that everyone around you feels a little stupid.

I know I can do this, and most people realize that I can do this after interacting with me. So it gives me an intimidating presence that freaks them out, and it always puts the burden on me to break the ice. People will also resent me and project things onto me, whatever their envy or resentment or insecurity requires to make me a villain to them when they feel they are exposed before my gaze. One bad habit I learned to deal with this uncomfortable reality is to make myself as pathetic as I can to people so maybe they won't be so intimidated, but all that does is scare them off even more. It is a constant struggle to be with people. Their hidden problems are way too obvious, and all their interests seem retarded, and I have to constantly hold my tongue or be avoidant if I can't figure out a way to deftly subvert these things with jokes. Cultivating a sense of humor has been one of my best strategies in general, and, honestly, I feel there is something transcendent about the sense of humor. Why do we laugh? It points towards something great and mystical.I will keep going on like this, mulling over aspects and complexities, until I divert my attention elsewhere. Partly because your question gets at one of the central themes and struggles of my life, but also because there is no way to turn my mind off.

Things along those lines.I instead am thinking of the /transition phase/: the \"singularity-point\" (we'll just abusively call it that for the sake of the thought experiment since it connotes the basic idea) at which there is a significant proportion of the human species which has a shot at biological immortality (or, very long life extension of meaningful long life), and the rest who don't.

Penrose / quantum mind is fringe, not well supported at all.http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/roger-penrose-on-why-consciousness-does-not-compute>The most damning critique has come from Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who calculated that any quantum effects within microtubules would break down after 100 quadrillionths of a second. \u201cFor my thoughts to correspond to a quantum computation, they\u2019d need to finish before decoherence kicked in, so I\u2019d need to be able to think fast enough to have 10,000,000,000,000 thoughts each second,\u201d Tegmark writes in his 2014 book Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality. \u201cPerhaps Roger Penrose can think that fast, but I sure can\u2019t.\u201dhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9907009v2.pdf>We find that the decoherence timescale s ( \u223c 10 \u221213 \u2212 10 \u221220 seconds) are typically much shorter than the relevant dynamical timescales ( \u223c 10 \u2212 3 \u2212 10 \u2212 1 seconds), both for regular neuron firing and for kink-like polarization excitations in microtubules. This conclusion disagrees with suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a quantum computer, and that quantum coherence is related to consciousness in a fundamental way.You are only allowed to honestly believe in \"quantum consciousness\" if you also believe consciousness has NOTHING to do with neuronal firing, because Tegmark established they will fire exactly the same way as predicted by classical physics regardless of any quantum effects that happens in proximity to them.

Quantum scale is extremely tiny.>inb4 someone brings up exceptions where normally quantum scale activity can become involved with other larger scale contexts(yes, I know, just pointing out the scale of macroscopic objects is nowhere close to what classical physics covers) ", " >>10910845Thanks for the info.My reasoning is a little bit different than Penrose\u2019 though. What I was saying is, since any process in the brain arises from the delicate and unpredictable interplay of molecules (as any other biological process), isn\u2019t it natural to think that the inherently uncertain outcome of this interplay, as its guided by the wave function, plays a fundamental role?

", " >>10910873So you\u2019re saying that we\u2019re already beyond that scale in ordinary biological processes? ", " >>10910884In almost all cases quantum effects aren't significantly impacting / determining biological behavior.You can find speculative examples of quantum effects having minor / trivial influences, and a lot of people really want quantum physics to matter for all sorts of subject matter it probably doesn't matter for because \"quantum\" has become a buzzword for vague, magical, futuristic supernatural stuff that make seemingly mysterious and poorly defined labels like \"consciousness\" seem to suddenly make sense (\"it's mysterious because it's not using normal physics!\"). But most of the time ordinary Newtonian physics is more than sufficient to account for what's going on. ", " >>10910907 I know what you\u2019re talking about. But how can you really say that classical mechanics suffices to describe the system? It\u2019s not like we have built a simulation of, say, a cell and seen that it works out anyway, so it would seem naive to rule it out as it definitely does play a role, albeit tiny, but many tiny changes could add up and get amplified with time in ways we\u2019re completely oblivious of. ", " >>10910948That's why someone did the work of showing it doesn't impact neuronal firing specifically.If you believe quantum effects matter then you have to bite the bullet and claim neuronal firing has nothing to do with cognition when everything we've seen to date has pointed towards neuronal firing being exactly what does matter for cognition.It's like if you tried to claim hypothetical quantum effects inside a power switch were important to whether a lamp was turned on or off and not just the power switch's location in the 'on' or 'off' position.For this to be true you would need to effectively claim the power switch can be in the 'off' position while the lamp is turned on because quantum effects were changing what the switch was doing to the lamp's end state.If instead the lamp's state is exactly the same in response to the power switch regardless of any quantum effects inside the power switch then that's the same as saying there are no quantum effects influencing the lamp's output behavior.

A linear combination of these neurons\u2019 activity predicts the animal's velocity and body curvature and is sufficient to infer its posture. This sparse linear model outperforms single neuron or PCA models at predicting behavior. Among neurons important for the prediction are well-known locomotory neurons, such as AVA, as well as neurons not traditionally associated with locomotion. We compare neural activity of the same animal during unrestrained movement and during immobilization and find large differences between brain-wide neural dynamics during real and fictive locomotion.>One Sentence Summary: C. elegans behavior is predicted from neural activity.You.can see how tightly the predictions based on simulated brain cells in the two right side graphs in the upper right of pic related match actual behavior. Quantum effects aren't influencing results in any significant way or else you would not be able to make such tight predictions of output behavior from brain cell modeling alone. ", " >>10908934Yes, in the sense that up until now all formalised computational tasks brains can do can be done by Turing machines and vice versa, modulo the required time and space resources.There are of course many important problems we haven't been able to formalise as a computational problem yet in which brains still dominate, such as natural language processing and image recoginition.

But their certifying your new speed, altitude and distance records would be very useful to you, in the propaganda needs of the day.One bit in their rules requires that a flight is not successful if the pilot does not land the aircraft.This posed a problem for things like >>10763106, as well as for the Soviets who for various reasons needed to use a system that saw the cosmonaut eject from capsule before landing and make a separate descent by parachute once re-entry was acheived.This is why the Soviet accounts of Gagarin's flight all initially claimed he had landed in the Vostok capsule. They continued to lie about that until it became clear that the world did not give a rat's-ass about whether the crew landed in the capsule, and that Gagarin's flight had been well (and rightly) accepted as the first manned space flight.

The issue is they are about as good as 1960s electronics. The other issue is that electromagnets don't work that well at these temperatures. Temperature increases the resistance of coil windings and makes magnets less powerful, so over all they are less efficient. We do have motors that work at these temperatures:https://honeybeerobotics.com/portfolio/hottech-venus-motor/The idea here is that the rover could use wind power directly to move the rover around. If we just make our rover so all it does to avoid obstacles is bump, reverse, and turn, we can completely eliminate the need for electrical actuators. Then we can have some simple solar powered(yes solar panels work at these temperatures!), electronics that do all the science and are just along for the ride. It's sort of hard to do the visual navigation because it's hard to make a digital camera with SiC electronics. NASA did have a competition to develop a mechanical camera that could take pictures with a single light detector. Pic related is what the challenge was. Make a camera with one rotating input that takes a picture with a single photodiode. You're only allowed to use op amp and three wires for output, or like two rotating mechanical outputs, you have to take the picture in less than 5 hours, you can use absolutely anything you want to reconstruct the image from signals.>>10764405silicon stops semiconducting above 300\u00b0C, but silicon carbide works fine ", " >>10763106Were they even do any testing on the Paracone?

At best it might even go around the planet and get with in range of the probe a couple of times, but they're probably going to need propulsion to keep it from drifting too far off. We know venus' winds probably circulate in the direction of the planets rotation at least at the cloud tops, but there's also the possibility that closer to the ground, where this thing's supposed to operate, they may circulate differently. We don't know much about the wind at this altitude cause far as we can tell there's not much shit in the air our satellites can look at and follow. Then there's receiving the beamed power itself.

Not exactly groundbreaking but knowing RF made it easier to understand concepts such as rain scatter and sea scatter, as well as what algorithms to use to reduce these. ", " >>10690048>radar system  i get why rain would produce noise but did they really have a problem with sea reflections? was this military or civilian? what frequency was this radar using?btw did you get to experience with passive radars (\"reading\" existing reflections from known sources like TV or radio stations or even other comercial radars) obviously this use much lower frequencies than regular radars but to my knowledge is the cutting edge for military (you dont emit a signal that could give you possition) ", " >>10690083*that could give away your possition, thats what I meant at the end. ", " >>10690083Mainly civilian but we also had the occasional defence project. Most maritime radars operate at 3 GHz and 10 GHz. The antenna aperture is wide but not tall so the emitted beam is like a fan: narrow in azimuth but wide in elevation. This gives good signals even in rough seas.The downside is that a substantial part of the beam goes down and hits the sea surface and is reflected back. Thus the reflections depend on the angle and therefore the distance from the antenna. Ideally one would do beam steering to keep the beam just off the sea surface but it seems people are not interested in this added complexity.I was not involved with passive radars but I know of these. I was interviewed for a job on this too, didn't get the job. You can use all sorts of frequencies from VHF and up. HF is a bit awkward since there is a lot of noise and also ionospheric effects. You can also use radar frequencies, one trick is to slave your system to an existing radar. I have also heard that you can use GPS signals which is very impressive given how weak these signals are. The advantage though is that the signals use Gold codes that give good resolution and that these signals operate 24/7. Since these always come from above it might see F-35 fighters with decent resolution.

This means that under the \"temporary\" degree plan, I need to take another 8 courses in topics I am not interested in what-so-ever which might mean another several years. On top of this, there is basically no advising and although I have about 2 pages of publications and several developed software packages accomplished in my time being here, these were completed either alone or with people from outside the program. My method for quitting is a little different than that of the girl in the video because, as it happens, I have a kid and I'm married, so \"just working on things I like instead\" isn't a viable option for me. First, I demanded my advisor give me an actual job that pays well enough -- seems like that is likely to happen as one of the grants we are working on renewed with even more money than last year. Second, I gave my department and the graduate school about as much shit as possible about this entire situation and they seem to have agreed to drop the number of classes I need to take to finish the PhD to 3-4, but this is still awaiting confirmation. This might give me an option to finish the PhD later, if I feel like it. Finally, because I don't trust my department or the grad school, I enrolled in an MS degree that is closer to what I want to do and I am going to make my department pay the tuition for it. Since my advisor can't afford to lose me on his grant, I have assurances the department won't cut bait with me. tl;dr Might quit my PhD because the department fucked me, but I'm determined to fuck them back and get what I want first.

Most intuitions that apply to light radiation apply to RF radiation as well. I insist, the only difference is the frequency, which affects how capable waves are to penetrate certain materials, how much the signal strength decays over distance, how they behave when they interact with borders, cavities, holes, etc.You can think about harvesting radio waves in a similar fashion as harvesting light waves. Radio waves, like light, radiate from a source with a given radiation pattern (i.e. how much does the source radiate in each direction). If a source radiates equally in all directions, it is called and isotropic source. The sun is an isotropic source. Some other sources are focused (they radiate more in certain directions). An example of this could be car lights.When you harvest light waves you typically use something like a solar panel. The solar panel is absorbing the energy over a given area. Because it is absorbing it, it is blocking the energy flow in the direction from the source to the back of the panel, creating a shadow. A similar thing would happen with radio waves being harvested by antenna arrays. If you surround an RF source with antenna arrays that absorb all the energy generated by the source you're basically creating the equivalent of a Dyson sphere. No radiation will go out.

The reason we see those particular frequencies and not others is just natural convenience. The radiation we receive from the sun happens to be rich in those frequencies. It's also rich in lower frequencies (e.g. infrared), but as those frequencies have lower energy it's harder for the biological sensors in our retinas to detect them.

We'll call him Prophet, because the first time I met him I could have sworn I was talking to the messiah. This guy is the PERFECT AMOG. He's not a muscled out meat head. He's not a loud and obnoxious \"friend\". He's not the good looking natural.He's a below average looking applied chemistry major who barely says a word. Yet AS SOON as he enters into a room, for some reason, ALL the attention goes to him. The room could be full of some of the greatest naturals, and as soon as he walks in they and all of the chicks they were gaming would IMMEDIATELY start qualifying themselves to him.This man has the strongest frame in the world. You can't tell a story in front of him without it turning into you qualifying yourself. I'll be talking to a girl, telling a funny anecdote, when all of the sudden:Me: And so there I was...Prophet: (from across the room) And then what?Girl: Yeah, and then what?Me: Surrounded by people looking at me with the greatest expression of awe...Prophet: Sounds funGirl: Yeah, Prophet's right, it sounds fun...Me: twitchYou can't tell a joke without him somehow getting \"credit\" for it by merely doing you the service of laughing at it.I was at a bonfire a few weeks ago with a big group of people. High value people too. Skin Industries models, dancers, etc. We're in the middle of having a crazy time when all of the sudden everyone's conversation stopped because Prophet brought up how cool it was that the soda cans were turning into aluminum oxide when he threw them into the fire. Everything stopped for a good 20 minutes while he talked about how awesome it was. This wasn't to chem majors. This was to Skin Industries models.... ", " >>10599369 The worst part is, he does this all subconsciously. I can't even really put my finger on what he does. He just steals ALL the attention in the room by sheer power of presence alone. Lucky for everyone, the guy's not a closer. He COULD be swimming in women, but it ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE WOMEN ARE BELOW HIM. Trippiest stuff ever.Anyway, so I OBVIOUSLY don't really like being in the same city as this guy, because he's INSANE to compete with. He won't pull, but if you are in the same room as the guy you are not getting any attention. Normally my strategy was to Amog as subtly as I possibly could, or just try to out-awesome him with self-amusement, but it never really worked. That changed when I went down to my mLTR's university over the weekend.I show up, see my mLTR, and give her a big hug.Me: \"You HAVE to hear about my trip down here...\"mLTR: \"Sweet, you can tell me and Prophet!\"Me: \"Alright!\" In my head: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!So I start telling the story, and AS SOON as I walk into the room it's somehow reframed as me qualifying myself to Prophet. It affects her too. At every punchline she looks to see if he's laughing. He is. With his implied permission, she laughs. ", " >>10599374 Try as I might, I fall deeper and deeper into his frame. By the end of two hours we are both sitting there listening to him make jokes about Edison's childhood and both laughing even though neither of us get it. Goddamn.

If I were in his shoes, I'd be on that girl so fast she wouldn't know what hit her.Me: \"Call her up.\"Prophet: \"Sure.\" (Man of few words, that asshole)Me: \"You're just saying that. Do it, I'll watch.\"Prophet: \"I don't even remember what she looks like.\"Me: \"I'm sure she was CRAZY HOT dude. CRAZY HOT.\"Attentions back to me now. I'm the one leading. I'm the one giving advice. He's the inexperienced one here. Score one for me.Later that night while my mLTR (I went down there for her, so I wasn't worried about my female options that night. I decided that I would learn as much about subtle Amogging as I possibly could) was showering before a big party, Prophet and I sat and chatted. I saw his frame grow a bit weaker as I sat and watched silly youtube videos with him. Anecdotes were shared. I was qualifying myself to him less and less in his frame. I was still IN his frame (there's no escape. His frame has the strength of a black hole.) no doubt, but not as deeply.We go to the party. I have fun opening sets, he has fun being the center of attention (as always). We get to talking. He starts going on about pressurizing the keg (which was broken, at this point). All eyes are on him as he speaks about how pressure works and how interesting this is (weirdest thing ever. Seeing 8's 9's and 10's get doughy eyed from a physics lecture). I, in my drunken state, have had enough of this. His frame is SUPER strong. These girls are looking at him like he's a GOD while he barely acknowledges them and lectures about PHYSICS at a FRAT PARTY. PHYSICS!!! I can't take it anymore... ", " >>10599376 Me: \"Prophet?\"Prophet: \"Yeah?\"Me (with a tiny little smirk): \"Shut the fuck up\"He gives me a look similar to one I'd give if I saw a little green man with seven eyes walk into my room and take my stuff. It was SO FAR outside his reality, SO FAR outside of anything that happened to him in his life, that something snapped inside of him.I held my eye contact. He shuts up. I start talking. He starts listening. Soon we're opening sets together. Self amusing together. Getting hyphy together.By the end of the night, we were the best of friends. I didn't do anything to the guy's frame. I just removed myself from it. I did something SO FAR outside of his reality that I just removed myself from it.Lessons learned:Amogging is not a matter of being loud or funny. This guy is neither.You can get a room full of girls doughy eyed and wanting to fuck your brains out by talking about hydraulic pressure.If someone has a strong frame (I mean GODLY), you HAVE to break through it. Anything you do will be inside their reality unless you do something so FAR from their reality that they have no choice but to look at you in a different light.Talked to my mLTR the next day.mLTR: \"Thank GOD!\"Me: \"Eh?\"mLTR: \"I'm glad you and prophet became friends. It was either that, or you guys were both going to become arch-enemies.\"Me: \"It was pretty close to the latter...\"mLTR: \"You should have seen you two together. Both of your personalities were amplified exponentially. All the eyes in the place were on the two of you. It was really cool. I've never seen anyone retain their individuality in front of him. But you two are such unique people, watching the both of you was like watching something historic happen...\" ", " >>10599380...\"That was a pretty cool little speech. It made me realize how far I've come. The guy is generally regarded as a God on Earth for some reason wherever he goes. People are constantly raving about how different this guy is.

Thanks guys.It was combative out of envy and the fact that in the months that I've known the guy, it's been impossible for me to maintain ANY semblance of frame around him. Basically out of the fact that every time the guy talked, his frame immediately took over. It's like when you play a videogame against a friend who repeatedly owns your ass.

You'd do your best to prove that you were above his \"bullshittery\". And then you'll find yourself qualifying yourself to him. Or you'll find that you're being totally ignored because you're the jerk that's trying to tool him. It's one of those \"seen to be believed\" things, but me and my mLTR joke about it all the time. The only people I've EVER seen hold their frame around him is the single GREATEST natural I know (I joke about how he's going to be president, and prophet's going to be the one pulling the strings behind him) and Prophet's best friend, who is on par with Prophet, but in a different way (the guy speaks like he's retarded, is below average looking, cracks jokes that don't make any sense at all, and is constantly surrounded by women...wtf?).

Does he act by those 25 (I believe) rules about body language?Reply With QuoteJust looked over them again. I've never seen the guy actively try and pick up a girl. So some of those points don't apply. All the ones that talk about body language hold true, but to such a crazy point of congruence its not even funny. However, he doesn't speak in a loose or relaxed tone. His tone is consistently a strange mix of a VERY businesslike vocabulary and tone, and his own strange language and quirks. He speaks with a HUGE vocabulary, excessive curse words, Ebonics, and valley-girl phrases.Thuriel, you've got it. This guy isn't a personality, he's a PRESENCE.As for the big frame eats small frame, I PRIDE myself on having a big frame. Before I ever even got into this stuff I was all about frame control (though I didn't really know what I was doing at the time). This guy has a frame the size of Jupiter... nothing stands in its path. Everyone else gets sucked into his reality so hardcore that if you fall outside his reality, you are IGNORED by everyone else.li0n, sorry, you don't got it.... The thing is that it comes from NOT TRYING (building, as you put it). I've never seen him TRY to do ANYTHING. The man just IS.Algeristo, you'll be hearing more of this guy. I got my car back, so I'll be going out more. Now that I can hold on to my frame in his presence, I think he'll make a few cameos in some FRs of mine.It's funny. My mLTR has just as much fun examining the social matrix as I do (reason number 267 she's my primary LTR), and she's constantly cracking up at the guy's sheer presence.

The entire place fell into his frame and started subconsciously emulating him...Wow, necro-post...Anyway, sure, why not?Since that night (it'd be about four months ago, maybe more) I've gotten to know the guy better. Not a lot better, but better nonetheless. He lives in San Diego (I live in LA, moving to SD in a month) so I don't see him often, but when I do, I gain more and more insight into him. Someone recently PMed me about this post, so I'll copy paste and elaborate a little bit more. PM in normal font, elaborations in bold. ", " >>10599393 I can, however, tell you more about him as I've gotten to know him a bit more. He's just the perfect example of someone who lives in his own reality. As such, sometimes people's RAS won't even go off about him (Brought him to a party in my social circle, no one paid him any attention (I'll say this. Their RAS's didn't go off around Prophet, but Prophets RAS didn't go off around them either. He just flat out acted like he was in an empty backyard. Barely even acknowledged anyone there)) and sometimes people will go crazy over him (the guy, once he starts talking, holds court like none other).Fact of the matter is, the guy has a few qualities that make him such an interesting person. First off, he's absolutely brilliant. He won federal funding to do science experiments with when he was fourteen. At the same age, he won what is tantamount to a Nobel Prize for under-eighteen year olds. Second off, he's a character. I went to a concert a few months ago with the guy. He pulled out a small vial from his pocket. \"What's that?\" I ask.\"100% pure ethanol. I stole it from the lab. It's basically 200 proof alcohol. We use it making bomb tests. I use it to get fucked up.\"He proceeds to drink the entire vial.\"Nothing feels better than getting fucked up off chemicals you stole from the state\".Needless to say, he's an interesting human being.Third, he's in his own reality, completely and 100%. If he doesn't like the track of conversation, he'll simply stop talking and zone out. If you say something to tool him, he doesn't even hear it/get it. If you say something he doesn't find funny, he gives you no courtesy laugh.All these combine to make someone who, at their best, Lords over parties with funny stories and a strange sense of humor that you can't help but be captivated by because you recognize his brilliance.\"His name was Patrick, the op said ", " The smartest man I ever met did not have an astounding iq, but he was capable of making some fairly astute observations about the way things are from a life spent watching.Sadly, he had a great deal of bad luck.

On first year I've joined a CS association to work on some interesting projects with like-minded people. Unfortunately 90% of projects was simple webdev/mobile stuff so I didn't do much there. However there was one guy who noticed my skills, he approached me and asked if I have anything to do during summer break. He told me he works on a gamedev company that really needs someone like me. I was interested so he opened Unity Editor, draw some penises, made them move around and told me \"you'll figure out the rest, make me a game with it\". So in few days I made a prototype 3d rocket-jump puzzle-platformer with Braid-like local time dilatation and sent it along CV to that company.I got unpaid internship, but became paid \"main server-side guy\" in a week because nobody there even knew anything about it. The whole place was a joke, it was like paid CS camp. The founder became millionaire because of pure luck and decided he wants to fulfill his dream to be .io games developer. He knew nothing about having a company and didn't allow any suggestions from us, so we were doing things like agar.io clone with memes for 9 months in 10-people team made up exclusively of developers, no artists, managers or designers. In other words we kept playing games, developing our own indie, studying and having fun.

My ex-teammate got a new job in a starting company and been telling me how chill it is, how everyone is cool and the boss is the biggest bro, etc, so I applied. I was supposed to have HR call, then interview with boss, then get a test/practice assignment which usually take 1-3 months for juniors, and then get final interview+code review. However there was a mistake, HR had no idea what she was doing and she sent me the assignment after first talk and told me to do before next interview. Unaware of this and without much experience in js, I learned react, webpack, Babel, ES6, etc and finished task in two days and presented it the following day. I got hired, instantly landed in a project with that ex-ex-teammate. It was doomed from the start, client company wasted most of the time, prepared millions for statutory penalty(?) but outsourced the project to us as last resort.The minimal viable product was literally shared dropbox folder. And we managed to do it, we met all requirements months before deadline. The boss have seen my potential and asked me to develop that framework to speed up further projects. He is great at marketing, keeps selling these ideas and I quickly develop prototypes for them.

Only now, having realized these concepts as being true of the real-world, and ones that any seeker of knowledge should know of (well technically I'm more into mysticism, and studying the nature of consciousness and so on, but realize that all knowledge of reality is valuable), have I now decided to go back into it all and learn it all over again. Man, is it difficult. Chemistry and physics were always my bane, and this is still true. It sucks too because my memory doesn't allow me to store much of it in my head, and so there's a very limited window before I have to go back and relearn it all again. How do I become an expert on these subjects, then? I don't know. I wish I could store an endless amount of knowledge of them in me.

I'm short on other chemicals, got some peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, copper, aluminum, tin, sodium hydroxide, some batteries (non lithium), iron, silver, ascorbic acid, and bleach. Also another question, something I've been working on figuring out are the following reactions from some experiments:Sodium bicarbonate is added to a solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide. To this solution copper is added. The copper dissolves, producing bubbles confirmed to be hydrogen by a flame test, and the reaction yields a blue solution. It's really slow, takes hours to days to get started and takes days to weeks to finish. Once the peroxide is used up, and the solution filtered, I'm left with that blue solution that will darken over time. If I add ascorbic acid, the copper is knocked out of solution. I can\u2019t quite figure out what\u2019s going on in this reaction. I\u2019ve found a good end point for the addition of ascorbic acid to be when the ascorbic acid starts to react with the excess sodium bicarbonate, leading me to conclude that the product making the solution blue has a very low solubility product. I\u2019ve concluded that perhaps the sodium bicarbonate is acting as a catalyst for the formation of sodium peroxide, which reacts with the copper to yield copper hydroxide. Do you think I\u2019m on the right track with my analysis? 1/2 ", " >>10546676The second reaction is me testing out NaOH as a base instead of sodium bicarbonate. My results were wildly different. To 150ml of ice cold 3% peroxide, 1g of NaOH is added. To this solution copper is added. Just like before, the reaction takes hours to start, but is probably slower to start due to the use of cold peroxide. This time, however, a small, steady stream of bubbles is seen coming off the copper. A flame test confirms this is hydrogen gas. MONTHS go by with a constant stream of bubbles coming from the copper with no color change to the solution. No evidence of the copper dissolving either. When the reaction finished I was left with small amounts of a white precipitate that I assume to be a hydrate of the sodium peroxide. I\u2019m completely stumped with this one. I have no idea what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve tried to figure out this reaction using all the usual methods but hit a wall when potentials for intermediate products are too high or low, no literature talking about this reaction at all (or any similar reactions in any degree of detail), and a lack of data on enthalpies of formation for the intermediate products.

It decomposes readily to form water and oxygen, and the rate of this decomposition is increased by presence of base. A test with a lit splint would confirm the presence of oxygen in a similar manner to hydrogen and can create a pop similar to the hydrogen flame test. It could be that is the gas which is evolving, as I can't think of a way hydrogen would evolve. ", " >>10546854to add to that, try testing the gas with a glowing splint (not fully lit) and see if it reignites. That would confirm oxygen. The squeeky pop test can show a pop for both hydrogen and oxygen but hydrogen is usually louder. It is still possible to confuse the two. ", " >>10546854>>10546861I\u2019ll definitely try that, though it\u2019ll take a while given the time scales, especially for the second reaction. I still believe it\u2019s something more than just H2O2 decomposition though. I did make control groups. One group was just copper in distilled water, then copper in a solution of NaHCO3, then copper in a solution of NaOH (0.167M), and one in just H2O2. The results are as follows after leaving my control groups alone for a month:Distilled Water = No reaction observedSodium Bicarbonate = light blue solution NaOH =No reaction observedPeroxide =The copper oxidized and turned blackThe copper in the NaOH/ peroxide solution did not turn black and remained shiny; again, no color change in the solution. About half the copper in the NaHCO3/ H2O2 solution dissolved and formed a dark azure solution. Another observation I forgot to mention:-When the peroxide is used up for the NaHCO3 solution, adding more peroxide turns the solution black, probably forming copper oxide. No bubbles are observed forming, and plastic wrap placed over the flask does not move, indicating no appreciable gas formation. -Bubbles formed in the NaOH/ H2O2 solution only came from the copper despite abundant nucleatiin sites in the flask. -I tried the NaHCO3/ H2O2 solution with silver and nickle and got the same results. ", " >>10547037Also I should mention that, unfortunately, my milligram scale broke and I was unable to get the masses of the metals before and after the reactions. Only got the mass of NaOH (after drying it in my oven for 3 hours at 110\u00b0C, don't have the equipment to do a proper titration unfortunately). ", " >>10547037So copper(0) metal in aqueous sodium carbonate solution forms a blue solution?That's kind of strange, as it would have to be oxidised to Cu(II) to form copper carbonate.

I cleaned it with citric acid and rinsed it in a separate bicarbonate solution to neutralize the acid and then rinsed it several times in distilled water. I'm fairly confident there wasn't any contamination. Perhaps the copper is oxidizing in the water, and that oxide is reacting with the bicarbonate very, very slowly? I know you can clean copper pennies in NaHCO3 if you let it sit long enough (something I've done before, and the oxide layer will react with it and turn the bicarbonate blue).Also the zinc was some zinc I bought online (99.7% pure), the silver was from bullion (99.999% pure). ", " >>10547248sorry not zinc, nickel ", " >>10547248Yeah maybe. I think copper will oxidise with atmospheric oxygen over time, and seeing as you've got quite a long timescale it could be feasible.You would expect the copper to form a black surface (copper oxide) as it oxidises which is probably what's happening in your peroxide only experiment (it could be the oxygen evolved from peroxide that accelerates this process). ", " >>10547302So overall I think your first reaction could be the oxidation of copper to copper oxide (just with atmospheric oxygen), which then dissolves bicarbonate in solution possibly to form basic copper carbonate. This would evolve carbon dioxide gas.

I'd say chuck an excess of HCl in there (relative to base) and see what happens. I'm doubtful that it's copper metal which is coming back out of solution, as that would suggest it is reducing back from Cu(II) to Cu(0) when you add ascorbic acid and I don't see how that could happen. I think the formation of basic copper carbonate is the most likely cause, as if we use the pathway you suggested (formation of copper hydroxide catalysed by sodium peroxide) then it should work with the NaOH solution as well.

The only thing is I'm not sure how well household vinegar will work, which is why I'd suggest HCl if you can. But yeah I'd think that's where you should go with your experiment.1) Test the gases evolved in the hydrogen peroxide experiments with a glowing splint to double check whether or not it's oxygen. This goes particularly for the NaOH/Peroxide copper experiment, as I think you could be seeing a copper oxide layer form which then catalyses peroxide decomposition, explaining the bubbles at the metal itself. 2) Try to determine whether you have basic copper carbonate in your sodium bicarbonate solutions by reacting with acid (ideally HCl) and observing for the evolution of CO2.

It would be quite difficult to test this way therefore. ", " >>10547996>>10547948Oh well, I still reckon copper carbonate is what you have in your first solution.

If it is copper oxide forming then it cam be reacting in alkaline solution to make a Cuprate salt, but then why this is happening for sodium bicarb solution and not NaOH in your experiments I am not sure. Well I've gotten myself confused now so fuckThanks to google though I think I may have part of an answerI've found this here https://wat.lewiscollard.com/archive/www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03822.htmwhich suggests that H+ released from the sodium bicarbonate could actually oxidise the copper metal. This would form your Cu(II) in solution while releasing H2 (two H+ are reduced to form hydrogen gas).This would be an incredibly slow reaction as bicarbonate has a high pH (low conc of H+), but I suppose your timescales are quite long so it makes sense.So that's what's happening I reckon.

This evolves hydrogen gas and forms Cu(II) ions. Oxygen might also be evolving from decomposition of peroxide. When you add the ascorbic acid this reduces the copper II ions back to copper metal which precipitates.The NaOH/Peroxide/Copper and NaOH/copper doesn't form the blue solution as there is no H+ released from the base to be reduced. There might still be oxidation of the copper to copper oxide (from atmospheric oxygen), and this would then catalyse hydrogen peroxide decomposition which is why you still see bubbling. The gas evolved in this solution should therefore be oxygen.Whether the hydrogen peroxide aids in oxidation of the copper I am not too sure. Seeing as the Hydrogen peroxide/copper solution turns the copper black while the distilled water control does not, I would say that it does. Maybe this is just because of the oxygen released from hydrogen peroxide decomposition (which in turn would be catalysed by CuO).

Sometimes when these thos try meditation they find themselves having more anxiety or other problems- that's because they have done self reflection and don't like what they see. Meditation is a destructive process. It's like peeling back the layers of an onion, stripping away the programs of the mind and seeing what's under the hood. Mindfulness is observational science, except the subject is your own thoughts and emotions. Don't expect it to be easy, meditating successfully is like going to the gym, you have to work at it and put in effort.

You wanna make friends and be social with other students, it makes a huge difference in your motivation levels when studying such a boring subject. But don't beat yourself over it if you are an introvert and find it difficult to socialize, you just gotta force yourself to actually spend time studying.2. When studying, keep it simple. Go over the books and after each concept, look away from the book and try to recall the information in your own words. Use a notebook for the most complex concepts which are difficult to explain just verbally.3. Don't memorize word for word, but also don't overthink it and try to find underlying reasons for everything. Accounting is a thousand years old practice, some things are the way they are just because of historical reasons. Why everything is the way it is will become clear with time.4. Make sure you are proficient in doing all the exercises and if you have access to old exams make sure you can complete all of them with no issues.5. You will need to go to all your classes and spend about 6 hours each day glued to the books. This does not include lectures, coffee and bathroom breaks, or browsing 4chan of course. Otherwise you absolutely will not make it. Don't be overconfident.Forcing yourself to do that is the most important thing.

They just renamed it and subdivided its types into distinct classifications. These are eg transverse myelitis, acute flaccid myelitis, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. It's caused by autoimmunity, weakened immune system, and toxic overload.I'm actually not even sure if polio is a real disease at this point, given that there's never been a wild polio virus isolated. The only time you find polio anywhere is in an animal displaying the signs of polio. For all we know polio is manufactured by another organism, or even our own body. That sounds like some whackjob shit to you because you still think vaccines got rid of polio, but that's the way it is when you realize the official narrative is wrong and have to now figure out how it really is.Hygiene has also changed quite a bit from the 50's.

I agree, the research is corroborated with evidence. However, there is no solid, undeniable, absolute evidence for carbon emissions linking global warming; right now its just a really good and grounded hypothesis. As well, conservatives are against punishing the use of fossil fuels through taxation. That is fundamentally against the principals of the conception of the US. People like myself who agree with global warming believe in incentivizing alternative energy consumption and expansion through reduced taxation. Instead of supporting the people making advances in the industry, the left wants to attack those who oppose it.

", " >>10368343>https://www.wired.co.uk/article/worm-brains>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_grams_experiment ", " >>10368389>>https://www.wired.co.uk/article/worm-brainsAside from your own implication that flatworms have souls ( you better be vegan), I\u2019m going to actually quote the authors of the paper.\u201cWe suggest that some trace of memory is stored in locations distributed beyond the brain (since the place conditioning association survives decapitation). A straightforward model implies that information acquired during training must be imprinted on the regenerating (na\u00efve) brain in order to result in the observed subsequent recall behavior. Future work must investigate the properties and mechanisms of such instructive interactions between remaining somatic organs and the regenerating CNS. However, two additional possibilities must be considered.First is the possibility that the memory is executed entirely by the peripheral nervous system, not involving the brain in learning or recall. Given the similarities between the planarian brain and that of higher animals (in terms of structure, biochemistry, and complex ethology (Nicolas et al., 2008; Oviedo and Levin, 2008; Rawls et al., 2011; Sarnat and Netsky, 1985)), and the fact that worms exhibit no behavior prior to the regrowth of the brain, it is most likely that the planarian brain indeed drives behavior. A pivotal role for the brain is also supported by the need for the Savings portion of the paradigm, and the complexity of the behavior that is very unlikely to be implemented by receptor sensitivity and reflex modifications only (e.g., Fig. 2P and Movie S1). However, if true, this would suggest a remarkable capacity for integration of complex information in the peripheral nervous system of an animal that normally has access to an efficient brain, and thus would suggest a research program into the untapped information- processing abilities of the PNS in other advanced organisms.\u201d ", " >>10368389Second is the possibility that the new brain is regenerated as a Tabula Rasa and is not imprinted by any traces of the previous memory. Instead, on this model the familiarized worms\u2019 PNS (which would have been modified and tuned, e.g., increased/decreased receptor sensitivity to a given stimuli during the training phase) is retraining the new brain: \u201cburning\u201d the association into the new CNS, during the short \u201cSaving\u201d session (which suffices because it is more efficient than in the unfamiliarized worms, due to the modified PNS sensitivity). We believe this scenario is less likely, because of the behavioral complexity of the learned task (Fig. 2P & Movie S1). Experimental and control worms were fed with liver during the entire procedure, and the liver odor would be everywhere in the dish \u2013 this means the worms did not have to rely on the rough texture to know that food was somewhere in the vicinity, and both the trained and control groups could have developed positive associations to the smell of the liver. As can be seen in Movie S1, the behavior does not resemble a simple reflex modification but rather the whole environment that makes trained worms initiate feeding sooner. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the modifications in the peripheral nervous system contribute to change in feeding latency.Not once do the authors of the paper propose a \u201csoul\u201d is responsible. If you\u2019re claiming that, make another study, cite that study, and show that souls are somehow the culpirate.

And although he did not give the exact date of the operation, Sabom reported that the procedure took place in August 1991. He later told us that he interviewed Reynolds for the first time on November 11, 1994 (Sabom, 1998). That left more than three years between the dates of Reynolds's NDE and Sabom's interview, plenty of time for memory distortions to have played a role in her report of the experience. So there is nothing remarkable about this particular observation.Second, there was her description of the bone saw. But the very observation that provided the greatest potential for supporting the notion that she actually left her body during her OBE actually tended to count against that hypothesis. As Sabom recounted,Pam's description of the bone saw having a \"groove at the top where the saw appeared to go into the handle\" was a bit puzzling. ... [T]he end of the bone saw has an overhanging edge that [viewed sideways] looks somewhat like a groove. However, it was not located \"where the saw appeared to go into the handle\" but at the other end.Why had this apparent discrepancy arisen in Pam's description? Of course, the first explanation is that she did not \"see\" the saw at all, but was describing it from her own best guess of what it would lookand sound like.

Pneumatic dental drills with the same shapes, and making similar sounds as the pneumatic saw used to cut her skull open, were in common use during the late 1970s and 1980s. Because she was born in 1956, a generation whose members almost invariably have many fillings, Pam Reynolds almost certainly had fillings or other dental work, and would have been very familiar with the dental drills. So the high frequency sound of the idling, air-driven motor of the pneumatic saw, together with the subsequent sensations of her skull being sawn open, would certainly have aroused imagery of apparatus similar to dental-drills in her mind when she finally recounted her remembered sensations. There is another aspect to her remembered sensations - Pam Reynolds may have seen, or heard of, these things before her operation. All these things indicate how she could give a reasonable description of the pneumatic saw after awakening and recovering the ability to speak.

Namely, she accurately recalled comments made by her cardiothoracic surgeon, \"Dr. Murray,\" about her \"veins and arteries being very small\" (Reynolds's words) (Sabom, 1998, p. 42). Two operative reports allow us to time this observation. First, in the head surgeon's report, Robert Spetzler noted that when he was cutting open Reynolds's skull, \"Dr. Murray performed bilateral femoral cut-downs for cannulation for cardiac bypass\" (Sabom, 1998, p. 185). So at about the same time that Spetzler was opening Reynolds's skull, Murray began accessing Reynolds's blood vessels so that they could be hooked up to the bypass machine that would cool her blood and ultimately bring her to standstill. Second, Murray's operative report noted that \"the right common femoral artery was quite small\" and thus could not be hooked up to the bypass machine. Consequently, Murray's report continued, \"bilateral groin cannulation would be necessary. This was discussed with Neurosurgery, as it would affect angio access postoperatively for arteriography\" (Sabom, 1998, p. 185).

The date range also seems a little curious, since most C14 labs report a date with a plus-or-minus margin of error, rather than a wide range. Perhaps a number of tests were done with different results, but Lines does not clarify this. Evidently preferring a date in the thousands of years, Lines asserted that the dating results provided \"graphic evidence that the handle has been contaminated by current organic substances.\" However, C14 labs have ways of minimizing modern carbon contamination, and it would not likely produce ages orders of magnitude in error.\u201dI do indeed agree that there\u2019s no evidence this test happened, but if it did, it doesn\u2019t line up with your claim that it\u2019s fossilized.>Are your grandparents as old as dinosaurs?Helfinstine and Roth, a source YOU cited, claimed that the wood actually appeared relatively recent, and I agree.

Entry-level jobs targeted at college graduates often offer a higher salary than those targeted at high school graduates. These positions are more likely to require specific skills, knowledge, or experience.[1] Most entry-level jobs offered to college graduates are full-time permanent positions and some offer more extensive graduate training programs.

Since the field is so wide, it's impossible to talk about all the mathematics you need to work on top of (and actually work on in the case of theory), so you should do yourself a favor and double major.

Take graph theory and combinatorics as well. Take all the heavy systems (architecture, OS, network protocol and engineering) classes and heavy theory (theory of computation, complexity theory, computational geometry, algorithmic game theory, etc).

", " >>10341988>Mathematics Requirements in Computer Science>While nearly all undergraduate programs in computer science include mathematics courses in their curricula, the full set of such requirements varies broadly by institution due to a number of factors. For example, whether or not a CS program is housed in a School of Engineering can directly influence the requirements for courses on calculus and/or differential equations, even if such courses include far more material in these areas than is generally needed for most CS majors. As a result, CS2013 only specifies mathematical requirements that we believe are directly relevant for the large majority of all CS undergraduates (for example, elements of set theory, logic, and discrete probability, among others). These mathematics requirements are specified in the Body of Knowledge primarily in the Discrete Structures Knowledge Area.>We recognize that general facility with mathematics is an important requirement for all CS students. Still, CS2013 distinguishes between the foundational mathematics that are likely to impact many parts of computer science\u2014and are included in the CS2013 Body of Knowledge\u2014from those that, while still important, may be most directly relevant to specific areas within computing. For example, an understanding of linear algebra plays a critical role in some areas of computing such as graphics and the analysis of graph algorithms. However, linear algebra would not necessarily be a requirement for all areas of computing (indeed, many high quality CS programs do not have an explicit linear algebra requirement). Similarly, while we do note a growing trend in the use of probability and statistics in computing and believe that this trend is likely to continue in the future, we still believe it is not necessary for all CS programs to require a full course in probability theory for all majors.http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendationsCS majors barely know precalculus.

While more and more regular white collars are enjoying the benefits of basic scripting, real coding has more or less stayed as something that needs to be a primary focus area for you to be any good at it. And blue collars have far less need of it than them.Now it's true that newer generation development platforms make programming ever easier, but the problem there is that comparatively speaking those \"easy to learn\" software will still be far removed from actual coding. They will always be simple and restricted, relatively speaking. Until they're not. And when we reach the point when they're not, the reason for it will be because we've created sufficiently advanced AI and robotics software to do such coding for you. Which means, again, that the actual coding will be done by real programmers (though at this point the minimum skill and ability requirement will be much higher than before), while everyone else will just learn to use those robotics software instead of learning any actual coding.tldr; I suspect that blue collar people will always be using some kind of a UI-backed software.
