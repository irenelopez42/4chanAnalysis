First a minor nitpick, the expressions themselves aren't called equations, as an equation has two sides and an equality symbol.Now, a *function* is actually defined by three things: A domain, a codomain and a rule that assigns each input to its output.When people write \"Let f(x)=x be a function\", they implicitly mean that f is a function from R to R (the real numbers)- of course, it can have other domains, but it's usually R in the context of algebra.The function g(x)=x(x+1)/(x+1), is NOT defined on the number -1 (as you said), so its domain is R\\{-1} (all real numbers besides -1).You can write x(x+1)/(x+1)=x, which means: whenever both functions f and g are defined, their values are equal. However, f and g are NOT the same function, as they don't have the same domain- g is not defined in x=-1 while 1 is.As another example, take f(x)=sqrt(x) and g(x)=sqrt(|x|). One can say that f(x)=g(x) on the positive real numbers. However, f and g are NOT the same function, as f is only defined for x>=0 while g is defined for all real numbers.

It's probably very likely that something even more powerful, like a collective consciousness (where we would be analagous to individual cells working together to create tissue) would eventually able to be achieved with the advancement of neural technologies (like being able to map the nervous system in its entirety and then running computer simulations to better understand how it works).

At high energies, the two fields are not looking that similar anymore.3.can your theory make more accurate predictions than GR?

It wants to go to the poles. It won't want to sit at the center or the very top or bottom.If we go back to the example of the equator, you can see that people can't hold their balance while they walk on the equator. They pivot between the poles so to speak.But if we take a paramagnetic material back to the magnet, we see it wants to go to the center and the very tip of both poles.Now if we go back to the equator, another larger paramagetic block or something, it should drop faster to the equator than it would off the equator.

People are intelligent, are intelligent generally so, and they have the capacity of empathy more so than other generally unintelligent people.

So, unless intelligent people find themselves in weird circumstances more than anyone else, then they muddle through them better than others, and therefore demonstrate more of this emotional intelligence.Secondly, its empirically testable. I dont know of any studies on your exact question, but one of the common criticisms of the IQ test and other tests is that they are culturally loaded. But its just not true, when they measure the cultural awareness of people you would think arent a part of that culture, smart people still demonstrate awareness.

Doing things. Not just recalling information, or having something in your experience. The point was this \"Emotional Intelligence\" isnt intelligence. If Emotional intelligence is just having a common experience with someone, its not intelligence. Now, if its actually being able to interact with someone of common experience vs not common experience, then it is intelligence, but I think the research shows its not limited by ones life experience. ", " >>9116727Would you consider the following as \"doing/being able to do mental things\": being able to detect if you are feeling an emotion, differentiating it from other emotions, designating it with a word, inferring how to conduct yourself when you take into account the emotion that you detected, observing expressions both verbal and bodily of another person and detecting, differentiating, designating and inferring how to conduct yourself in context of those emotions.If you do consider these \"mental operations\" then you have essentially argued for existence of emotional intelligence.Reminder:>doesnt warrant the term \"intelligence\", since it isnt a mental operation at all ", " >>9116065>There really arent many people who are highly empathetic but very dumb>Smart people can figure out other peoples emotions more so than dumb people, and smart people are more likely to care about the emotions of those more so than dumb people.this directly contradicts my experience that i just enlightened you about earlier. Most of the highly intelligent people i've encountered in my life were the individuals who struggled most socializing or interacting appropriately. And in the other section, not as intelligent people were much more effective or comfortable engaging socially , which according to my thesis is because the two different groups value different objectives, independence vs community, high grades vs high social status. I have to admit my emotional intelligence is premised with a moralistic viewpoint. While i said that any action, or combination of words can be used for a desired social outcome. the intention has to be for what is considered universally \"moral\". I do not consider psychopaths mimicking emotions and manipulating people emotionally intelligent. That is emotionally dishonest and immoral and detrimental to people and socially and personally and even they can get caught because it impossible to simulate sincerity. Humans have an innate inexplicable ability to catch what is authentic and what isn't in a person, some much better than others, which can change. Which i believe is rooted in intuition and consciousness/sub consciousness. I am not a cognitive psychologist yet so I have to admit this is all technically anecdotal, but all information technically is, its all observed from human behavior and happens to occur numerous times for other individuals performing the study. So a new key point is, its not just about using an effective interaction for a social outcome, it also has to have the correct moral prognosis>>9116077same thing for you, read above ", " >>9116768>high grades vs high social statusThat was discerned long time ago through 4 temperaments:Choleric - Extroverted with \"High grades focus\"Sanguine - Extroverted with \"Social status focus\"Melancholic - Introverted with \"High grades focus\"Phlegmatic - Introverted with \"Social status focus\"The order in which i presented these temperaments is in my opinion the generally the hierarchy of temperaments that experience success(Whatever success means for them) in life.Why? Because being introverted yet valuing social status is a recipe for disaster generally on the other hand extroverted and valuing \"grades\", for such a person there is almost no limit to how much success he will be able to attain. ", " >>9116727>The kind of thing measured by an IQ score.Except IQ doesnt measure intelligence ", " >>9116768>>9116675to add to my writing, intelligence to me is the capacity to deliberate then use your own conclusion to complete an objective. with emotional intelligence it gets much wider because there are many ways to achieve the correct objective (which again has to be moral). Like in mathematics, there is only one route to completing any problem. When it comes to objectives of human interaction the possibilities are endless, but again the action has to moral. Emotional intelligence in my opinion is not a matter of if you CAN act correctly, emotional intelligence is WILL you act correctly. So its not test based but CONSISTENCY based. This is not a matter of traditionally smart or dumb people. \"dumb\" people in my experience are less self concerned and have high awareness of community and serving others and do so because they value that instead of being independent. How many intelligent people know they should help the poor, do community service, aid their neighbor but instead choose not to, even not as intelligent people do this too. Its not a matter of intelligence, but an acceptance of the stimulated conscience, the acknowledgement of the need to lubricate social situations by amelioration or engagement for social pleasure. This is an open field of practice that is indiscriminate of both the intelligent and not as intelligent. This involves humility which is not a quantifiable practice but is recognized as humans as practically true. It's about acceptance and response. What each person is accepting to respond to varies amongst situations and relative to what the person know is moral to do in each situation for the betterment of the individual or society. ", " >>9116803You are confusing emotional intelligence with zealous habitual righteousness.Emotional intelligence is not being immediately compelled to act \"right\", whenever a trigger presents itself, to bring the state of the world closer to your concept of the ideal world. ", " >>9116789How do these categorizations account for change? How often is this test taken to review the consistency of the result? You know people are able to condition and prime themselves into transitions of a new person right? We also know there are countless examples of exceptions to the rule. This pseudo science does not even get implemented into any institution for filtration, neither does IQ. Do want to know why? Because they do not account for change. People ADAPT all the time. Either through AMBITION or STRESS. These categorizations and placement tests are redundant and problematic. Just give the individual the problem and method of solution or drop them in certain scenarios and they will learn to overcome and progress or they will reject any improvement and move on. This spectrum thinking highly ignores that the placement is dial which can be adjusted at any given moment in time. ", " >>9116811>zealous habitual righteousnessmorality is objectively true. This statement is a huge diving board which im not sure if you want to dive off now. Emotional intelligence from what I understand is equivalent to virtuous. Which is not a matter of logical thinking capacity but the consistency to respond to an empathetic inclination all humans have.ex: to sacrifice oneself for another person to live is naturally speaking the most illogical thing to do. But out of an innate calling within the psyche or \"spirit\" of a person, he understands this action is not only totally detrimental but supremely good. He overrides the contradiction to execute a virtue that most people cannot encompass. This can be learned, but it is inherently extremely difficult for both the highly intelligent and not very intelligent. This is an indiscriminate capacity every individual possesses ", " >>9116840this is me im going golfing now, ill reply later if you respond ", " >>9116840>ex: to sacrifice oneself for another person to live>the most illogical thing to doDepends on how you define \"logical\".If you use one of the informal definitions of logical, then its not necessarily true that saving someone through sacrifice is illogical, especially if you value that persons life over your own, like for example the life of your own child.

The reason was because they were useless, as most professors didn't show up, or gave an awful lecture. I also got my books only 2 months before the exams. I failed two classes in the first semester. One because it was hard and I figured I'd wait to take it a tad later. The other I messed up, didn't read the notes correctly and missed half the curiculum. It's just Gen Ed Chem, just a 3 days' worth. In the next semester, I failed 3, because of a few reasons. I had an ear infection for two weeks, and I had a fever for another one. The two weeks I came back home during Easter, my old physics teacher borrowed my books to make copies, but he forgot them and went to his mountain cottage, so I lost another 2 weeks. All in all, I lost about 1 month with sickness & the book situation. So I had about a month to study with my books, and another 1,5 months to study with stuff off the net. \"Semesters\" here are named like that, but are in reality about 4 months. I'm not making excuses since there were days I strolled around and did just 1 exercise, but I've had a few out-of-my-control stumbles as well.

The first article concludes \":Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons. Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or sexual intercourse. Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories. Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women.\" for the 10% incidence of detected microchimerism in nulligravid women. I find it significantly more likely for the former than the latter factors to result in the presence of dizygotic (i.e. not originating from unfertilized sperm) cells in women.The second article doesn't appear to be talking about nulligravid women at all, but rather the known exchange of cell lines between pregnant women and their children and qualifying it. Please note in your picture that most of the sample distribution is on the low concentration side (gEq/10^5 is 10^9/10^5 Eq ) and that fetal cells making it to the brain doesn't necessarily or likely entail future fetuses also receiving these cells. The last article is about flies. Nothing to suggest complex mechanisms in an insect are gonna translate to a vertebrate unless you have evidence to suggest so. In short, it seems doubtful that it occurs at all without fertilization and even when there has been a pregnancy and it exists, it doesn't mean your future child with hypothetical non-virgin woman is also gonna have them or be influenced in development by them from available evidence.

As (picture related) the study acknowledges, however, all of these dogs (n=9 !!!) had male littermates, which makes these the more likely sources of the microchimerism (i.e. the siblings, not the mother are the more likely source).

Even Darwin, as late as 1868, seriously discussed an alleged case of telegony: that of a mare mated to a zebra and subsequently to an Arabian stallion, by whom the mare produced a foal with faint stripes on his legs. The simple explanation for this result is that such stripes occur naturally in some breeds of horses.All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions. They do not stand up under experimental investigation and are incompatible with what is known about the mechanisms of heredity and about the remarkable and predictable properties of genetic materials. Nevertheless, some people still cling to these beliefs. Some animal breeders take telegony seriously and do not regard as purebred the individuals whose parents are admittedly \u201cpure\u201d but whose mothers had mated with males of other breeds. Soviet biologist and agronomist Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was able for close to a quarter of a century, roughly between 1938 and 1963, to make his special brand of Lamarckism the official creed in the Soviet Union and to suppress most of the teaching and research in orthodox genetics. He and his partisans published hundreds of articles and books allegedly proving their contentions, which effectively deny the achievements of biology for at least the preceding century.

But the damage can spread from this area to to the healthy cells via either free radicals from the destroyed cells or from good ole neural cascades which is basically the neurotransmitters from the destroyed cells spread and over stimulate other neurons until these healthy neurons die and their now free neurotransmitters continue the process leading to said cascade of neuronal death. There is also the issue of surrounding neurons dieing from lack of stimulation from the now killed neurons leading to those otherwise healthy functional neurons being pruned due to lack of stimulation. It's in this list of excess damage that functional neurology and neurosurgery are currently looking into how they can reduce these damages using various means.I know UCLA is looking into using ketones and other antioxidatives to reduce the free radical problem for instance. There's even been big success in rat models from making the rats fast for 24 hours after a concussion and the ketones they naturally produced spared a significant amount of brain tissue. There's honestly many compounds than in vitro are found to help in these other regards including the famous \"jellyfish protein\" prevagen.

It's akin to me doing a study on lemon usage and lung cancer and only choosing people for my study who used lemons their whole life and had symptoms of lung cancer then being surprised that the lemon eaters had lung cancer.Also>The condition is thought to affect around 15% to 20% of professional boxers.[citation needed]>[citation needed]>[citation fucking needed]More traditional studies on the disorder find much lower numbers and even still the fact that the symptoms of CTE is all post hoc means we are completely in the blind about what the disorder actually causes. It's a very tricky and unknown disorder and every time I hear someone say that heading a soccer ball or doing a soft tackle during just middle school and high school will give you CTE I want to physically hurt someone. Is it possible? Yes, but do we have any good evidence that it does? No, not at all. ", " Only Aussie cunts, British poms, and Mexican cholos care about boxing. ", " >>9005567I can think of a way.Boxing is mainly composed of small repeated brain damage over a long period of time. Small repeated neural damage is much less damaging than one large damage as the small injuries have a greater number of surrounding neurons to stimulate reconnections with each other preventing neural Darwinism and nearby neurons tend to be better able to take over functions from dead neurons than a much longer reconnection in which the neuronal environment is different. So function is restored and symptoms only last a few weeks to a few months after which the brain is able to compensate and the person experience no long term cognitive deficiencies.Now see what I said was technically correct but we have no way with knowing if that would actually work without real research on the area. But if were just going to spout random shit with nothing to back it up like you then hey it works good enough for me. ", " >>9005573>But that's the problem, [...]I understand what you're saying. You make a good point.>Case in point the NFL study you mentioned. [...]You're right, the article cited states it:>As such, many of the players who have donated their brains for testing suspected that they had the disease while still alive, leaving researchers with a skewed population to work with. ", " >>9004868once you physically damage your brain no pill will ever fix it.contact sports are for retards ", " >>9005609>Small repeated neural damage is much less damaging than one large damageThis is a tricky statement since it should depend on what is meant by small, large and how many times the damages is repeated.This article states the following:>Forty percent of those who tested positive were the offensive and defensive linemen who come into contact with one another on every play of a game, according to numbers shared by the brain bank with FRONTLINE. >That finding supports past research suggesting that it\u2019s the repeat, more minor head trauma that occurs regularly in football that may pose the greatest risk to players, as opposed to just the sometimes violent collisions that cause concussions.http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/ ", " >>9005611In that case I apologize, I assumed things based on my past arguments with people.>>9005620Absolutely, what I was saying was honestly just a quick little ramble against the anon as I don't like when an entire field of research is just boiled down to simple \"common sense\" statements. There are just so many factors and unknowns.But in reality I would argue the difference in damage between hits in a contact sport will not be great enough to severely affect the factors I mentioned in that post. In that, a very hard tackle versus a straight off the line tackle will still be causing around the same damage and one will not be the difference between successful reconnections. If it was a hard tackle versus a horrible car wreck then yes the factors I mentioned would come hugely into play. Instead total amounts of hits will probably be a much better predictor of total damage.

I've seen many people that load up their semester with difficult classes because they are \"smart enough\" to handle it, ironically they end up doing shit overall. Be smart and take it easy. Studying time is crucial too. You must set a schedule and abide by it, other wise you'll constantly be stressed trying to meet a deadline.

For my study habits:I tend to do my homework a few days before it's due, and I will review it the night before I turn it in. This helps in a couple of ways. It gives me time to ask the professor if something seems wrong or weird, and I am essentially studying the material while at the same time making sure all my answers are correct.Knowing the type of questions professors ask on exams helps tremendously too. This is something I think that most people overlook, but is something that has been extremely helpful for me. For example, do they like to ask two or three long-form questions on their tests, do they have true and false, is the material only stuff covered in class or on the homework, etc. If you can 'read' your professor, you can hone in on what's significant and cut out the crap.This is really all I've done to succeed in college. The only 'sit down with my textbook and notes' studying I do is the day before the test for maybe 3 hours or so. At that point, I'm just reinforcing the material or filling in the gaps for things that I may have not learned fully. The major I'm in requires essentially no memorization, so if you're doing something like biology this is probably a terrible studying strategy for you.And no, I don't pop addies (I don't even really drink coffee), my school is good, and I'm not a genius.

No work experience, no internships, while at DeVry, a school that isn't even accredited. I went to a decent state university, the best in my state, but still a public school, so nothing fancy. I graduated with a 3.5 and I haven't been able to find a job, or even an internship after 8 months and 500 job and internship applications. The difference between us? My friend is very social, and someone he met somewhere got him that job. He failed all of the screening tests, but he's a really likable guy, so they hired him over probably hundreds of candidates (since it was an entry level programming job). I'm a not a social person on the other hand. So to answer your question, it really doesn't matter whether you get Cs or As, unless you want to get into a prestigious graduate school, it's all about who you know, or meet. So don't be like me and socialize while you still can, and if you already do, don't sweat this off semester and try to do better in the future. 10 years from now it will all be meaningless.

So basically your friend got the drop on you the whole time and you don't even realize it.If the thing that stands out the most on your resume is a state school GPA of 3.5, you'll just get beat out by the boatloads of people with 4.0 GPAs, and at better schools.

It's not about doomsday, it's about a point at which even if we stop using fossil fuels completely, or stop warming of the atmosphere beyond a known threshold, such as ~400ppm CO2, that the system will move towards a new stability regardless. We have already passed that threshold by the way. The point is once you get on a path to changing the climate system on a global scale, it's virtually impossible to reverse the direction that climate is headed. You can cease all emissions, and it the CO2 that's already in the atmosphere and oceans will still contribute to warming. The real problem is the effects of global warming are amplified at the Earth's poles, especially in the arctic, which means that regardless of what we do we are likely to see a lot of glacial and ice sheet meltwater seeping into the Atlantic, causing global SLR and potential disruption of AMOC, something that has happened in past interglacials. This does not mean Greenland or Antarctica are going to melt overnight, it will still take centuries, if not thousands of years to completely melt the ice caps, if that even happens, but even a small portion of them melting has severe repercussions of human civilization, which is based in coastal regions. Then there is concerns about the positive feedbacks from increased global average temperatures due to such rapid (geologically) warming, such as trapped methane and CO2 deposits within permafrost, as well as methane clathrates on the ocean floors. There are actually quite a lot of reasons to be concerned about these impacts.

He said this guy could solve Putnam problems no one else in the department could solve, ones that even stumped other professors. He said you could give him any Putnam problem and he'd be guaranteed to solve it. Then he paused and said \"He became a terrible mathematician\" and laughed. I was dumbfounded and said \"What?!\" and the prof responded \"Until you or me he never had to beat his head against the wall while solving a problem. This guy never failed. He didn't know what failure felt like. When it came time to do research, this was the first time ever in his life he wasn't successful. He didn't know what failure felt like and just quit the PhD program entirely.\"At the time I remembered enough details on the guy to do a reverse google search and pretty sure I found him.
