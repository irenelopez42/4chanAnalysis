"}, "replies": [" >>13929364Depends on the country>USYou can get into one of many defense contractors of the military industrial complex>Anywhere elseLol ", " >>13929364The \"engineering is oversaturated\" meme is partially true. Partially. It's true that nowadays you can't expect to simply walk away from university with a degree in engineering, apply to a few companies, give the interviewer a firm handshake and get a nice job making 100k. An engineering degree on its own won't get you anywhere. We're not in the 50s.However, engineering jobs are still there, and some of them offer really nice prospects (good salary, benefits, career progression, et cetera). But just graduating (even if from a prestigious university) won't be enough for you. If you want to be a mechanical engineer, you must approach with seriousness the tasks of networking, acquiring multiple skills, getting good internships, acquiring experience, and such. If you get this right, you'll be okay.The issue with engineering is that the outsourcing of manufacturing shut many doors in the faces of average engineers who would have average manufacturing jobs. The career paths left are the ones that require very qualified (at least in theory) professionals, specially when low-end engineering jobs today are typically filled by engineers from countries such as India and Pakistan, who are more willing to receive low salaries than Europeans or Americans. tl;dr engineering is still good as long as you want to follow the 'high level' careers in the market. ", " >>13929364There is an oversaturation of engineering degrees, and an undersaturation of actual engineers.Actual engineering is learned by working under an actual engineer - id est, apprenticeship. The ability for people to actually learn actual engineering (or, for that matter, most any sort of skilled intellectual activity in general) has been greatly reduced by the 'interchangeable retards' human resources paradigm, which privileges credentialism, since it provides an easy excuse in cases of liability (id est, 'i can not be held responsible for hiring mister doopus, doctor of philosophy, who screwed the pooch, because he was simply the best qualified candidate'). ", " >>13929681> There is an oversaturation of engineering degrees, and an undersaturation of actual engineers.This. Most people who get engineering degrees are total fucking shitters who can\u2019t design a box. It\u2019s absolutely comical to watch someone get put into a design role only to see them panic when they can\u2019t hang and desperately scramble for a managerial or finance position. ", " Not really. Only retards can't get jobs. If you half way competent you are fine. I feel like most people get a engineering degree wanting to make money like its a business degree without enjoying it so they just end up being jobless retards complaining about Indians. Which to be fair they are taking their tier of retard work. If you enjoy engineering and its one of your interest worst case you are like me and get a trash job where you hate your life every day but make decent money. ", " >>13929364In any field from finance to CS there's an oversaturation of midwits. Profits and revenues are growing at every company year after year. Its just that the gains are being concentrated in fewer top people. ", " If u can\u2019t find a job in mechanical, there\u2019s always jobs in civil which u will Be over qualified for.

Worst comes to worst you can get cushy work in finance or something at BP or Deutsche Bank. I know people who were absolutely retarded and still found work quickly after getting their BEng.Germany is more competitive but there's a high demand for engineers still, and the pay is very good.No idea about the US but I would imagine it's more difficult since the degrees mean less.

I\u2019m defining herd immunity as an effective reproductive number (Re) below 1. That means that without any change, the virus will burn itself out on its own. Re is a function of basic reproductive number (R0; the infectiousness of the virus), and the proportion of people susceptible to infection (S).Re = R0 * Swhere S is further defined as a function of the proportion of the population that is vaccinated (X), and vaccine efficiency (Ve) such that:S = 1-X*VeFor the delta variant, R0 = ~5 and Ve is 0.8 for two doses of an mRNA vaccine. So all we need to do is solve for X:R0 * (1-X*Ve) < 1, which gives ~0.84. So in other words, with roughly 84 percent of the population twice vaccinated, the virus cannot spread exponentially anymore and infection rates die out.Now by applying a booster we bring Ve up to ~95 (i.e. comparable to the alpha variant), and solve for X again. This gives ~0.81. So a booster campaign that involves every single person who\u2019s also received the initial two doses only results in a reduction of the herd immunity threshold of 3%. It's a nice bonus, but it's rather on the low side. But as I mentioned, it\u2019s not the main purpose of boosters. By contrast, changing the X part of the equation (the proportion of people who remain not not yet twice vaccinated), has a much larger impact on Re (the rate of community transmission). This is the reason why scientists hammer on the importance of people getting vaccinated in the first place. A booster is good for staying protected for longer. The initial doses are what matter most for community transmission. ", " >is long covid a memeIt causes literal butthurt.

Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.>In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.

This abundance of free energy leads to more and more extreme weather with relatively small increases in temperature, but the average doesn't change much.

You estimate that on average, migrant caravans group up into, lets say, groups of 5000. So you design each section of the wall to be able to resist an assault of 5000 people. This works well for years, until suddenly, migrants start grouping up into teams of 10 to 20 thousand. Despite the overall amount of migrants being the same, individual sections of the wall break down and they come through. So, even though your wall should be able to handle the amount of people coming through as a whole, because of dynamic instabilities of the system, pressure build up at certain points and leads to cascading failure.

Even the best experts ultimately defer to tests based on the DSM criteria.You could look up specific screening tests/surveys, but even if you apply them fairly and even diagnose yourself with depression, and be 100% correct about it, it doesn't matter. If you don't have access to medical resources, a medical diagnosis does basically nothing, especially when the disease is usually treated with meds+therapy+fixing life \"choices\", only the last of which you can reliably do by yourself. In a lot of cases, it's just the docs trying to take the edge off and keep you from killing yourself until you eventually unfuck yourself.Unfortunately, most online resources concerning how to alter your life choices/way of thinking in specific ways are hit or miss. Not only are a lot resources not rooted in fact, but even the ones that are focused on either the generalized case, or the \"average\" case. The former are not usually written in a way easy for patients to digest, and from your perspective, it's probably not much different to a dozen random retards/family members saying, \"stop thinking so hard about how you appear to others\" or \"just stop being depressed lmao\" or some other usually useless shit. Some of it may apply to you, but you probably won't know which, and it's often impractical to try everything. The latter, \"average\" case is of little use to you, since you're not \"average\", in the same sense that no family has the average 2.3 children.All you can do is attempt to follow the usual, general, physical best practices like \"eat well\", \"exercise\", \"socialize and keep in touch with your family\", etc. The docs will tell you this anyway, in addition to any other treatment they give you. Then...tough it out. Hold out until either you get access to help, or until the problem resolves itself. ", " >>13763292I don't really know entirely. I have a good number of the symptoms of bipolar disorder, depression, and sociopathy, and some of the symptoms of paranoid and schizoid personality disorders. The issue I run into is that a lot of these \"symptoms\" are often for minor things in my life. For example: I often get impulses to treat other people poorly, or to just do whatever I feel like regardless of consequences. This is one of the symptoms of sociopathy, and it's coincidentally one of the aspects of my personality I make a strong attempt to put down. Is just thinking about doing bad things constantly a mental illness? If it never really amounts to anything, and is just on a small scale, and I put down those emotions almost every time, is it an illness or am I just an asshole by nature? This is the problem I struggle with, if I decide that it's too little to go off of, and that I'm perfectly fine, I might be writing off something that is only small now, but might get worse. If I decide that it's a full blown illness I might convince myself that I'm fucked in the head and that would change my behavior, and I could start justifying bad choices and making up excuses for my own failings, that and taking on traits that I don't and never had in the first place to suit my own view of myself as \"mentally ill\". People do this sort of thing all the time. ", " >>13766169Also, for reference, these sort of traits run in my family. My mother, grandmother, and both my sisters have most of the same shit that I have described in this post but worse, my brother is a felon, which I think should speak for itself considering that 56% of state prisoners, 45% of federal prisoners, and 64% of jail inmates have mental illnesses. My other brother seems to be the only mostly normal one out of us, but even then, he's got his colorful characteristics. ", " >>13766169Well, first of all I should clarify that I am not a mental health professional. I have never taken a psychology course even, but I have a passing interest in mental illnesses and I have tried to improve my self-diagnosis to present my problems more quickly to potential therapists. I am going to write a long ass reply, but the fact that you think you have both bipolar disorder and depression is already a sign that you are fucking up the diagnosis. You can't have both. Either you have the usual depression (called unipolar depression sometimes) or you have bipolar disorder and are currently going through a depressive period (called bipolar depression). The distinction is important because they have a different treatment. If you treat bipolar depression as if it were unipolar depression (with antidepressants basically) then there is the risk that the person will switch to the other extreme and develop mania or hypomania. With that in mind, here are some things that I have learned while trying to do a self-diagnosis-We are not experts, so we have to follow the DSM-5 carefully. I would suggest that you look it up and try to determine if you meet the criteria for the disorders you believe you have. The criteria are usually a minimum amount of symptoms, a minimum duration of those symptoms (i.e. 2 weeks for depression), distress and severe interference in different spheres of life. -There are usually several possible explanations for a single symptom. For example, if someone has problems concentrating, laypeople would think of ADHD, but it can also be caused by depression and by anxiety. Mood swings make people think of bipolar disorder, but they can also mean borderline personality disorder or atypical depression if I am not mistaken. Being withdrawn can be caused by fear of rejection, lack of interest or distrusting people. This process is called a differential diagnosis. You can look up the differential diagnosis of every disorder you think of. ", " Study behaviorism and probably kabbalah to understand both how linguistics and behavior work in tandem to produce the cause and effect social order that currently exists today. ", " >>13767055-Pretend that you don't know a damn about all the different mental illnesses and you have to learn about them from scratch. People have so many misconceptions about what depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD and OCD are for example that they might as well pretend they don't know a damn. Symptoms have to actually be severe and cause distress or interfere with your life. Smiling and crying 1 hour later is not bipolar disorder. Being tidy is not OCD. Feeling down for 3 days is not depression. Follow the DSM-5 criteria rigorously. -Avoid overdiagnosing yourself. Assume as little disorders as you need to explain your symptoms. If you worry a lot about social situations, but it turns out that you worry a lot about everything else as well and social situations are not particularly salient, then you don't have social anxiety (SAD) and generalized anxiety (GAD), only GAD. If you have problems concentrating, insomnia and depressed mood, chances are you only have depression and not ADHD, insomnia and depression. -Learn about the usual age of onset. If schizophrenia usually starts in adulthood but you believe you have it since you were 12, then you are probably wrong. Earlier onset is usually associated with a worse outcome. Also, if you believe you have autism or ADHD but never showed any symptoms when you were younger, you could be wrong. ", " >>13767102-It is not uncommon at all for a person with one disorder to have multiple disorders. This is called comorbidity. Some combinations are far more common than others. If you think that you have depression and anxiety, then you might very well be right (I believe the comorbidity between the two is 40-60%). On the other hand, I see an issue with your self-diagnosis of personality disorders. It is not uncommon to have more than one. However, the comorbidity between antisocial personality disorder (which you call sociopathy), schizoid and paranoid personality disorders is low (see pic related). I don't know a damn about those three personality disorders but the low comorbidity already makes me believe you are wrong. Check comorbidity rates to see if all your disorders actually come together often. -You need to make sure that you understand every key word in the DSM-5 right. My psychologist said I had obsessive compulsive traits and I found it hard to believe because perfectionism was a key trait and I didn't think I had it. I thought that perfectionism was about overworking so that everything looks great and I am a slacker. It turns out that perfectionism was about unrealistic standards that affect your self-esteem when you don't meet them and you can be a slacker, and I do have that. I didn't know what adherence to \"rules\" meant and thought I didn't have it, but it turns out that whenever you think \"I have to\" or \"I must\" you are implicitly adhering to a rule and I did that too. Make sure you understand such key concepts in the disorders you suspect (i.e. magical thinking, intrusive)-Just as you might overdiagnose yourself to confirm your thoughts about being abnormal, you could end up skipping a possible diagnosis because you don't like the label. My psychologist at some point suspected I might have autism and the idea that I could have legit autism made me go in denial. I imagine this is more common when you are diagnosed by someone else though. ", " >>13767172-Now, when it comes to normality vs abnormality, I struggle with this part as well. I would simply suggest to ignore whether a \"problem\" is uncommon and to just focus on the issues that it is causing you in your life. Does it cause significant distress? Is it something that you definitely feel like you should solve or are you for the most part okay with it? Also, is it interfering in important ways in spheres of your life (school, work, friendships, romantic relationships)? I'll give you an example. I believe I have social anxiety. There are several ways it has interfered with my life: I have failed labs because I feared making a fool of myself, I avoided giving presentations in school and got bad grades, I would go hungry because the idea of eating in a restaurant scared me, several girls got interested in me and told me so but I didn't do anything even though I liked them too because I was scared, I even failed a class among other things because the idea of taking a selfie was too hard. Those are several ways in which my fear of criticism and rejection has caused me problems. If you truly have a mental illness, then after some effort and analyzing your past you should be able to find instances where it has actually caused you problems, even if they are not as dramatic as mine. In the case of social anxiety for example, something like feeling miserable, frustrated and performing much worse in your job because of your anxiety in public speaking might be enough to qualify for the diagnosis.-Look up what it is like to live with a given mental disorder (like \"what is living with bipolar disorder like\"). You want to see examples of people that have actually got the diagnosis to see if they are similar to you. That also solves the problem of not knowing if your symptoms are severe enough to deserve a diagnosis -Look up a book about abnormal psychology (study of mental diseases). I found one called \"Abnormal Psychology, an integrative approach\" by Barlow.\" ", " >>13767409I think that you can already tell that reaching an accurate diagnosis is difficult. The advantange of working with a psychiatrist is that they can reach in an hour and with a good degree of confidence a diagnosis that would take you several weeks to reach with the same confidence.

Nature is culling them until optimum is reached in the genepool, not allowing them to runaway. Women are attracted to big manly hands instead of tiny monke hands for instance, but according to FRM there's no reason they are attracted to \"just the right size\" big manly hands.

The only environments where we see true runaway maladaptive selection are in environments like Island Tameness, where there is no strong selective pressure from predators. This is where the birds of paradise and shit come from. However, introduce a predator, and the entire shitty species is exterminated.Deers who select for bigger and bigger antlers get weeded out of the genepool and the females who don't care so much about ridiculous antlers have stronger offspring who survive. So the species of deer overall doesn't get retardedly big antlers. As an example. Fisherian runaway is the mathematical model that shows stupid female sexual preference ends up going extinct. It's not saying that the species as a whole has to go extinct. Just that over time the inferior sexual preference in the female goes extinct, unless there is no outside selective pressure.

Most species the females like smaller males.Even in human women, we can look at her genes and see which women will like males to be larger or smaller than her. Some women have genes that make them prefer men who are smaller than them. About 6% of women prefer men who are smaller than her. We are nearly finished mapping these genes. We are researching to take these genes and modify it into all women, so that all women prefer smaller men, so that we can engineer humans to have small men and big women.

Female's passing on their genes is not impacted if their son's ability to pass on genes is not impacted.>The only environments where we see true runaway maladaptive selection are in environments like Island Tameness, where there is no strong selective pressure from predatorsNo, peacocks are the most obvious example. They have tons of predators in their environments.

Peacocks also have elaborate colors on their huge feathers for instance, that wastes resources but has nothing to do with predators.

It fails in that if it were true, we'd expect to see many many many runaway traits because they don't get culled/go extinct, they remain according to the model. ", " >>13714887Below is just additional info meant for below first point I made, I typed it without realizing post limit but I didn't want to waste it.....there is also a lagging effect you seem to not take into account. The idea is they acquire the attraction genes to the negative trait and they pass on to the entire population before the male trait becomes optimal (and soon un-optimal). Thus the entire female population is stuck being attracted to that negative trait. If a female loses that attraction and has offspring with males of lesser size, her sons will be less attractive to the female population. Thus to individual females it's correlates negatively with offspring fitness to lose the attraction to oversized trait, so it remains among all females in the population.It's much like how we don't lose our appendix. If it gets smaller, it traps poo more, gets infected more, and we die more. So the genes for an appendix remain in the human genepool.

Many species of mushrooms with sclerotia can fruit without them, but some only fruit from the sclerotia so you should read up on the particular species you're growing.>5. can I produce larger sclerotia by spawning the mycelium to a bulk substrate and allowing it to colonize for several months without fruiting?I'm not sure what influences their size.

Please note I'm not trying to deboonk any of this I just need help understanding. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e2.htm?s_cid=mm7037e2_wI can understand how test-negative approaches have worked in principle in the past for people studying influenza vaccines: you have a large cohort of people who have been to a clinic or hospital for treatment for influenza-like illness (ILI). You test them all for influenza using pcr or w/e. Your positive test results are your cases and the negative test results are your controls. This works because a large number of people with ILI will test negative for influenza, as they are symptomatic for any other number of respiratory infections, so you end up with more controls than cases, and you can do some simple statistics based on the vaccination rates between your two groups and come up with some estimate of vaccine effectiveness.What I cannot for the life of me understand is how this approach is being applied to covid-19 infections/vaccines, such as in table 1 from this recent CDC report. They find that, of 6,960 unvaccinated people who were hospitalized for covid-19, 1,316 had a positive test result for the virus. Whereas of 7,676 unvaccinated people hospitalized for covid-19, only 235 had a positive test result. Which begs the question, if among these 14,636 combined total people hospitalized for covid, only 1,551 (10.5%) tested positive for the virus, what the fuck did the other 89.5% of people have if not covid? In the middle of a global pandemic with hundreds of thousands of people dying, among the people being hospitalized for presumed covid-19 infections, only 10 fucking percent actually test positive for the virus?

I feel like this can't just be the result of garbage data, I mean my first thought is that the PCR tests they are using have to be extremely poor to find that only ~10% of people hospitalized for covid-19 actually have the virus. But it can't just be the tests, since there is clear indications in their data that the number of positive tests in the vaccinated group is truly lower than the unvaccinated group, so there is definitely something there.But still what the fuck is going on that so many people are being hospitalized for the covid and yet testing negative for it?

Someone please help?Help with what? Are you asking how people test negative? Because tests are not perfect, because people that take test are not perfect, because it's too late or too early to get a proper sample from the certain sampling point the country uses for testing...Pretty much in every civilized country people are hospitalized based on symptoms not positive test.

Yes>Because tests are not perfect, because people that take test are not perfect, because it's too late or too early to get a proper sample from the certain sampling point the country uses for testing...No, the entire point of a test-negative approach to vaccine effectiveness is that they have to be TRUE negatives, not false negatives due to poor testing.

The number of tests failed because someone left machine on for too long or for too short, is probably irrelevant to number of tests failed because they were taken too early or too late.Whatever reasons is that PCR tests fail, it's applicable both to vaccinated and unvaccinated because there is no difference in testing these 2 groups, so your premise that it's meaningless is wrong.

I think that could be one way to make sense of the data. It's just surprising to me to see that 90% of the people hospitalized for covid-19 test negative for the virus, I feel like that is something that should be addressed somehow. If anything I assumed the tests were biased towards low specificity resulting in false positives, but it really depends what cycle threshhold they were using I guess. ", " >>13634203It still kind of begs the question in my mind, if we are saying some of these are true negatives (allowing for comparison between vaccinated vs unvaccinated), what the hell are these people being hospitalized for if not covid-19? Influenza maybe? All of the estimates for influenza I've seen have shown that the virus is hardly prevalent at all. Why are there so many vaccinated people being hospitalized with covid-like symptoms who are actually negative for the virus (more often then unvaccinated people), and what are they actually suffering from?

Despite more vaccinated than unvaccinated people being hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms, 'vaccine effectiveness' is claimed to be high just because a smaller proportion of them ends up yielding a positive PCR result? That's wild.Where does the data on hospitalization according to vaccination status come from? It would be very interesting to see data on all-cause morbidity/mortality by vaccination status. If COVID is a big deal and the vaccines are effective, we would expect hospitalizations for COVID-like illness to account for a substantial proportion of overall hospitalization, and the unvaccinated to make up a very disproportionate share of those hospitalized. But at least according to this data, from a time when less than half the population was fully vaccinated, there were about as many vaccinated as unvaccinated hospitalized for COVID-like illness, differences in PCR results notwithstanding. What about hospitalization rates for reasons other than COVID-like illness? Any vaxxchads brave enough to see what we may find there? ", " >>13634296The PCR cycle threshold is lower (stricter) for breakthrough cases in the USA, which might explain why a smaller proportion of the vaccinated with COVID-like symptoms test positive, but that doesn't seem to be the full story because it leaves unanswered the mystery of why, if 'vaccine effectiveness' as defined here is an artifact of different testing criteria, there is a difference between the different types of vaccines.Even if it turns out that the vaccines defeat the PCR test and not the virus, maybe the booster meme is still true and there is a difference between how well they do so and/or for how long?

I can't find a timeline for vaccination rate by age for the us, but it would have to be close to 100% to be compatible with the narrative about vaccine protection from severe disease, and it's not even close. And given that they're lying about the upsides of the vaccines, they're almost certainly lying about the downsides as well. But fortunately, this matte4 should be easy to settle based on data the CDC evidently possesses. So again, what is the all-cause morbidity/mortality by vaccination status? Why are we only seeing rates of COVID that don't even track with the rates of COVID-like illness? Let's be honest, if the raw data painted as rosy a picture of the vaccines as they they want us to believe, it would be blasted across every channel and not obfuscated by these definitional games. ", " >>13634101Brainlet here, I could be totally wrong but here's my understanding: once your body figures out the virus and you've got T-cells roaming around it doesn't take long to clear up a viral infection. Most of the symptoms of viruses are the downsides of immune response or recovering from the massive damage caused by both the infection and the purge. By then time you're hospitalized most people will already have killed the virus and are suffering from the after effect of the infection so there often won't be enough virus in your system to actually give a positive test.It is interesting that vaccinated patients test positive at higher rates though, especially with the much lower PCR cycle count. It could be that these vaccines reduce symptoms by slowing the immune response so it takes longer to clean up the infection? That would explain the high viral load in vaccinated hosts.

To the point that you can interpret the terminology of one theory as real phenomena in the other and viceversa. They both speak about the same ontological universe, but disagree on what should be called what.And even if your application of Occam's razor to dismiss LET were applicable, scientific theories do not exist in a vacuum.If all the mice you've ever seen in your life were black, you'd assume by Occam's razor that all mice are black. When you find a white mouse, your application of Occam's razor is invalidated, and you must admit that there exist mice that are not black.Or you can simply say, in bad faith, that these \"white mice\" are fundamentally different from, but very similar to, mice (which are all black), and that it's a common misunderstanding that \"white mice\" and mice have anything in common, stemming from the misnomer \"white mice\", thus saving face. ", " >>13576336The same happens all the time with SR. If the scientific institution had the integrity to admit it is wrong, the question of determinism in quantum mechanics would have settled right away the question of which between SR and LET to accept:Under LET there are NO problems in looking at quantum mechanics as a purely stochastic theory in a deterministic universe emerging from incomplete information. No quantum weirdness, no spooky action at a distance, no Schroedinger's cat, no superposition, no fundamental uncertainty principle. No dichotomy between momentum and position. No particle-wave duality. Only our incomplete knowledge of momentum and position.But because that undermines the Einsteinian notion of causality, which is derived and depending upon the speed of light being constant, thus stemming from SR, that cannot be true. Therefore QM must be nondeterministic and have twenty different, but all retarded, interpretations.This is putting the correctness of Einstein's postulate above the postulates of classical mechanics, of a deterministic and causal universe.And to reiterate: with Lorentzian causality, that is classical causality, QM can be a deterministic and classical theory.And before you come at me with \"muh spooky action at a distance\":Gravity has always been spooky action at a distance and will always be. Taking an effect, mapping it onto mathematical space, reifying space and calling the effect \"a cause\", as in GR, does not make actually the effect a cause.

In any case, I think it follows as a corollary that there can only be one speed of light, constant for all observers, because massless particles move along the geodesics which would be taken by massive objects with infinite kinetic energy. This is supported by experiment but fundamentally hinges on postulations to some degree.

This is semantic salad you're proffering in order to save your face. You're wrong.The best you can do is lend credence (different from corroboration) to the axiom by extending SR into GR and doubting that LET can do the same, but it can. And that same credence should absolutely crumble in the face of the aforementioned problem with QM.In any case, this thread is about the \"actual proof\" for the postulate. That means empirical evidence that conclusively forces us to accept it. There is none. The best you can do is to redefine terms to salvage \"empirical evidence that is ambivalent because it supports both a theory with the axiom, and a theory with its negation\" to \"empirical evidence for the axiom... as a part of the system\", Redefining words cannot turn inconclusive evidence into decisive evidence, the same way redefining space and time to be have properties and reifying them does not relieve the ontological burden to let you apply Occam's razor, and the same way reclassifying effects as causes does not transform effects into causes.And that is why OP wasn't informed by your inconclusive answers.

I'm not sure how the smell loss works. The explanation used to be that when the virus goes into your brain you lose the smell because of reasons, but a couple weeks ago I saw in the news that some damage to a thing in the face nerves is what causes it, according to some.

", " >>13388238Had Covid back in November, my smell is still a mess and taste is still affected as well ", " >>13385836About 4 days after onset of COVID symptoms I lost my sense of smell and taste over about 3 days. First smell, then taste. Loss of smell is normal with many infections, apparently due to inflammation of the nose/sinuses. Loss of taste is apparently a completely different mechanism - salty/sweet etc are detected by the taste buds, rather than the olfactory senses, so taste is lost due to neurological effects (either the taste buds themselves, or the pathway to the brain, or the brain).In my case, I had completely lost my sense of smell and taste for about 3 days, and recovered over the course of a week. By completely lost, I mean that there was no difference in experience between ice cream and tuna other than texture. In fact, I became hyper-aware of texture presumably due to the loss of the other senses, and began eating based on health and texture only. Flavour, salty/sweet/bitter/umami were completely lost. Notably, I could still feel the burning from spicy food, but it was completely devoid of flavour and somewhat dulled. My sense of taste recovered first, with the sense of smell recovering afterwards, both gradually. In total I had about 3 weeks of diminished senses. I have not noticed any lingering effects - both senses appear to be operating as before. I cook a lot, and the complete loss was short in duration, so I'm pretty confident that the recovery was full.During my infection I consumed a large amount of raw garlic and lemon juice every day, I took many vitamins, including zinc and vitamin D, and had a healthy diet and good rest. I was not vaccinated, and did not take any other treatments. ", " >>13389234There are anecdotal reports of Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, vaccination, SSRIs, zinc + azithromycin, and other COVID treatments alleviating long COVID symptoms, including the taste issues. There are also smell therapies as mentioned before, which uses strong concentrated aromas to help re-learn the sense of smell. Many people with loss of smell have found success with this method - it is similar to physical therapy, in that it attempts to forge new neural pathways to restore the previous function.It may very well restore itself within a month. But, personally, were I to be infected again, I would probably take Ivermectin with Zinc/Azithromycin. If you still have problems a month from now, consider the various treatments for COVID itself. To clarify taste/smell as they are often confused - taste is aromatic sense, the flavour of things. Taste is salty/bitter/sour/sweet/umami, and maybe some other basic sensations. When you have a cold the inflammation of your sinuses generally reduces your sense of smell - the inflammation physically blocks the olfactory sensors with surrounding inflamed tissue and mucous, but it does not affect your taste buds, or the neurological functions of taste. So, your chicken noodle soup 'tastes' less like chicken noodle soup, has less flavour, but tastes just as salty. One concerning thing about coronavirus is that this sense of taste impairment implies neurological damage. I'm personally looking into SSRIs for long covid symptoms, as that seems to be the most direct. The idea being that SSRIs (notably Fluvoxamine) reduce brain inflammation, and so might help with some of the symptoms - although again even the vaccines/ivermectin/etc have anecdotal reports of helping neurological long coronavirus symptoms. The whole long covid thing though is pretty nascent, and so nothing is really solid unfortunately.

Gaslighting.Gaslighting is a manipulative tactic that can be described in different variations of three words: \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen,\u201d \u201cYou imagined it,\u201d and \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Gaslighting is perhaps one of the most insidious manipulative tactics out there because it works to distort and erode your sense of reality; it eats away at your ability to trust yourself and inevitably disables you from feeling justified in calling out abuse and mistreatment.When a narcissist, sociopath or psychopath gaslights you, you may be prone to gaslighting yourself as a way to reconcile the cognitive dissonance that might arise. Two conflicting beliefs battle it out: is this person right or can I trust what I experienced? A manipulative person will convince you that the former is an inevitable truth while the latter is a sign of dysfunction on your end.In order to resist gaslighting, it\u2019s important to ground yourself in your own reality \u2013 sometimes writing things down as they happened, telling a friend or reiterating your experience to a support network can help to counteract the gaslighting effect. The power of having a validating community is that it can redirect you from the distorted reality of a malignant person and back to your own inner guidance.

I assume (after reading pubchem section on lidocaine) this is because the solubility of lidocaine is not sufficient to reach these concentrations without ionising it. on Pubchem it is stated that lidocaine solubility is 410mg/L in water at 30C so far off from the needed 20mg/mL used for injection. I've come across an article (PMC3383550) in which they add sodium bicarbonate to change the pH towards 7.4 however what I dont get is what would happen on a chemical level. at a pH of 7.4 ive read that about 25% of lidocaine is in nonionozed form but wouldn't this mean that the concentration at 5mg/mL nonionized start precipitating out of solution?

", " >>132706051. I think infinite decimals is bad notation filled with assumptions that are not always made explicit. My suggestion is to use simpler notation like fractions.2. Infinite decimal notation assumes that infinity is a valid concept. The ... at the end doesn't mean \"as many as you like\", it means \"infinitely many\". If you think infinity is an invalid concept, that's fine, but then that just mean that infinite decimals is an invalid notation.3. To get an number from decimal notation you add up all numbers associated with each digit times their \"positional factor\". For example, 123.45 is (1*100) + (2*10) + 3 + (4 * 0.1) + (5 * 0.01).4. It's the same thing for infinite decimals. The problem is that we can actually add all of the digits one at a time (since there are infinitely many of them). So we take the limit of the partial sums instead. So to calculate 0.999..., you have to calculate the limit of the sequence 0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... . This limit happens to be 1. 1 is the smallest number bigger than all of the numbers in that sequence.Note: THIS IS A DEFINITION!!! There is no \"proof\" that infinite sums are equal to the limit of their partial sums.We defined infinite sums as the limit of their partial sums.Just like there is no \"proof\" that 2 is the number that comes after 1.We defined 2 as the number that comes after 1.You might not like that definition, just like you might not like the definition of \"fruit\" that considers a tomato to be a fruit.But it's actually a nice definition with nice properties.If you add the limits of two sequences, it's going to be equal to the limit of the sequence you get by combining both sequences, so adding infinite decimals just happens to work in the way we expect.There are other nice properties like this, which make me think this is a useful/insightful definition.

The CDC had cited the 10% estimate to back up its recommendation that vaccinated individuals do away with masks in certain outdoor situations, but should keep wearing masks during others. According to the Times, the 10% benchmark is based \"partly on a misclassification\" of some virus transmission in Singapore at various construction sites that may have actually taken place in indoor settings. Singapore also classified settings that were a mix of indoors and outdoors as outdoors, including construction building sites, the outlet reported.

First it was weird things like \"does he really think the world needs more STEM grads\" or directly to me \"well you're going to be stuck behind a desk while I have adventures in the military\" etc. Basically all things I don't even recognise as insults, but mutual friends would tell me they were gossiping about.

When I got into a top gradschool it became \"lol, loser couldn't find a job and is still a student etc.\" Things like that, basically people who do not understand our world.Today I'm married to a beautiful postdoc, own a house in an upper class neighbourhood, earn more than any of them etc., but I have zero desire to let them know this. Also have even less desire to make amends, everyone does dumb shit in highschool, it is not my social responsibility to heal their emotional wounds and turn them into fully functioning adults or whatever. >tl;dr: Bullying appears to affect the victim intensely, so I would presume that most people who were bullied for any reason have some kind of revenge fantasty which does not even make sense to the bully ", " >>13220256I am at least 70% certain OP didn't even say that to her.

They willfully give away their information to governments and companies, they create echo chamber facebook groups. Where they perpetuate Flat earth and Anti vaccine ideology. Just like how capitalism doesn't value the best products but the most profitable ones, ideas aren't spread by how rational or advantageous they are but how memeable they are. When social stigma isn't applied, ideas exists soley on their own, irrespective of human desires and needs. The internet is a petri-dish for ideas where only the strongest ones survive. /Pol/ is probably the best example of this.But this Darwinistic like spreading of ideas is prevalent even when social stigma is present, it just works within the purview of what's socially acceptable. You can see this in action on Twitter at this very moment.Here are a few examples. >White people can't experience racism If you asked the average twitter user why this is the case, they wouldn't be able to tell you. They just know it's \"true\" because they've heard it and it's \"memeable\". >Astrology is more real than economics.

These twitter people haven't adopted their positions because it's rational, so they cannot be convinced to change their position with rationality. It's therefore common for them to hold ideas that have the same aesthetic appearance but who are actually contradictory. For example, a commonly contradiction is the idea that Gender is both real and not real. That Gender is not real because it's all socially constructed, that the norms that exist are just forced on by society, that in a perfect society without gender Males and Females would each be an even mix of femininity and masculinity. But if gender really isn't real, then trans people lose a lot of justification. Many transwomen don't feel that they're a \"Feminine Male\" they think of themselves as women, and that womanhood is very very real. ", " >>13171277>ideas aren't spread by how rational or advantageous they are but how memeable they areBullshit.

This petri dish phenomenon is what leads to the existence of fields of various sizes, some small, some huge (such as STEM, the humanities, cliques, etc.). People do think critically, it's just that they have different preferences. Most of these preferences and needs are superficial. This is why most men think of the perfect woman as being a silly caricature with huge ass, huge tits and supertight pussy that makes your dick go purple and die. No nuance.These memes or, to be more accurate, ideas or thought patterns occur even in science. You think it's possible to derive and understand entire fields? Nope, fields have now a mind of their own and people just trust other people and borrow ideas related to the scientific method, borrow mathematical folklore, tricks and methods, and so on.

But censorship is a weapon that can sometimes end up in the hands of woke trannies that cancel you and ruin your fucking life for observing that niggers hate whites, for example.

Even less so given that, as another anon pointed out, your aim is not to master everything in a pedagogical manner, but rather, to become familiar, gain experience, and master it over time through it's presence in higher levels (e.g: mastering Algebra and Trigonometry in Calculus, and mastering Calculus in Analysis). Also, do not opt (always) for the books which many claim have the easiest or best explanations. Sure, the ideas are more digestible, but there is also value in struggling to understand a text, figuring it out, only to find out you found a better way of explaining it which wasn't mentioned, or you found a shortcut of sorts or pattern.>Regarding learningThis goes without saying, but, follow along with pen and paper (it's more fancy), and make sure you understand what's being put forth to the point where you don't necessarily have it all under wraps, but rather, to a point where you can work with it, and you have the gist of it. Otherwise you might spend all day fixated on one topic, which surprisingly, has negative effects (see einstellung effect). At the end of each chapter (preferably), test yourself. >Regarding schedulingIf you are easily distracted, use the Pomodoro technique. If you aren't easily distracted, it's not necessary.

Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.

Approximately 5,000 9Be+ ions were stored in a cylindrical Penning trap and laser-cooled to below 250 mK. A resonant RF pulse was applied, which, if applied alone, would cause the entire ground-state population to migrate into an excited state. After the pulse was applied, the ions were monitored for photons emitted due to relaxation. The ion trap was then regularly \"measured\" by applying a sequence of ultraviolet pulses during the RF pulse. As expected, the ultraviolet pulses suppressed the evolution of the system...>In 2001, Mark G. Raizen and his group at the University of Texas at Austin observed the quantum Zeno effect for an unstable quantum system,[35] as originally proposed by Sudarshan and Misra.[1] They also observed an anti-Zeno effect. Ultracold sodium atoms were trapped in an accelerating optical lattice, and the loss due to tunneling was measured. The evolution was interrupted by reducing the acceleration...>In 2015, Mukund Vengalattore and his group at Cornell University demonstrated a quantum Zeno effect as the modulation of the rate of quantum tunnelling in an ultracold lattice gas by the intensity of light used to image the atoms.[36]>The quantum Zeno effect is used in commercial atomic magnetometers and naturally by birds' magnetic compass sensory mechanism (magnetoreception).[37]thoughts?

In particular, if the differential equation is linear, L{f} is just a rational function in s and the inverse Laplace transform can easily be computed.

Rearranging gives you H(s)=Y(s)/X(s).E.g. for the general second-order linear ODE:y''+a*y'+b*y = xThe Laplace transform (with initial conditions y(0)=y'(0)=0) converts this to:s^2*Y(s) + a*s*Y(s) + b*Y(s) = X(s)=> (s^2+a*s+b)Y(s)=X(s)=> H(s) = Y(s)/X(s) = 1/(s^2+a*s+b)The concept of a transfer function requires that the ODE be linear, i.e. a weighted sum of x(t), y(t) and their derivatives (the weights can be arbitrary functions of time). Equations involving non-linear functions of x or y (or their derivatives) aren't linear. IOW, if functions <x1,y1> and <x2,y2> satisfy the ODE, then so must <k*x1,k*y1> and <x1+x2,y1+y2>.

IQ tests, twin studies, transracial adoption, cranial volume, brain morphology, GWAS, racial admixture. Dog breeds, different species, human retards all show intelligence is genetic. Traits other than intelligence like skin color, athleticism are also genetic and differ racially.2. Consistent with all known biology, theory of evolution, human migration out of Africa, miscegenation rates. Founder, bottleneck effects, archaic admixture and isolation theoretically produce races/subspecies. PCA, K clustering, Fst for human genome all reproduce the classic race groups (subsaharan, caucasian, east asian, amerindian, australoid). Genes are expressed in brain tissue, brain function affects evolutionary fitness.3. Environment is proven irrelevant. Schools don't make all kids have the same intelligence, kids start out smart or stupid and stay that way, skip or get held back grades. Not only rich/healthy kids at good schools are smart, not only poor/sick kids at bad schools are stupid. East Asians are smart (and law abiding etc) everywhere they are in the world whatever the local racism level, Africans are stupid, criminal etc everywhere. In the US black kids are born smaller but grow faster than white, they aren't malnourished. Genes determine environment.4. Environmentalism depends on fallacies (Lewontin), fabrication (Gould), deplatforming (Watson), denial. Despite ease of race/environment controlled IQ tests they can't produce data showing no race differences.Against:Flynn effect. Only solid point supporting environmental effects, but doesn't show intelligence isn't genetic or racial. IQs rose from 1900-1980 presumably because of improved nutrition and health, but height increased the same way and height is mostly genetic with racial differences, and health/nutrition doesn't explain why US blacks can dominate pro sports but still underperform academically.

Pro-natalist doctrines like monogamy, sex for procreation, and rejection of homosexuality facilitates stable family formation which propagates the genes and ideas of the religious. Other commandments like don't murder and don't steal are also obviously useful for the successful functioning of a society. The idea that god is always watching serves as a panopticon effect, inhibiting crime when there is no effective law and order.

Has only happened to me twice, but it was a weird feeling where I was left like \"what just happened\", The other downside is the obvious stuff, like leverage, arm span, etc. I don't really view larger people as a threat, but do recognize that if they can get you intoa grappling situation or back you into a corner, they're at a definite and possibly devastating advantage.All and all, I was aware of \"small man syndrome\" in the case of men under 5 feet or so, but the whole manlet thing wasn't part of my awareness or experience until the internet. I've never really had any problem with women.

I'm also opposed to their cultural programs of pathologizing healthy behavior (as done by Adorno, Freud and many of their acolytes). The jews at the forefront of the recent cultural programs think the world will be better if it becomes more universal, more open borders, if we eliminate all distinctions. I think tribalism, nationalism is good. I also think the goyim nations have a right to forge their own destiny without the cultural direction of the jews.

But jews could just go to Israel. In the past, when Jews lived in Greece and Spain, they were given rights, but lived as sort of an outgroup. When muslims took over, the greeks and spaniards were terribly oppressed, but the jews still just lived as this outgroup, this 'other'. The spaniards and greeks were really angry, they felt like they had been betrayed by people who they gave rights to. The same thing has happened throughout europe and throughout history.When someone whose life and whose children's lives depend on their state, their people, prospering, or at least not collapsing, they make decisions with that in mind. They're less likely to start a busniess that enriches themselves to the detriment of the community, because they are a part of that community, and they depend on it. If someone lives as sort of an outsider, and would be perfectly happy if the state were taken over, or if it collapsed and they had to move on to a different state, they don't tend to weigh those factors into their decisions.At least that's my impression of where this all comes from. It's an ancient mistrust. Hopefully it will weaken as the jews have a homeland now, and they are seen as any other group. ", " >>12763812I don't care if its left or right, I just want it to stop.

Instead of solving the answers to tough problems with elegant formulas of nature, there was a tendency to collect a bunch of raw data, then crunch the numbers to come up with the formulas. Which is the best way in many respects, but the student loses some fundamental understanding of the process.Because of worldwide pandemic issues; many of you instructors are kinda scrambling to turn your ways of teaching into cyber lessons. I am selling my books as a resource from a slightly different way of teaching the subject. Most of the books have problems or exercises at the end of chapters. And half of those have the answers in the back of the book.As an additional perspective, I will sell about 12 advanced college textbooks from the early 50\u2019s that have been translated from Russian, used in Soviet cold war era universities.
