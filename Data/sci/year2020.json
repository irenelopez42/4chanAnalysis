Jinking (changing position at random, which I imagine is what you have in mind although you refuse to state anything whatsoever and just say \"nuh uh\" over and over and over again) and maintaining your posture (face towards enemy) are not mutually exclusive. Both would probably be maintained by simple algorithm. And despite what impressions you may have, there are very effective armor countermeasures to laser fire. You clearly love project rho so put down the chode and go root around there.2.) Depends on what your drive is, the size of your ship, what your armor is/what you're armoring against, and most importantly what your mission profile is. Armor for laser fire, point defense for missiles, maneuver for dumb hypervelocity, at least that's how I see it. Armoring against laser fire has less to do with how thick and dense your armor is and everything to do with its ability to thermally dissipate. So it takes the least mass to armor against while being the hardest to avoid, a no brainer. The larger your ship is, the less of its overall mass is contributed by armoring any amount of its surface area by definition. A chemical drive could leave you with much lower mass fraction, an NPP with much higher, and anywhere in between. And finally your mission profile, because your mass fraction is determined entirely by what kind of maneuver your ship has to be capable of. An attacking ship that has to transit into enemy airspace (spacespace?) has much more rigorous demands than one that waits to receive the enemy in orbit. A ship that lives in space has much reduced structural, throost, and dV requirements than one that lifts off.

The radiator alone will ask you to make big sacrifice to protect them, you will need to have engines visible, if the enemy manage to pierce down to one propellant tank your ship is dead unless you've sacrificed almost everything to also protect propellant tank from each other...etcSpace warfare may not even be possible.

By \"this\" I mean the following: corporations that voluntarily retain their worker's salaries so they (the workers) can pay less income tax. What I mean by this is:Suppose you got a worker that earns $1000 per month. His expenses are $100 for rent, $50 for groceries and $300 for other various stuff. After he gets paid, though, he needs to give away 10% of his monthly salary in income tax, thus another $100 go away and his total month expenses are $550. He saves the rest ($450.) Finally, after 12 months he will have $5400 saved up, tax-free money.Now imagine if corporations could act like some sort of bank, where workers could have money associated to them, and they could buy anything through the corporation thus the money never becomes an income to the worker until he decides to pull out. Following the past example the worker's monthly expenses would only be $450 because he is not paying income tax, and thus he saves up $550. After 12 months he will have $6600 associated to him, and when he decides to pull out that money (assuming that the yearly tax properly scales with the monthly tax) he will pay 10% income tax on that, leaving him with $5940 tax-free money.Meanwhile corporations could invest their employees' money on low risk investments, generating more revenue for the corporation.

", " >>12396162how late after the accident did your brain go retarded? ", " >>12396066Short version: Practice thinking.Longer version: Start by reading short stories. Don't use your mouth at all, have only your mind voice the words. The story's subject doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter if it's online or paper, only that you find it interesting and you're able to get through it in one sitting. If you need to start with a single page, start with a single page. There are two goals with this: to build up a mental voice, and to build a tolerance for what your mind considers tedium; to have it learn that there are rewards for sticking it out. Technically, it doesn't HAVE to be short stories, but it can't be anything that allows you to multitask, and it definitely can't be anything with spoken voices.Once you've built up a mental voice, start using it to comment on stuff. Doesn't matter what the \"stuff\" is - the weather, a cute girl, whatever. Start getting used to using that voice to explore.Slowly start building towards the \"why\" of your topics. Why, perhaps, do you think the weather is rainy, or sunny today? Why, exactly, do you find that girl hot? The point here is to build up your curiosity, so getting concrete, absolutely correct answers doesn't matter. Not that answers should be avoided, of course, just that exploration is the main point at this stage, and not fact checking.Eventually, apply that method of mental examination to your studies. It'll be easier if you find a particular area, or areas of your study interesting. Start with those topics. Work towards finding connections between what you're studying and what you already know.Play with your thoughts. Wandering, to a point, is a must.Especially at first, don't get too frustrated if you can't focus. Learn how to nudge your train of thought back to the subject at hand.Medicines are absolutely fine if your lack of focus is debilitating, but remember to occasionally practice \"sober.\"If you're feeling anxious, you're probably not learning.

You just know and have a feeling that they have a certain status that is higher than the other people. It's like that.

When I was in elementary school, we did arithmetic races where there was a bunch of simple addition/subtraction/multiplication problems on a sheet and you just do as many as possible. As a smart kid, I worked out how to do them in my head using something similar to what common core uses, but when I look at many common core problems the solution is either contrived or not the one I would use.For example, something like 12+19 may be recommended to be solved as carrying a 1 from the 12 to the 19 to make 11+20, or whatever other technique, but I literally just look at 12+19 and immediately think of 31, no intermediate steps, so this would piss me off and be slower. Other times I may just naturally use a different method.Number sense is good, but I think common core is just another development of the trend of schooling trying to cater to poor students and ending up with an even more convoluted mess.My suggestion would be to walk the kids through the algorithm, considering it is a bulletproof way of solving any problem, but suggest a few techniques that they can use as shortcuts if they get tired of writing out the problem each time.

It just stays as plastic, except getting broken up by mechanical forces until its microscopic, and then it is able to invade the biology of practically every living thing. This shit's in your water, maybe even in your bloodstream. We don't know what the long term affects of this will be. I see the potential for wood and bamboo based products, especially with regards to being able to massively cut out the wasteful and disgusting usage of plastics. Returning to materials made from things that grow would allow us to circularize our products. Once it is no longer needed for its intended purposes, it can return to the environment and be useful rather than destructive.Yet, as everyone is clearly aware, the demand for wood and such materials is already far too high for us to sustain, and certainly NO one argues that destroying forested areas is catastrophic. At the moment, pushing that demand higher would only make things worse.The only way we can survive long term is to move towards a circular economy which makes use of materials that can return to the environment, which plastics and other such things cannot do. I also think that a wood/plant based paradigm for products and materials would allow us to start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere if forests were being rebuilt, cut, and rebuilt again repeatedly.

A star that is stable on the main sequence for billions of years. Many stars do not fulfill this criteria, though billions of them do. K-type and G-type stars seem the most likely.2. A star that is bright enough to avoid tidal locking on its Goldilocks Zone. This rules out most red dwarfs. It's very unlikely there is life on tidally-locked worlds like those of the Trappist system. The window for the evolution of life on such worlds would be very narrow and basically limited to the terminator zone (permanent twilight zone between the ultrahot day hemisphere and the ultracold night hemisphere).3. A rocky or watery planet located on the Goldilocks Zone on such a system, able to support liquid water.4. The planet in question needs to have liquid water.5. If the planet in question is rocky, it definitively needs to have a breathable atmosphere of sorts to keep temperatures spread even and life possible.6. The atmosphere must have a low content of greenhouse gases to avoid a runaway greenhouse effect as in Venus.7. The planet in question needs to have the proper size, and thus the proper pressure to support liquid water. Too great pressure will only support ice. Too low pressure and it will only have vapour and ice.8. The planet in question needs to have magnetic shield strong enough so that it doesn't lose its atmosphere over the years.9. The planet in question needs to have an orbit with a very low eccentricity so as to not suffer from extreme \"seasons\", avoiding crust-melting summers and ice age winters. ", " >>1194174310. The planet in question needs to have some sort of fast rotation to create night and day cycles. If the rotation is too slow (such as Venus where one day lasts longer than one year), then the planet won't heat up evenly (again similar to the tidal locking problem above).11. The orbits in the solar system in question needs to be stable over billions of years.12. A large gaseous planet like Jupiter to shield the inner planets from asteroids would be very important. (This is the role Jupiter carries out in the Solar System)13. The building blocks of DNA combined on Earth's warm tidal pools. A disproportionately large moon, such as our own, on a stable orbit, is key to generate tidal effects and allow tidal pools to form. So that's 13 requirements Earth fulfills for life as we know it to exist on it. Show some appreciation for Mommy, she's a really special planet.

People with dyscalculia cannot recall addition or multiplication values and swap them back and forth in an algorithm without forgetting where they are in the algorithm or what they just had to recall. However, they usually don't have accompanying problems with spatial conservation or transformation in the same way or if they do it is because they never learned spatial problems because they were held back by problems of quantity. It is not related to dyslexia which is an interpretive disorder, but is related to dysgraphia which is also an expressive disorder. It is hard to diagnose in scientists because they learn to compensate, and the test contains arithmetic operations such as logarithms and different bases that most people don't remember anyway that allow those who compensated to still pass the test.

The week before Germany entered Poland to save the ethnic Germans from extermination, the Polish communist-controlled radio broadcasted calls to liquidate the Germans in Poland -- 60 000 Germans in Poland were killed that week alone. Poland had undergone a full mobilization on 30 August. She had been partially mobilized long before this. Jozef Beck's insufferable chauvinism and the Earl Of Halifax were principally to blame for the outbreak of the war. The Poles under Beck refused to even discuss Germany's very reasonable demands, which were the return of Danzig and the right to a super-highway across the corridor. Polish ambassadour Lipski was incensed and depressed at the actions and irrational behaviour and stubborness of his superior Beck.

However, many public health officials have warned that mass protests could lead to a reduction in social distancing behavior, spurring a resurgence of COVID-19. This study uses newly collected data on protests in 315 of the largest U.S. cities to estimate the impacts of mass protests on social distancing and COVID-19 case growth. Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non- protesters\u2019 behavior was substantially affected by urban protests. This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence. Furthermore, we find no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset. We conclude that predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.

Regarding fun\u00e7\u00f5es, I think some of the core concepts you must understand are:>being able to visualise the lines and curves just by reading the function in its algebraic form (like, lets say, imagining the graph of 2x^2 + 3x + 5)>understanding clearly how linear (1st degree) functions, 2nd degree functions and exponential functions work, being able to tell them apart, and understanding some fundamental concepts of each one of them>getting used to mathematical language and notation. Fuvest, specially, uses lots of conjuntos and other notations in problems, something you won't see in ENEM. Sometimes it might look scary, but don't be intimidated by notation. You can learn itRegarding to anal\u00edtica (I assume you mean geometria anal\u00edtica) and mechanics, you must first have a good understanding of math. You need a good understanding of functions and basic geometry to be able to deal with analytic geometry. You can mix up your studies of linear functions and analytic geometry. But then come the two most important things in physics and math:Solve problems and build intuition. There is a saying that states that mathematics is not a spectator sport. You can get pretty good at history or biology by reading a lot and watching lectures, but that isn't true for math and physics. You need to work on problem solving, that is the best way to learn these. The next thing, that I believe is criminally ignored by preparatory courses, is intuition. Instead of memorising lots of numbers and symbols, like in Torricelli's equation, you work on understanding what this equation means, what kind of movement is going on there, and where does this equation come from. More on next reply ", " >>11692546Some recommendations:3Blue1Brown - A great Youtube channel from a guy that explains math in a very visual and intuitive way. It's not like one of those descomplica lectures, he's more focused on explaining the intuition of things, but you should definitely check him out.Mathgurl - A good channel in Portuguese. She makes short videos talking about math, and they're good for chilling and getting more comfortable and sympathetic towards math.Khan Academy - Great auxiliary material for physics and math.Library Genesis - You can find any pdfs you want there.Physics Volume 1 by Randall Knight - It's a university-level textbook for Classical Mechanics, but it's pretty much the same kind of mechanics you'll see in Fuvest. I recommend it because it's my favourite physics textbook, and it offers much better explanations than regular high school and vestibular textbooks.I think that's it, but don't hesitate in asking more questions if you want.>>11692483Naval Engineering. I didn't use much physical material (I'd just download pdfs), but I still have some of my high school textbooks, although I left some in the locker and never came back to pick them up. You can have them, btw, if that's why you're asking. Although I don't think they're particularly great compared to any other hs textbooks. ", " >>11692553Oh, shit. I forgot WolframAlpha. It's a tool where you can just plug the equations in, and you get the roots, the graph, and anything else you might want.

FUVEST questions are not some ITA shit but usually they go a little deeper than ENEM. You gotta be strategic. Do tons of exercises, get the \"flavor\" the test generally goes for (what topics they are most consistently asking every year), learn to prioritize some questions over others and get good on time administration. If it makes you feel better math is what used to fuck up most people because you don't just read a bunch of facts and mark the correct one, it takes some time to solve, so by following what some anons are saying you will already be miles ahead of most people.Unfortunately Brazil turned vestibular into a sport so there will be a lot of pressure and ego in those cursinho's environments lmaoIf you want to go deeper into math, the collection \"Fundamentos da Matem\u00e1tica Elementar\" from Iezzi is really great, but it's really extensive (and most of the pdfs look like shit) so learn to prioritize contents.

Those people who had lived such practical lives had masterful terrain mapping, exceptional survival skills, and constant practice infinitely stronger then us. But that had to come from somewhere.

Wow, great way to get some fresh takes on the subject and not be damned to the same mystification forever.Yeah, I get where you're coming from. For something as crazy as quantum mechanics, you need to be dead certain it is true, otherwise you will think it's a conspiracy of physicists to say crazy nonsense. Feynman's Lectures III, Dirac's \"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\", and Landau and Lifschitz \"Quantum Mechanics\" are the best to read, in this order or simultaneously, all the other books just repeat material found in these, less comprehesively and with worse intuition. But you should also learn about the old Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization, to understand how the theory was discovered. One way is to go to \"Old Quantum Theory\", \"Adiabatic Invariant\", \"Matrix Mechanics\" pages on Wikipedia, and perhaps Ter-Haar's \"The Old Quantum Theory\" for a monograph length exposition. The old quantum theory doesn't take long--- it's one rule about quantizing the action variable. But there are insights here, the adiabatic invariance of the action, the quick semiclassiclal rules for number of quantum states, the estimates for the size of off-diagonal matrix elements for X and P operators in the energy representation in quantized versions of classical non-chaotic systems, that are very difficult to get to starting with the other more modern formulations. To complete the quantum mechanics education, you need to understand the Everett interpretation, this can be done by reading Everett's paper, or the book \"The Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\", along with the relevant Wikipedia pages.

Is a bird whoms beak ''evolves'' to specialize hunting an evolved bird? Well that really depends on the envoirment. We can equally say that the bird who didn't evolve is superior because when the envoirments change again, which they will. The bird who specalized finds itself useless and dies. So evolution, in physical terms does not exist or is incorrect and the notion should be revisited and adjusted. All things are equal, neither of the two birds evolved. If we reference the cambrian explosion we can definitely see that there is a TRANSFORMATION. What makes modern elephants superrior to the Mammoth? Can you really think of any reason why this would be an evolution? Considering evolution is commonly applied to survival of the ((Fittest)) which should be most <Adaptable>. Whom is superior or are both equal? Situated to suit envoirment they grow up in? Adapting; if we grow up in a hostile envoirment we will build different defense mechanisms than growing up in peacefull envoirments. Untill we are old enough to be self-dependeable/sustainable and get rid of these mechanisms that only served we survived when we could not take care of ourselves. If we did not build these mechanisms we would not survive. Whether that be lying to a parent because they get angry at everything. Or stealing to feed onself as to not die of hunger. All mechanisms of survival. But evolution does not exist in the way Darwin proposed. Science definitely is religion. Whom is critical enough of thought to defy it? Similarly to eastern religions which ask to be questioned, science in turn asks to be questioned.

Who is to say how large that niche is and how evolved you have to be to live only in the niche. Humans are evolved enough to live anywhere on the planet for varying amounts of time because our genome and previous ancestry traveled through every biome on Earth. One could say evolution operates to fill the niche but nobody states how big the niche is? Is it planet sized? Galaxy? Let's assume, for a moment, that we are alone in this vast universe.

You get the idea. ", " >>11515073>Humans are evolved enough to live anywhere on the planet for varying amounts of timeYeah that's true. I think you're mixing \"niche\" with \"habitat\" though.

The amount of evolution demonstrably has little to do with how large its habitat is, since monkeys are just as evolved as humans. You seem to be basing your idea of what evolution is on a specific result and not the process itself. It's essentially circular reasoning since you assume human civilization is the end goal of evolution and therefore evolution causes things to move towards human civilization.

Europeans closer to Asians--the tall hips they do have come from Basal Eurasian (African) ancestry spread by the Anatolians and Aryans. Real Europeans were more Asian looking morphologically--average white is only 60% European. It's why girls from Russia/Baltic look so much more feminine than Anglos or other westerners (they're closer to 80% European). The rest of the DNA is Middle Eastern from the Anat/Ary groups.In addition, C-sections = artificial dysgenic selection. They select narrow-hipped women who otherwise couldn't birth a child--these narrow hipped women also have smaller brains. C section also allows large-brain men to reproduce with narrow-hip women, which is not naturally possible.

Asian-white dating is mostly Asian women, white men. This is expected given social power, influence etc that whites have. white-black dating is mostly white women, black men. This is UNexpected given the current state of society. I think that fundamentally, these patterns are natural. A primitive/r-selected/narrowhip/smallbrain woman cannot pair with a progressive/K-selected/widehip/largebrain man. The problem arises when primitive women marry these progressive men for security. Their sex drive obeys nature, but their desire for security further propagates a dysgenic cycle.

The Schr\u00f6dingerequation speaking about \"energies\", but sets them up just as multiplies of the lowest frequency (technically, a diagonalizable operator where all eivenvalues are some real multiple of a lowest frequency). If you have light moving at constant speed, any t corresponds to distance traveled, so distance is captured in units of t just as well. Force is a spatial energy gradient, so 1/t^2. Mass is energy, i.e. 1/t too. Newtons F=m*a works out find with just that, where acceleration has units 1/t. \"Entropy\" ought to be just the log of the volume in a configuration space. You can multiply it with any energy to get the entropy from theormodynamics. The Boltzmann constant does this job. Pic only semi-related, even most professional physicist aren't willing to give up \"length\" as a conceptual seperate unit, even if you only ever need time for anything.Of course, if you go about with a ruler you come up with feet or inches or even centimeters and not think about light traveled, and if you stare at a light bump long enough, you come up with lumen and lux and all the brighness and radiance and light related units that obscrue the physics. In the end, there's really just time (or space, in any case it's t) and rates 1/t (frequencies, or even rates of rates, e.g. power). t and 1/t^n are relevant for physics. The rest is historical conversion factors.

It corresponded to an excess of \"black bile\" one of the four humors - the fundamental fluids of the body which conferred personality traits. The word melancholy is actually derived from the greek word from black bile. The diagnosis of melancholia lingered through medicine for centuries taking on a variety of different meanings related to sadness and lethargy. Abraham Lincoln was diagnosed with melancholia and was prescribed mercury as a cure. All of this is now correctly understood as pseudoscience.\"Depression\" is simply the modern rebranding of melancholia. It means pretty much the same thing: a nebulous emotional condition involving excessive sadness. The proposed etiology of depression is similarly pseudoscientific. The idea that depression results from a \"chemical imbalance\", a disruption of the fundamental fluids that constitute personality, bares striking similarity to the notion of the abnormal humors which were thought to cause melancholia. Furthermore, the \"chemical imbalance\" theory has been completely repudiated by all empirical attempts to confirm it. There is not a single study that links depressive symptoms to some kind of \"serotonin depletion\".For all of medicine's history, there have been people who experience excessive sadness for no clear reason. Instead of just admitting this, doctors of the past resorted to the baseless theory of \"melancholia\". The same thing happens today. No one has a clue why people suffer prolonged sadness. Every attempt to understand \"depression\" on a biological basis has been a complete failure. But instead of simply admitting this problem, the medical community has created the baseless theory of \"Major Depressive Disorder\".In one hundred years, no one will take \"depression\" seriously. The doctors who diagnosed it will be regarded in the same way that the doctors who diagnosed melancholia are.

How about boredom? Most people experience boredom as...> unpleasant> So \u2014 let\u2019s get started and substitute the word \u201cpathological\u201d for /unpleasant/> Doesn\u2019t that simple switch start to give it that \u2018disease feel\u2019 already? Pathological boredom!> The next step is to name our disease. How about \u201cinterest deficit disorder\u201d or \u201cmotivation deficit disorder\u201d? Better yet, let\u2019s find a medical-sounding word from Latin to substitute for boredom. How about \u201cDysmoveria\u201d? /Movere/ is Latin for motivation. By naming our disease, we are practically all the way to creating it. When you open a door to a new mental disorder millions of people will rush headlong right in and embrace it, as if they\u2019d been waiting their whole life for just this opportunity. Suddenly they aren\u2019t sad or anxious or bored\u2014they\u2019re afflicted with something.> We have our disease named: dysmoveria. It sounds a little strange now but it won\u2019t when tens of millions of people start using it and chatting about their disorder. \u201cI\u2019m taking Moveritol for my dysmoveria and it\u2019s working wonders!\u201d> Next we need a symptom picture. What does it look like and feel like when you\u2019re bored? Well, a bored person would probably experience some or all of the following:> 1. A lack of interest in usual pursuits> 2. Apathy about life> 3. A pessimistic attitude> 4. Feelings of \u201cemotional instability\u201d> 5. Difficulty concentrating on ordinary tasks> 6. A lack of energy> 7. Chronic fatigue> 8. Sleeping too much or too little> 9. Feelings of boredom ", " >>11370780> How many of these must be present in order for us to \u201cdiagnose the mental disorder\u201d of dysmoveria? Since obviously we want more rather than fewer people to fit the diagnostic criteria so that we can create plenty of patients and plenty of drug buyers for Moveritol, let\u2019s make sure that only a few symptoms are needed in order to qualify\u2014let\u2019s say, five. Let\u2019s continue pulling numbers out of thin air and say that these five symptoms must have been present for at least two weeks. Five symptoms, two weeks\u2014sounds good.> Let\u2019s also make this negotiable. If only four symptoms are present and if they\u2019ve only been present for twelve days, we\u2019re not going to quibble. Heck, if the \u201cprimary\u201d symptom is present\u2014feelings of boredom\u2014that\u2019s really enough! We\u2019ll call that looseness \u201cprofessional discretion.\u201d> Officially you will need to display five symptoms and have displayed them for two weeks. We offer no rationale for these numbers, as no rationale is needed when creating a new mental disorder. Nor could any rationale conceivably be provided. Unofficially, all you need to do is announce that you\u2019re bored\u2014that\u2019s all we really need to hear!> Next, if we were doing this \u201cfor real,\u201d we would gather a panel of clinicians\u2014some psychiatrists, psychologists, family therapists, and clinical social workers\u2014and we\u2019d ask them, \u201cDo your clients or patients ever report this symptom picture?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d they\u2019d cry in unison. \u201cWe see this all time!\u201d \u201cGreat!\u201d we\u2019d reply. \u201cWe have ourselves a genuine disorder!\u201d ", " >>11370783> Next we\u2019d work on \u201cdifferential diagnosis criteria,\u201d that is, on distinguishing dysmoveria from, say, clinical depression, which it quite resembles in its symptom picture. How would we know which was which? Naturally enough, we would know according to the self-reports of patients. The primary differential diagnostic criterion would be that if you reported feeling sad we\u2019d go with depression and if you reported feeling bored we\u2019d go with dysmoveria. Simple enough!> Next, how shall we treat dysmoveria? Well, with some \u201ccombination\u201d of treatments\u2014this allows everyone with a clinical practice to have patients. Whatever your license says you are allowed to do, we will say \u201cworks.\u201d Those clinicians like psychologists, family therapists and clinical social workers who can\u2019t prescribe medication will be permitted to \u201ctalk it away.\u201d Those clinicians like psychiatrists who can prescribe medication will be permitted to prescribe. We need not provide any rationale as to why a mental disorder should be treatable just by talking about it. Talking is a completely customary way to treat mental disorders and needs no rationale.> Of course we\u2019d get drug researchers right on it to create a drug that can reduce or eliminate the symptoms of dysmoveria. This is much simpler than it sounds, since there is no actual underlying disease to be treated. If you had a malignant tumor, you\u2019d need to treat the tumor and not just the symptoms of its presence. Here we are just treating symptoms, since there is nothing present \u201cunderneath\u201d except boredom. So our drug research can be up and running instantly, since our goal is the relatively simple one of eliminating or masking certain symptoms. ", " >>11370741Oh, you mean the softest of the sciences? Yea, I think the jury is still out on whether or not they should even be considered sciences. ", " >>11370786> An additional option, if we happen to have a few neuroscientists among our friends, would be to have them do a little brain scanning. You know what? They would discover that a brain looks different according to whether you do or don\u2019t have dysmoveria! Wow. When you\u2019re bored fewer parts of your brain light up than when you\u2019re excited. This kind of observation thrills people and sounds very scientific. It is completely meaningless in and of itself\u2014of course your brain will light up in different ways depending on whether you\u2019re watching the shopping channel or doing calculus\u2014but people take it to mean something. This is muddy cause-and-effect in action. So it\u2019s quite a useful add-on!> Naturally it helps in this process of creating mental disorders to be in a position of authority. Being a psychiatrist or having some association with a drug company wouldn\u2019t hurt. But, really, anyone can pull off the feat. Just write a book that makes the case for your new mental disorder, hire a publicist, and let\u2019s see how long it takes before patients line up! Wouldn\u2019t millions of people suddenly discover that they were suffering from \u201cemail distraction disorder\u201d or \u201cpost-retirement dysthmia\u201d as soon as they heard about it? You bet they would! ", " >>11370789> Any unwanted human experience can be turned into a mental disorder by following the simple steps I\u2019ve just outlined. Try it yourself with envy (invidia), rage (furorism), loneliness (infrequentia), or doubt (dubitarism). You can turn any normal human experience into a mental disorder following these steps. Sleeping more than usual? Going through the motions? Not interested in what\u2019s going on around you? Apathetic? Bored? That exactly describes a teenager on a two-week summer vacation with her parents! But now we have a better name for it: dysmoveria. Isn\u2019t it nice that soon there will be a drug to give your daughter so that she will be more pleasant and pliable when she accompanies you on your annual vacation to Nebraska?> I think you can see the basic ruse. What is the phrase \u201cmental disorder\u201d supposed to connote? As it is currently used, it means precisely the following: anything not wanted. All you need to do is give the unwanted experience a medical-sounding name and describe its look and you\u2019ve created a disorder. That look is called a \u201csymptom picture\u201d but that\u2019s just a fancy phrase meant to sound more impressive than \u201clook.\u201d Give a human experience a fancy name and describe its look\u2014that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed.

But you can still feel the distinct pyschoactive effect.SSRIs absolutely had a distinct psychoactive effect for me.

They could be genes that make you ugly, which would make you more likely to be unhappy in life, compared to someone who is attractive. Or they could be genes that give you other health conditions, which might also take an emotional toll upon you.>denies illness\"Illness\" is such a vaguely defined term that it's only right and proper to question what should deserve that label.

Suppose I defined \u201cintroversion\u201d as a disease. Most people would call this pseudoscience. There are myriad reasons that a person could act introverted ranging from social anxiety to literal head trauma. Lumping all of these disparate situations together into a single diagnostic category is clearly ridiculous. Nevertheless, there likely are genes which correlate to the symptom of introversion. The point I\u2019m trying to get at is that depression is clearly a symptom, not a disease. There are thousands of things that could cause this symptom. To fabricate a single diagnosis to cover all of them is illegitimate nonsense. Sure some people have genes that correlate with depressive symptoms. What about the people the don\u2019t.

Most of the time, no.

The other 63% is thought to be from your environment. So even if you had the shittest genes, it looks like the majority of the cause of depression is still your environment (then again the 37% might just be an average, so for some people maybe their risk is 53% genetic, I don't know, but you don't know either, because nobody knows).>>11372555>It is well documented how certain cases of genesNo, scientists are only just looking at specific genes.

But some genes might increase your risk of reacting in a depressive way to those events, rather than some other way.Here's how unsure we are about the genes:>The 5-HTTLPR, or serotonin transporter promoter gene's short allele has been associated with increased risk of depression.

They might be nothing to do with the brain.

They could be genes that make you short, make you ugly, whatever, and THOSE traits could make you unhappy, or more likely to snap and lose your mind due to the stresses of life.Not only this, but the drugs in psychiatry are horrible, have terrible side effects, and IT'S NOT EVEN KNOWN HOW SOME OF THEM WORK.When other sciences are using scalpels, all psychiatry has is blunt meat cleavers.Not only this, but psychiatry can lock you up and drug you against your will, even if you committed no crime.I am all in favour of proper brain research and understanding things like schizophrenia. Perhaps neurology is the better field for that, though.

But anyway, my strong opinion is that depression is simply learned helplessness: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessnessIf people fight harder and think more positively then they can improve their lives. Or they can take a drug (antidepressants) if they wish. I hate the latter, but each to their own. There really is no correct answer about which method is better, it's personal opinion. I would personally argue the former solution is better, because the latter clouds your thinking and makes you a drugged up zombie without their full faculties (from my experience).

You can pretend to yourself all you like that something \"just happens\" with no cause, but your pretending won't make it true.Everything has a cause. And if you're depressed, it's because your life is shit, or has made you unhappy in some way. Such problems include:>Job problems (stress, someone putting too much on you, etc.)>Relationship problems (unlucky in love, arguments with your spouse, etc.)>Physical health problems (e.g. lack of exercise, lack of sunlight, or other physical health problems)>Social problems (loneliness, ostracisation, etc.)>Diet problems (poor diet)And it could obviously be a combination of a few of these problems.I will answer your bit about hearing voices in another post.

But still, as said, this doesn't automatically make you schizophrenic.And then there are other major risk factors that bring about schizophrenia:>Prenatal malnutrition (your mother didn't / couldn't eat well during pregnancy)>Living in a city (maybe because it increases stress?)>Having an older father>Socioeconomic disadvantage>Social exclusionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophreniaSo I guess it's a combination of having certain genes, and then suffering setbacks like poor nutrition, shitty life circumstances / significant psychological stresses, that kind of thing.ALSO, just to point out, you were comparing schizophrenia and depression. But the heritability of \"major depressive disorder\" is estimated at only 37%, so that means 37% of your risk is thought to be genetic, with the other 63% resulting from your personal experiences.

When you look at the genomes of other animals, like chimps, you notice that they have the same lines of code in the same places as humans. Thousands of different codes, all in the exact same place in humans and chimps.  How can that be if the virus puts their code in a random place? If humans and chimps were infected, the virus would insert its code in one random place in humans and another random place in chimps. But they didn't. The only explanation for how this could occur is if humans and chimps inherited the same code from a common ancestor that was infected with that code.

I did not or could not feel certain things before I tripped- the best way to explain that is thinking about what it might be like if you saw and felt everything from the middle of your head instead of the front of your face. The world suddenly got more detailed and, at the same time, clearer. I get that's a weird way to put it, but this is just a weird question in general.Now, reading up on HPPD, I wanted to know if it could be a naturally occurring phenomenon that could happen during birth (due to xyz). There were many features of HPPD that seemed very similar to how I grew up receiving and understanding the world around me.

There certainly is a discrimination against men and masculine values of various kinds, some of which are prosocial or at best neutral, others which definitely are not. And the bar for what a man must do or be to win a woman over in the game of reproduction is raised. Both before and after conception of the child. At the same time, more is expected from women. Not only are they given more responsibility and power over reproduction (it was more cooperative before), partially by the introduction of contraceptives, they are also expected to work more, be more financially independent and/or be powerful and disproportionally prosperous in the same way that men have been expected to. Feminism both expects and helps women to adopt the responsibilities of men while not reducing many of the existing responsibilities of women, and it confuses and exhausts them. Most men on the other hand are loosing even more than before in terms of reproduction (increasing sexual dimorphism). And it is made even harder for the male to rise to the few and decreasing prosperous positions (increased disparity of outcome) partially because women are now also \"competing\" for them (they get some help, that is, men are discriminated against). It is not clear to me how I can compute which of the gender is loosing more in terms of quality of life, but clearly men are loosing even more than before terms of sheer reproduction (stats are clear on this). Thus a minority of the response from feminists might not be denial of this effect (majority is denial, ignorance or willful deception), but rather a cry that women are suffering more as well.

The delay is set to five seconds because there is a pump that is being powered at the same time as the heater.

Add an if statement after that that checks if it's over 37 degrees, if so, turn the heater off. THIS is where you should put your delay if anything. You also need a global variable with the STATE of your heater so you can avoid turning it off if it's already off, turning on if it's already on etc. This should be changed when you turn it on or off and checked before you turn it on or off.

Yes, all the coal worker can now switch to natural gas to keep their jobs until they retire. Renewable power follows a normal distribution. If you have an average of 30% renewables then your average day will have 50% renewables. Extremely low output say 10% may happen but the probability of that happening gets lower and lower the more extreme it is. That means that on around 10 days per year you may only have 20% renewable power output. The shortfall can be covered with natural gas which is load following unlike coal. This means 90% of the time renewables are enough and you may need natural gas during extreme events.Why are natural gas plants more desirable than coal? They produce less emissions per kWh. They are less expensive to build. (remember they must stay idle most of the time so they can't be expensive). Coal plants can only throttle their output to 75% of their maximum production capacity. Natural gas plants can throttle arbitrarily. Finally the key ingredient. Natural gas is more expensive than renewables per kWh.
