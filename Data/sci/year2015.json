I add the condition x doesn't divide y because if it does, then you end up with just the multiples of x, and so you may not have integer solutions. (i.e. x = 6, y = 12, then any combination is a multiple of 6.. clearly there is no integer solution a * 6 + b * 12 = 1).The reason I ask is that I believe from trial and error that if you have two integers where x doesn't divide y, and they are two known elements of an ideal of the integers, that the ideal ends up containing all integers (if I can show 1 is in the ideal, then 1 + n * 1 can be solved for any integer). The reason I'm even wondering this in the first place is that I was curious if you can generate an ideal in the integers using more than one number (rather than say, the multiples of a single number). However, exploring it made me think you just end up with all the integers and not a proper ideal.Please help, I've been stuck on this for hours. "}, "replies": [" Look up \"extended euclids algorithm\"it does exactly this - it finds a, b, d such that ax + by = dThe only way d can equal 1 is if a and b are relatively prime to each other ", " >>7648223I know that part, but I don't know how to show that using d, a, x, b, y, that you can generate all integers using addition and subtraction over those numbers, or multiplication by any integer, or division where quotients are integers.The only reason I wanted to solve for 1 was because it's very easy to show the ideal includes all integers if I have it. For what it's worth, I wrote a program to calculate a and b for certain ranges, but it gave me no insight to how to find them (all the values I tried had solutions.. so of course maybe I just didn't try the right ones, but it gave me faith that this idea must be true). However, I really don't have to solve for 1. I could solve for n = ax + by where n can be any integer, but I thought solving for 1 would be easier (it implies the rest).I could almost just use the euclidean algorithm to say the integers are a euclidean domain so you can always solve m = qn + r for integer solutions of m,q,n,r, however this means I must know that all integers 0 <= r < n (or in this case, n = i or n = j) are elements of the ideal, which I don't know. I would have to solve 0 = ax + by, 1 = ax + by, 2 = ax + by, ... (x-1) = ax + by before I could solve n = qx + r using the ideal. Again, this is because addition is only closed for an ideal if performed between elements of an ideal. I made a little program with ED's though, by saying: x = qy + r for some integers q and r, x - qy = r. I can say r is in the ideal since both x and qy are elements in the ideal, so now I can add or subtract r to any multiple of x or y. However, I still don't see how I can span the integers or what the next step is to accomplish that.I do feel like I could do something with the euclidean domain definition and make this a lot less work, but of course that's just a feeling.Sorry for the wall of text.

Then 1 is in the ideal generated by x and y, so this ideal is indeed the whole integer ring. This is because any time an ideal contains a unit, then the ideal is the whole ring : if u is a unit in I, then 1 is in I, then for all a in the ring, 1a=a is in the ideal which means the ring is contained in the ideal, i.e. is equal to the ideal. You seem to know this fact.An euclidean domain is a principal domain, i.e. all its ideals are generated by one element. Integers are obviously an euclidean domain. You can generate an integer ideal with as much elements you want ; in the end, they have a (computable) gcd which is the generator of the whole ideal. Again, if this gcd is a unit, you get the whole ring. But you seem to know this fact too.So... I don't understand what you're tying to do. ", " >>7648223Ahhhhh, IFF coprime, no solutions. So my whole idea wasn't true, but it is true and easily provable if the two numbers are coprime.However, I had a eureka moment following this. I got 3 cases anon,Case 1: x divides y, clearly just the set of multiples of xCase 2: x coprime to y, then 1 = ax + by, so it spans the integers (and is not a proper ideal)Case 3: x doesn't divide y but shares a factor with yx + y should be in the ideal (closed for addition), but check if it's a multiple of x or y, you get x/x + y/x, or y/y + x/y, so you always get some fractional term (since we know y/x and x/y is not an integer), so here's a case where the ideal wouldn't be closed. In fact, this covers case 2.Well that's that, thanks anon, you got me on the track track by saying \"the ONLY way...,\" I forgot about that part of the bezout's identity! ", " >>7648310on the right track***>>7648312The question I wanted to answer was whether you could have an ideal generated by 2 elements. In other words, is there any integer ideal that is not simply the set of multiples of some integer (and not a trivial ideal like {0}). In order to do this, I had to show it was not a proper subset of the integers or led to some more immediate contradiction, which I believe I have now done.

A lot of people say \"wow I wish I could do my master's in a year\" but it's not necessarily a good thing. MScs are one year and PhD's are almost always strictly limited to three years in the UK, due in large part to the pressure from government/lawmakers to capitalize on the UK's position as a gateway to the English speaking world.

But they were what I was good at in high school, so i was very self doubting. Being cheated off of was a privilege to me, it made me feel as though I had a value to some people, not matter how robotic that value was.It also meant that I could easily fuck people up hard.Which I never really did very much, I never got someone a C for cheating off me, but that feeling of power was also nice.I was seen as a saint in teacher's eyes, so there was no chance of anyone punishing me for allowing the cheating.

Both work to undermine broader confidence in science and endorsement by course success respectively, though they generally provide a larger benefit than liability to the individual cheater. Liability is shared by the entire community in question.People will differ as to whether or not they see their personal interests more compelling than their stakes in this shared interest. For instance, if you go around outing authors who invented data, chances are you will be regarded nervously and have fewer options for collaboration. It's much smaller in scope and of less consequence in undergraduate courses (hence more frequent cheating,) but professors are usually nonetheless forced to take allegations of cheating very seriously (administrators have no options for advancement by cheating, so they fall solidly on the side of institutional interest and thus have a much higher standard for due dilligence) while the professor may privately think you're petty or a dirty narc for bringing it up and forcing them into action.

However, any absorbed radiation must still be re-radiated as infrared, which itself may be detected with current (expensive) technology (think NEAR and the like). Furthermore, radio-frequency coatings simply cannot be absorbed substantially, and MUST be reflected to some degree (granted, radar detection is only really a concern for short ranges <5000 km). So, for a rigorous, multispectrum-conscious approach, reflecting radiation MUST be considered and efforts should be made to reduce scattering as much as possible. This means shaping your external hull carefully, with few compound curves and with surface normals confined to very narrow regions. If this is taken to a sufficient degree, a polished, deliberately-reflective surface may even be preferable to an absorptive one, as it will reduce the amount of heat that will need to be re-radiated.

The heat still has to go somewhere. A Soyuz-sized spacecraft with an absorptive coating is going to have to absorb roughly 10 kW of solar irradiation.

So yeah... good luck with that. ", " >>7258499>even a small projectile can do a lot of damageThis. It can be a tennis ball moving at 0.9999 c, and it would completely wreck a planet's surface. 30% c projectile would be more easy to detect, since to deal damage you would also need to make it bigger, but an advanced enough civilisation would have no problems with reaching ultrarelativistic velocities.Detection of an ofject in the interstellar space is just incredibly hard. Maybe a fast enough object would collide with the interstellar matter and radiate because of it, which should faciliate task a little.

The energy's got to go somewhere, and for a fairly modest investment in picket ships or sensor drones, the enemy can pretty much block you from safely radiating to any significant portion of the sky.And if you try to focus the emissions into some very narrow cone you know to be safe, you run into the problem that the radiator area for a given power is inversely proportional to the fraction of the sky illuminated. With proportionate increase in both the heat leakage through the back surfaces, and the signature to active or semi-active (reflected sunlight) sensors.Plus, there's the problem of how you know what a safe direction to radiate is in the first place. You seem to be simultaneously arguing for stealthy spaceships and complete knowledge of the position of enemy sensor platforms. If stealth works, you can't expect to know where the enemy has all of his sensors, so you can't know what is a safe direction to radiate. Which means you can't expect to achieve practical stealth using that mechanism in the first place.Sixty degrees has been suggested here as a reasonably \"narrow\" cone to hide one's emissions in. As a sixty-degree cone is roughly one-tenth of a full sphere, a couple dozen pickets or drones are enough to cover the full sky so that there is no safe direction to radiate even if you know where they all are.

All of these are methods of multiplying which a student can discover for themselves by doing the evil \"times table\" form a bunch of different neural connections in the young brain, giving at least 3 different methods of finding 7*8. The student takes some ownership of these, because they discovered this connection themselves, so they remember it better, and make 3 different neural connections, which basically gives 3 different places in their brain to store the fact \"7*8=56.\"Common Core explicitly teaches all those methods, plus a number of other ones, like 7*8=(5+2)*8= 5*8+2*8, or 40+16=56. Or (10-3)*(10-2)=100-20-30+6=56 (You know, FOIL.) So a student who can answer \"7*8=56\" because they know the multiplication fact get marked wrong because they can't multiply binomials in 3rd grade.

At the same time I had no problem with it whatsoever (using the old system of course)We seem to disagree on whether or not common core makes up for this.

The books & problems listed here are methods by which to accomplish said goal, not the other way around. I must reiterate, CC is a requirement or ceiling students must reach by a specified date. It is not what is taught, how it is taught, or when whatever concept is taught. The reason there are issues is because CC was rushed through and textbooks weren't able to adequately update. This lead to a clusterfuck that will probably remedy itself in the next five years.I mean some of the problems are pretty shit like the social studies questions. That being said, if there is consistent and clear improvement over time then I can't really argue against it. The alternative was probably one of the most fragmented and obtuse system. Two different schools could be in completely different sections, concepts, or books entirely. The consistency is definitely welcomed, even if it was poorly done.

With low/normal densities (planets/stars), the body is large enough that you hit the surface before gravity becomes too strong. Getting closer to the center (\"digging\"), gravity actually diminishes (reaching zero in the center of a spherical body: same mass equally pulling you in every direction).But when all mass is concentrated in a single point, you can get arbitrarily close to it, and gravity increases to the point where the escape velocity exceeds that of light (event horizon and definition of black hole).A more difficult question that always bugged me: we know next to nothing about the insides of a black hole, but everyone, everywhere always states that the singularity is a finite mass (that of star, minus ejected material) concentrated in a single, dimensionless point (i.e. infinite density).What physical principle makes us so sure about this? To have a black hole, it is enough to have a mass confined within its Schwartzschild radius. Why should a mass collapsed within this radius should just keep collapsing up to a single point?

The best answer to your question, OP, is that for cardinals A and B (viewed as isomorphism classes of sets), A^B is a cardinal representing the isomorphism class of sets of maps from a set of cardinality B to a set of cardinality A. For finite cardinals, this is simply exponentiation as we are taught in middle school.Let 0 be the empty set (the unique set of cardinality 0). Then, 0^0 is the set of functions from 0 to 0. There is exactly one such function, which takes \"nothing\" to \"nothing\". To verify that this map exists, observe that 0 is the initial object in Set, and thus for ANY set A (not just 0), there is a unique map from 0 to A.0^0 is nonempty, but it's also easily shown that there can be no more than one such function, because two functions are equivalent iff they have equivalent images, and the lack of objects in 0 make this image unique. The reason 0^A is zero for nonzero A is because a function cannot take an object to nothing. This is why 0 is not the terminal object of Set.

Lest offered by a human.>>7111114Not sure about that, but it is true, adults probably shouldn't be drinking any milk at all.Really, adult lactose tolerance is kinda of abnormal. The only reason any of us have it at all, is because about 5000 years ago, some nomadic herders started starving to death, and those who could drink milk lived to breed more often. In this era of plentiful food, no reason to attempt to keep that up, especially with so many individuals suddenly lacking the tolerance, and how imperfect tolerance can be.

It's not exactly fashionable or a scapegoat for any vice like these other things you've mentioned.Your logic seems like lactose intolerance is on the rise, hypochondria is probably on the rise, therefore they're probably correlated. Furthermore, hypochondria can be a generic catch all for anything almost. It's more logical to first eliminate other possibilities if presented before instantly going to the most common thing. That's like sending ebola patience home because they have flu symptoms in the essence of logical application.On the fashionable note, it's a bit like my dad who gets acid reflux from bay leaves and tomato sauce in pizza. Why exactly would people imagine such a thing up? He loves pizza and food with bay leaves, but he just can't eat them at certain times of the day. People who have lactose intolerance are the same way, at least in my experience. They love milk to some degree, but just can't quite handle it.I just keep coming around to gut flora, and it gets dismissed all to often without any solid reasoning, evidence, or cited research for that to be a coincidence if we're playing a probabilities game. ", " >>7112036>>7112036Don't think there needs to be any motivational benefit to the user for it to be over diagnosed, quite the opposite really. And I would add acid reflux to the list. Someone gets an upset stomach from eating pizza \"must be acid reflux\", bitches to doctor, gets pill, check box, and epidemic.A lot of these things there's no real test for, as they are psychological spectrum disorders (including ADD, ADHD, and Autism). So there's no real way to say for sure. Of all those mentioned, restless leg syndrome is the only one you could really test sufferers for vs. over prescription. By the time someone actually got around to doing a study on that (and discovered over prescription was something like 1500%, for a genetically induced condition that was actually rare as fuck), the medicine had already been re-assigned to treat depression (yet another spectrum disorder).Otherwise, it's \"just muh opinion man\" - but well, so are nearly all spectrum disorders.Not saying people don't actually suffer from all these things, mind you. Just probably not nearly as many as are reported, and awareness/invention of these conditions, is more responsible for their outbreaks, than any \"mysterious environmental factor\".Mind ye (and to bring us back to topic), I'm not dropping the human microbiome into that category. We've been aware of its existence for ages, you can test for that shit, it's there. It's only recently we've started putting such a high value on it, but similarly, that's because we've recently discovered the mind<->body and bacteria<->body interaction is considerably more sophisticated than previously thought.On the other hand, there's probably a whole lotta people blaming symptoms on microbiome imbalance, who have no such issues.

That said, there's still more than one approach to introducing infinitesimals to mathematics.The more well known/popular way is by creating a proper superset of the real numbers dubbed the hyperreals. These hyperreals contain extra numbers (infinitesimals) that are not real numbers and a few extra axioms regarding their interactions with the reals. The formal foundations to this were worked out by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s and you can find a good introduction in either of Keisler's creative commons books. Robinson's book is more comprehensive and covers everything from the formal logic up to analysis and topology on the hyper reals (though you can find more modern resources online as well).https://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/foundations.pdfhttps://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/keislercalc-12-27-13.pdfThe less common approach is to use intuitionistic logic instead of classical logic. The idea is that since intuitionistic logic has a weaker proof system then it works out so that we can no longer prove that infinitesimals are inconsistent. We then only define some clever ways for them to work and we can now develop calculus and differential geometry with them. Here are a couple introductory papers on the subject.http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3307v1.pdfhttp://www.tc.umn.edu/~hellm001/Publications/MathematicalPluralismSIA.pdf ", " >>7086851>1.

The only reason they are viewed as antiquated is because while they were the original way we did calculus it took until the mid 1900s for people to figure out ways to formalize them.

I cannot find anything on how this programs utilize hardware, all of it seems to be some big secret.

You could also OC the RAM if you buy some cooling for it.Worth finding out if these softwares use CUDA, since that will involve getting a GPU.Now regarding your choice of CPU, it doesn't seem to support quad channel. You have to go to i7's for that. Starting at the i7-4820K there is quad channel support.http://ark.intel.com/products/80811/Intel-Core-i5-4690K-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_90-GHzhttp://ark.intel.com/products/77781/Intel-Core-i7-4820K-Processor-10M-Cache-up-to-3_90-GHzIf you want to shell out 1k for a CPU, http://ark.intel.com/products/82930/Intel-Core-i7-5960X-Processor-Extreme-Edition-20M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHzSupport quad channel, of course, works with 8 cores with 16 threads and has 20MB of cache.

GPGPU isn't a priority for me since I'm not doing graphics heavy stuff and the program I plan to be using (COMSOL) doesn't support it. But I want to keep the option open.

It's fairly easy to overburden even the most high-end CPU with a simple simulation (even a wave-field simulation) if you just scale it up a little.

Or one of those 8 core AMD processors.In addition to CUDA, there are also dedicated physics modules out there (e.g. PhysX). Ask your software maker if it supports those... in general, dedicated hardware ought to be really helpful.>>7037702> limited by the software/code CFD simulations can quite nicely take advantage of as many processors as you throw at them.
