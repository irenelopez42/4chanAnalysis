In his video 'America Pox' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEkhe says the reason some diseases kill humans is because they are zoonoses (diseases that cross over to humans from animals) meaning they're too strong for our immune systems. I knew about zoonoses but he said something I'd never heard, that whooping cough and the flu are zoonoses from pigs, and cows gave us measles, tuberculosis and small pox. I just looked it up and tuberculosis probably didn't come from cows originally (although it is true that cows can transmit TB to humans) since the strains of TB found in humans and in cows share a common ancestor. This isn't new research, the source for that statement is a paper from 2009 and the video was made in 2015. I also just looked up smallpox and while an unsourced wikipedia article claimed it was, I found an academic paper stating that there are no known animal reservoirs for the disease meaning no way to test the DNA/RNA of the virus in humans and compare it against its animal counterpart, so the only statements I found about smallpox being zoonotic say it 'may' be and is 'believed to be' so it seems a bit fantastic to say YEAH IT DEFINITELY CAME FROM COWS BRO, especially since at least one academic source I saw said dogs and cats. Same story for measles. I understand it's the nature of education to gloss over some details to show students a larger truth (while this video was probably wrong about a few points it did show me that zoonoses are way more common than I thought) and public school teachers lied to me more than anyone, I wonder just how many discrepancies like this are in CPG Grey's videos and if /sci/ has watched them at all ", " >>7755177missed new thread[spoiler:lit]?[/spoiler:lit] ", " >>7755141yeah, he just said one of darpas projects is a self programming AI, that means uncle sam is providing the funding.

In his equations, the total amount of energy can be very rudimentarily expressed as K+U+C=EWhere \"C\" is the cosmological constant. He solved this equation for a certain value of C, yet another following physicist (I forget his name, forgive me. Not really relevant though) demonstrated that if this value C was adjusted even slightly in either direction, the universe would either expand or contract. This is why we have such a conundrum with expansion, as we have not developed a stable or complete model to compensate for both the universe's acceleration (while we also get deceleration). It's really a pickle, but the only thing we can agree on is that a static model of the universe contradicts the maths in almost every area and interpretation, causing physicists to alter gravity, or introduce new forces. The bottom line is that this universe is not going to last forever, so \"sustainable\" contradicts the very nature of our universe on a larger scale. Humanity will most likely never glimpse the end of the universe, but as it seems nothing lasts forever. These other parallel universes, do they have a death?

I'm not of the deterministic point of view but in most of the cases the universe acts as a reacting machine (or a multivariable function if you like), given the identity, position (which is quantifiable), and state of every particle, you can certainly compute the next 'step' of the system (because time isn't continuous it is divided in Planck time 'fragments'). And if we asume the original universe of the machine works the exact same way and as we've said before there exist a certain limit for that simulation the coefficient between the size limit of the simulation and the size of the original universe would predict what would happen if we nested simulations. If that coeficent is less than one, every universe consecuently siulated would be smaller and smaller until it reached the limit where you can simulate another universe because it would be smaller than a planck length (but, probably there would be a limit far before that point because of obvious reasons). If the coefficient is more than one every universe simulated has the potettial for being bigger than the original so no one would ever perceive a difference in that and probably this problem wouldn't be ever noticed.

The real answer is that the engineers who design a universe-scale simulation are going to be deeply aware of these issues, have a firm understanding of what things would look like if they were the simulated version of themselves, and will explicitly scan the universe for simulations so that they can avoid wasting time computing the simulation strata itself. Compression occurs at the exact moment that simulation turns on and not a single second sooner.A better question would be how long you expect the simulation to run before it catches up to itself. Even being generous and giving it 100 thousand years or so, that's 100 thousand years for any simulation-capable economy's computational resources to collapse.

But the amount of sustained processing power which that would require is so mind-boggingly large, that any entity or entities that achieved such would be god or gods, and the whole argument becomes moot.In the apparently realistic universe where A << S, any simulation would necessarily encompass a smaller virtual volume of space or span of virtual time (probably both) than the size and duration of the real universe.

", " >>7732280>when you smoke the tobacco these compounds enter your lungs and can mutate the DNA in whichever cells it enters.Expanding on this point. It isn't the only mechanism that smoking may increase risk of cancer, but it is a big one.Flat, hydrophilic, aromatic compounds like benzene and other derivatives are common in cigarettes and other tobacco products.When these compounds enter cells they can \"slide\" between DNA bases and cause mutation of the cell by interfering with DNA replication. This process is an example of intercalation.Usually when this occurs the apoptotic cycle will kick in, kill off the cell and replace it with a new healthy cell, but it is possible that the mutation of the DNA will result in a cell that replicates itself, and proliferate further.This is a cancer cell. A normal cell that has lost its off-switch and will just keep growing and spreading.As I said, usually cancer doesn't happen. The cell dies off and is replaced. Cancer happens by chance mutation, and the probability of developing cancer rises by participating in risky behaviours, like pumping hydrocarbons into your lungs. Flat hydrocarbons like benzene are absurdly common in modern environments and people ingest them every day of their lives, so the possibility of this happening is pretty much universal for everyone, but as stated, smoking significantly increases your exposure to these compounds and increases your risk of developing cancer.

Then D-Sucrose into lactic acid via fermentation. whether or not that is a more or less cost effective option than purchasing feedstock lactic acid would be determined by>amount of PLA you want to make (tonnage / year) >price variations in both feedstocks (cheap start vs lactic acid feed stock)1) From there, it looks like there's a necessity for a high purity stereo-selective feedstock of low molecular weight lactic acid polymers. it looks like stereo selectivity and using starter molecules is pretty important. This will drive up purification costs considerably when using a cheap starch source. The separations involved are more than likely going to be capital investment low, but the high reflux in distillation columns will rape you in utilities. You will also have reactor capital costs as well as utilities for heating it for the initial formation of low MW starter moleculesThat being said, Lactic acid production form these sources is very old and has been done for a long time and thus relatively \"perfected\". This might lead to purchasing clean Lactic acid as a feedstock being the better option (if you can find chemical price indexing for feedstock lactic acid, you'll be lucky. that shits hard to come by realistically if you're talking industrial scale, other wise there's ali baba .com for small orders) 2) after you have a clean feedstock of low MW Lactic acid polymers, the reaction that will take the most time. This occurs via catalytic dehydration of the starter molecules into linear chains. So>capital costs for reactor (considerable, as you'll need a tin based catalyst, which is lucky its not an exotic metal)>distillation costs to remove water to drive reaction equilibrium to the final products, also very energy intensiveThe bad: it sounds like the bugs are proprietary, and economies of scale is the only thing that makes this really viable at all ", " >>7730685>>7730675>>7730672Interesting they already had costs put out.

If you can separate on the fly without hurting the bugs or their digestion kinetics, then you run a steady state fermentation and purge off the product.if its not, then you up size batch scale operation so a single run gives you the timely throughput your looking for and discard the bugs. >tl;dr, when conversion or yield is low, you just upsize the reactor within reasonable limits, which in this case wouldn't be that bad>>7730685no sorry needed.

On top of that though, the purification will probably have to happen. there will be alot of \"garbage\" in it, even if you run your towers with high reflux rations trying to get good separations. >again, this is all just from what it sounds and there's a few companies with patents on the bugs and the purification process i think>>7730721well, odds are those wouldn't be hot enough. most distillation columns in indusry are run by 10-100 PSI steam (hotter than regular steam), as the reboilers need higher temps. for this situation, i rough estimate would be lactic acid and waterBP h2o - 100BP lactic acid - 129not alot of room to work there. it doesnmt appear they form an azeo trope though, the separation isnt going to be spectacular.

If it broke locality, or causation, I'd assume it were impossible. For finer details, like glowing metal or the detailed behaviour of electromagnetic systems, I don't know if that would impact life.Essentially, I'd find it very weird if we lived in a universe with a speed limit and it were not necessary for life for that limit to exist, and I'm trying to establish if this is the case.

", " >>7723456A universe like ours but with no speed limit probably wouldn't have life or at least not intelligent life since there'd be no causality and how could intelligence come about in an environment like that? You could have though a universe with arbitrarily fast speeds but an absolute frame of reference. At one time we thought this was how our universe worked and the aether was the theoretical absolute standard of rest. In such a universe though only measurements and observations made with respect to the aether could be correct. So in that universe the laws of physics could be different from different frames of reference. ", " >>7723456>Essentially, I'd find it very weird if we lived in a universe with a speed limit and it were not necessary for life for that limit to exist, and I'm trying to establish if this is the case.Well, as I mentioned, there's three ways to build a universe where relativity (in the sense of space not being absolute, not as in Einstein) holds true. One of them underlies classical physics, one of them underlies modern physics, and in one of them life's probably impossible because matter should be unstable.So, if we assume that purely-classical life is possible, and posit an aether, then the anthropic principle doesn't require the existence of a maximum speed. However, there's another wrinkle - the universe with a maximum speed is much *simpler.* For instance, relativity collapses Maxwell's separate electric and magnetic fields into a single phenomenon - the effects of the magnetic field can be derived directly from analyzing Coloumb's law when charges are moving relative to one another. And it unifies energy and momentum into a single four-vector - no longer two separately conserved quantities, but a single fundamental thing. And of course, you no longer need \"space\" and a mysteriously separate \"time\" but only one singular unified thing. And it seems quite plausible to say that simpler universes are more \"likely\" - after all, it takes less information to specify them.

There is a gamma factor, which depends on the speed of light (an experimentally determined constant found in the Michelson-Morley experiments). As we know from classical mechanics, momentum p= m*v. We also know classically that Force is the derivative of momentum, F=  (because the gamma factor times v is the actual velocity).Taking the derivative gives As you can see, as velocity approaches c, the denominator approaches 0, and so the Force required is infinite.

A power plant won't become profitable for several years after its activation, necessitating government subsidies for every single plant that opens.

(I think it's better than the alternatives, but whatever)Second, the average person on the street doesn't know anything more about radiation than \"it's an invisible substance that kills you\" (and yes, I know \"substance\" isn't even accurate but look at media portrayals of dangerous radiation areas: it's usually a green fog or a pool of dark blue-tinted water or some shit). Despite their exposure to tons of radiation every day from phones and the goddamn sun, people treat it like a boogeyman and don't want anything to do with it. It's the old \"everyone who drinks dihydrogen monoxide dies\" joke made real. And that's simply not going to change until popular film, literature, and even videogames stop treating radiation as a scary, unknowable killing force.The problem is, solar and wind just don't meet the growing energy needs of society.

And of course that danger can be minimized with fuel recycling to minimize the amounts of long-lived waste isotopes produced to generate a given amount of energy.Actual radiation incidents are definitely worse than mere chemical pollution, largely because radiation takes longer to dissipate, however nuclear plants do not actually release radioactive materials into the atmosphere unless something goes horribly wrong, whereas normal pollution is an inevitable consequence of fossil fuel power. Currently there is no way to totally abandon both fossil fuel and nuclear if we want to keep power consumption at anywhere near current levels. Wind, solar, and hydroelectric power should be used wherever feasible, since they produce NEITHER radiation nor pollution, however we will still need to use nuclear for some of our power.

Overall, fossil fuel is more deadly than nuclear. Unless we decide to start letting people with no qualification operate reactors, we won't have anything as bad as Chernobyl. And even that didn't render entire countries uninhabitable. Even a reactor like the one at Chernobyl, highly unstable and with no containment building, could not turn into a nuclear bomb no matter what you did to it. What you could get is a steam explosion spreading radioactive materials - but that can be minimized with a containment building, which Chernobyl lacked but virtually all modern reactors have.>>7704920At the time, pretty much every reactor required active cooling.

This serves to greatly enhance the skeptic's case by ignoring that the empirical evidence greatly favors the mainstream case. When we actually measure feedback and climate sensitivty we find that feedback is positive and the sensitivity is about 3 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2. The skeptics case is also described as a fundamentally inaccurate idea, that clouds are a negative feedback since they reflect sunlight away from Earth. In reality, they both reflect sunlight away from Earth AND trap radiative heat inside the Earth.http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3799.1http://www.iac.ethz.ch/people/knuttir/papers/knutti08natgeo.pdfThe video then moves on to Hansen's 1988 scenarios. But these scenarios are based on specific guessed amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. These specific guessed amounts are not what actually occurred, so it is no surprise that the scenarios do not appear to match the temperature record. It is silly to say that his model is incorrect when the point is to predict the effect of emissions, not to guess accurately the amount of emissions, which is based on political, economic, non-climatological factors. The model does accurately predict the warming effect of emissions. The video also misleadingly attempts to obfuscate the accuracy of the model by pointing to a specific data point rather than comparing the projected trend to the real trend. It even claims that the low 1990 estimate is higher than the average trend, without proof. It is common among laypeople to confuse the average trend with the change from the first point in the dataset to the last point, but the two are completely different, and it should be understood that these points are arbitrary, variable, and do not reflect the real trend.

Just from letting them talk about how they feel, they would have someone to truly confide in.

Not so trustworthy if you put it into these perspectives.Second would be concealed carry. The fact that concealed carry isn't an inalienable right in the US is absurd. It would more than likely decrease the amount of time that any active shooter may be around rampaging by immediate neutralisation.Finally, remove the two following \"policies.\" No Child Left Behind, and Zero Tolerance Policy. First is because it just encourages normally intelligent people to be with those who are intellectually disabled and weens out those who are unable to keep up. The second because it is useless. Zero tolerance policy just turns everything into a bureaucratic mess that gets nothing sorted out and needs \"100%\" certainty that something happened before any action from administrative levels occur.In my personal opinion though, I just wish school shootings happen more often.

The reaction has to happen very quickly, so there isn't time for catalysts to act.Plastic explosives are basically explosives in a binder. If the binder is combustable, and the explosive is oxygen rich, then it will contribute to the explosive power.\"Explosive force\" isn't a sufficiently clear concept. There is the energy released, the form it's released as, and the time it's released in. The main figures of interest (look these up yourself) are energy density and detonation velocity (which should be called \"detonation speed\", but people say \"velocity\" because it sounds more sciency). An important concept is \"brisance\".Explosives work by abruptly converting a compact object into a lot of hot gas in a small initial volume. The gas expands forcefully, and this is the explosion. The makeup of the gas matters. Hydrogen, for instance, will expand faster because it's such a light molecule. Solid reaction products tend to reduce efficiency because they don't expand, and they also make visible smoke.Most explosives are nitrogen compounds, due to nitrogen's strong affinity for itself, resulting in many compounds that readily revert to gaseous nitrogen plus whatever was combined with the nitrogen. As such, under primitive circumstances, they tend to be made from things like urine and guano, taking advantages of the waste products of protein metabolism. In the modern world, they are made starting from the same processes as synthetic fertilizer, beginning with combining nitrogen and hydrogen under pressure and with a catalyst to make ammonia.It's difficult under primitive conditions to make anything more sophisticated than black powder, a low-explosive mixture of carbon, sulfur, and saltpeter.

Then the system collects the incoming data simultaniously while solving it from either two replicates of reality or if one wants, incoming data raw data and the replicate.Replicate should be the same as the raw data yet due to its ''enormisity?'' and the amount of actions each human proof requires it is then agreed that reality is extremely difficult to proof but must the system interpretate the data this way? Unless the perimeter has an triangle itself , an back up amount of vast knowledge coded into this dead component, to have its only circle of design be forth to centralize this knowledge to then ''see'' and judge the data. Yet seeing would be an coded term, it has no lens. So, when these components work you have created an judge towards two doubted realities. These two doubted realitys must eventually form one stable reality yet the doubting of the total is constant and ongoing. It must have a unique perimeter to start solving reality. In this experiment, it can then looked at in 2D of the total data. A plain triangle, and what each segment of information it holds. So B is the alteraction device of the brain while A is raw data. In a computer it would be an extremely large 1 variable intperation of the data. Yet the entire variable must spread via the width and length of the perimeter. The data that for example has an word ''cows'' the 'ws' could be an nano milimeter lower. Yet cows would be there, that specifailly one also, yet many many other cows due to the amount of data it contains. Even though it does not say cows.

Which I can't really summarize down right now, but it'd be the ideal answer to your question.It usually started with exposure to people that were supposedly telling her an alternative \"real\" truth. The cycle is always the same. She gets involved, sucked in, doesn't think critically (ie \"it agrees with how I feel!\"), and then gets layered on top of a core failure of the ability to weight ambiguous information by its actual probability. Now don't get me wrong, those intuitive leaps of logic aren't themselves to blame, it's not using them properly and getting far too invested while ignoring any contradictory information.So all of a sudden she's thinking about X, and therefore everything and anything becomes about X. That's how human psychology works, but she thinks the intuitive answer must be the right answer and ignores that hyperfixation skews your perception and causes connections to be made that might not represent some greater truth. A basic part of how the brain works that I realized before I was even 5, and actively exploited to allow for more rapid learning. But no. \"You don't get it\" \"You just don't have the intuition, and the knowing I do.\"tl;drMeets the wrong people. Believes them, because their explanation explains something or plays the right way on ambiguity. Cuts ties with people eventually, because even she gets sick of their shit. Keeps artifacts of the belief systems herself, only now she's made it her own. Refuses contradictory information because she uses all the wrong things to anchor her reasoning to. Doesn't listen to me because I'm an object of her dislike for my father, and more importantly, a mirror. A proxy to her own insecurities. ", " >>7677812I ran out of characters, but the most important part is, she argues with other people and readily recognizes their beliefs as unsubstantiated and faith based. She sees them as placing faith in authority. She knows \"something\" is happening, and it must be this, or that. Coincidence line up, and I imagine, given that she knows nothing about chemistry or physics, it begins o seem far more likely that her present explanation is the right one. It's more convenient.I think genetics plays a role. Naturally, we're relatively aggressive people when it comes to people trying to say how it is, or what to do. She just lacks the judgement to create an accurate or well balanced framework of beliefs. She doesn't have, or want, the knowledge, because it quickly becomes hazy and uncertain the moment you know anything. It's easier with an enemy, even if it's an unknown one. You've still got that goddamn enemy, if you can just figure out who, what, and how it works.

And if you could just fix \"it\", everything that stemmed from it, could also be fixed. A grand tree of dependencies. The thought that if you could just reconcile the core problem, it would all be fixed. It's a dislike for the complexity of the real world, and the notion that there's a buried one true truth causing it all. An underlying feature that can be dragged into the open.Anyway, last addition, there's definitely a lot to be said. But this aspect is probably at work in some capacity.

This is the hardest step.Also, you need around 100 healthy 20-ish male human test subjects. And a complete lack of ethics.1. Muscles:Injecting the best-fitting steroid in every major muscle group, around 1 or 2 times a week, while pushing the subjects through rough military training (e.g. DEVGRU, ST6, etc.). See /k/ and/or /fit/ for more info about that. Also, feed the subjects well. 2. Stamina:EPO. Period. Combine it with the steroids, see above. 3. Self-healing:Let\u00b4s just assume you extracted a concentrated juice from the Axolotl\u00b4s wounds. Let\u00b4s also just say you know how to apply it.It should amplify your subjects ability for self-healing. Combine it with the stuff above.4. Mind:Trainig and numbing is essential. For this, expose your subjects to prolonged episodes of WWI-like scenarios,e.g. mud, excrements, decaying (pig) corpses, constant artillery fire, faked executions, etc.The key to a peak human mind is also the constant use of small doses of Modafinil (Provigil) and Methylphenidate/Amphetamin.Together with the constant training it will sharpen the focus.

Final surgeries:Here, you\u00b4re gonna have to use the metallic nano-powder (Titanium fits best). Inject it in the main bones. Also in the rest. When constructed correctly, it should bond to the calcium structure and harden it.Also, put a fixed katheter in a main artery.

With time I'm sure deep brain stimulation implants like you suggest in step 6 can be possibly to guide behavior in some way.

An antagonist blocks the action that normally results from the binding of a transmitter to a particular receptor.

That way you can determine where the transmitters are and what they are. ", " >>7664517>>7667640While the yahoo answer suffices, I dont know how much detail you are required to go into.In a lab setting, they would most likely use a FRET = Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. Basically you take 2 proteins (that you think interact. In this case if you use an agonist for epinephrine binding to beta-adrenergic receptor, then you will see the the receptor go through a conformation change and dissociate from its trimeric G-protein. Then the trimeric G-protein will associate with Adenylyl cyclase (AC). So you would use the FRET on say the receptor + the trimeric G protein or maybe the trimeric G-protein and AC.How the FRET works is that you excite the first protein you have the FP bound to which will emit in a certain color (usually green but you get to pick), This color will only emit when the protein is dissociated from the other protein as it will only emit a certain wavelength.If the protein is associated with the other FP, then it will emit another color (Red) - because you excite at a certain frequency and the 2nd protein is made so that when the first protein is excited and emits a wavelength, the second protein absorbs that wavelength and emits its own of a different color (the 2nd one absorbs the green and emits red).Anyways, this allows you to see the signal activation clearly. In the case of epinephrine, say you setup a FRET with the trimeric G-proteins and AC. If there is association that looks like a bell curve. Then that is the epinephrine agonist working. If there is no association and it is just a flat graph, then there is the antagonist. It would essentially look like this graph. With the upward trend being the point where you added the agonist. And then the peak being where you removed the agonist. If it were an antagonist then nothing would happen and would see a flat line (because the trimeric G-protein never dissociates from the receptor and binds with AC).

Unfortunately these nested games are designed in such a way that they're directly connected to grinding. They also do not stand alone as games themselves.Typically in an MMORPG these individual games each have a reward like a power up, an item, a resource, an unlockable, etc... So it is a little bit more natural to refer to each game as a reward.Typically each reward is designed so that it falls in a sequence of rewards, each separated by a similar amount of grinding. For instance>grind for 1 hour>get reward>grind for 1 hour>get reward>etc..This is the carrot and stick approach to game design. The player is compelled to keep playing under the induced belief that they're constantly \"just an hour away\" from the next reward. Eventually the player stops seeing the nested games as the real goal of the game and starts seeing grinding as the goal of the game. If you look at some other games like Clash of Clans or Farmville then you've got a similar scenario except the player actually loses invested time and resources by not playing. The player isn't just compelled to play, they're penalized if they don't.I don't consider MMORPGs to be proper games for this reason.

Every time an atom of your bullet impacts with an earth atom, the energy is so high both atoms are simply torn apart into sub atomic particles.

All the momentum goes into the reaction products of the nuclear interaction.Now these sub-atomic particles go ripping thru the earth at nearly light speed, and now there is really no stopping them. Their relative cross section is so small, the earth is basically transparent. Even the ones who do interact, its singular atomic interactions spread throughout the bulk of the earth.Even if you took ALL the atoms in the bullet, and said every single one of them will strike another atom dead on and cause an atomic fission, its just not that much energy that is going to be captured by the earth.

Let just say I am very certain speed destroys stuff. One of my insane weapon designs uses 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 helium atom and a few photons carrying way too much energy. When these things interact under a set of specific conditions the energy can transmute into more hydrogen atoms with a lot of energy. The idea is the shot is fired with a calculated decay till the conditions are met. At which point you get a odd type of nuclear explosion where a mass of highly energized hydrogen suddenly starts to appear. This cloud spreads following a typical cone shape maximizing the area of effect. And well you can imagine the damage of an expanding cloud of high energy hydrogen moving near the speed of light can do once it hit the upper atmosphere. Not as much energy as a more typical large mass relativistic kill weapon at first glance, but the sudden compression would trigger a lot more secondary nuclear reaction in any lighter element based atmosphere planet. Want to see what happens when about 5% of the earth atmosphere suddenly under goes nuclear fusion? It makes the weapon harder to detect and uses less energy as the secondary nuclear reactions boost it. Bonus points if the atmospheric displacement triggers a slow decaying orbit into the local star. This is why I am not allowed to design any new weapons. It is not enough to nuke a planet from orbit when do that, and nuke it inside an active star.

Males have a penis and females have a vagina.Gender is a social construct based on the biological dichotomy of sex. Humans take physical features and ascribe meaning and (sometimes faulty) reasoning to them. For example, men are biologically stronger than women. Humans then take this to a symbolic level, to be a man is to be strong and to be a woman is to be weak, regardless of the massive amount of actual variance in physical strength among individuals. Then it is taken further, any other traits that are associated with women are also associated with weakness and traits associated with men are often associated with strength. There is nothing inherently weak about crying, a strongman who suppresses his emotion is still just as physically strong, only he's been conditioned by society to endanger himself by not allowing himself to express his emotions in a healthy way. There is nothing in male biology that makes them less likely to cry, it is pure conditioning due to the subjective fabrication of what male and female is 'supposed' to be.Another example. Women tend to carry more possessions with them in their daily life than men do. This can be biologically motivated, as women require more hygienic maintenance than men and would be more likely to carry hygienic products with them, as well as socially motivated, as women tend to place greater value on their appearance than men and often carry cosmetics. Because of this, women carry purses, and over time purses came to be seen not simply as a bags to carry possessions but as an innately feminine item. Men do not carry purses, and when they carry bags with them they choose other types of bags to carry their items, never a purse because it is considered a wholly female item. There is nothing in the design of the modern purse that lends itself more to female biology than male, it is given its feminine designation artificially.

It means that gender is subjective and can be defined from many different metrics. Further, you seem to lack understanding of the difference between sex and gender, as these are not synonymous terms. Sex refers to the biological and physical differences between males and females. Gender refers to appearance, behaviors and roles that humans are expected to conform to because of their sex, or because of what others perceive their sex to be.What is the 'true' metric of man and women? Chromosomes? Genitals? Secondary sex characteristics? These are all non-rigid classifications that can at times conflict.

And a female may have a greater disposition to hold feminine traits. >Is gender primarily conditioned rather than biological?There's a biological blueprint that holds the potential of an individual. External stimuli poke and prod at the way we view these potential densities, creating the perception of a general shape of our gender identity. Eventually, those densities could shift by the way those traits are perceived. As a male, one could have loud feminine traits and discouraged masculine traits. Eventually after separating one's perspective from those undesired masculine traits, one would more easily identify as female because those traits are \"louder\" and allowed by the perspective. But because those masculine traits are resisted against, they're still very active because one is focused on resisting them. ", " >>7634875No, the concept you're thinking of is self-control. Holding in tears in public has logical benefits. You can preserve your appearance, status, or influence to others, as well prevent others from being negatively emotionally influenced by you. This does not in any way make crying a weakness, as a human you have the ability to find ways to outlet your emotions in a constructive way. A woman who cries on her friends shoulder can outlet her emotions as well as strengthen the emotional bond between her and her friend. A man could benefit from these things as well, but is not allowed to by society. When a man cries he is far more likely to be shamed, which makes him internalize the notion the crying is unacceptable. This makes him more likely to carry emotional burdens, more likely to turn to dangerous outlets to cope with these emotions such as alcohol or violence, and ultimately more likely to develop mental illness or commit suicide.

Gender is very firmly rooted in genetic sexes. People often use the term \"social construct\" when they want to behave differently to what society is used to and they don't want to be derided for it. This is fine in itself, many of the behaviours are in fact social constructs and they don't have to be, I would agree to that. The problem is that many behaviours also have a very firm genetic basis. Why we don't often use women as front line troops for example. Why health professions are female dominated. Why engineering is a male dominated profession. It just don't see why everything HAS to be exactly 50/50 just \"gender behaviours are social constructs [based on the biological dichotomy of sex]\".

", " >>7633268Since the OP is actually coherent, and the text and image both pose a few simple questions, let's take OP's /b/-tier question at face value.We are presented with a series on the RHS which the OP was kind enough to specify as a specific /kind/ of series, an /arithmetic/ series; this invalidates the cute reply of >>7633277 (where otherwise it might have been applicable). So (making an assumption) we begin with 3, and each successive term is equal to the previous term, plus four. This can be defined recursively with the above initial condition and a specification S_{k+1} = S_{k} + 4 for natural k, with S_{0} = 3. Or better yet, since (4(g+1) +3) - (4g+3 ) = 4, we can say that the gth term in the series is given by S_{g} = 4g + 3 for natural g, (again with S_{0}= 3). By closure, each term is always odd (even times anything is even, even plus odd is odd), so we consider a series of odd numbers of the form (4g+2)+1 = 2(2g+1)+1, which is just the form that an odd number must be capable of being rewritten as (which it is, being thus by definition odd). The next natural questions are a) whether the above series does in fact sum to 1830 for some finite series of terms, b) if so, how many terms are involved, and c) if not, what are the closest numbers of terms in the related series. Since the proposed sum is even, we require an even number of terms, for if there are an odd number of terms, then we shall have an odd sum, which is absurd. And since there must be an even number of terms to be found, the series must be amenable to strict expression as pairs of terms - smallest plus largest, added to second smallest plus second largest, etc, with no middle man left out. This just takes the \"add 1-100\" story (attributed to Gauss) and applies it to a like finite series. ", " >>7633344What (according to the story) did Gauss do? We just said: he rearranged an even number of terms in a finite series /not merely as another series/, but rather as a simple multiplication. And this, because each rearranged term is equal (1+100, 2+99, etc). ThusThis equality will hold good in our case since we also have complementary arithmetic progression of like terms. The trick is that, not knowing either of h (multiplier, like 50) or 4n+6 (multiplicand, like 101) immediately, we are forced to brute force for a moment, and think. Also note that since we begin here with g=0, as an indexing issue, take care that n itself is odd, and we concern ourself with n+1 (an even number) of terms. Gauss' problem had the advantage that both were given nigh-explicitly in the series to be evaluated; here we just have them algebraically.Set h = (n+1) / 2 and plug in per Gauss' form; this leads to a quadratic in n which is equal to 1830, and re-arrangement gives a quadratic equation one of whose roots is discarded as a negative as a (real) negative number, and what remains is that n = 29.A check is simple: the result can be more explicitly rephrased as:Where both multiplier and multiplicand are now given explicitly. Here we have fifteen pairs of (3+119, 7+ 115), etc.To answer your question in more general terms OP (in a mathematical fashion like this, instead of trial-and-error) required the quadratic formula, a bit of number theory, and a knowledge of Gauss' apocryphal (?) problem.

So there's no easy rule you can use to generate a nice stable planetary system - all you can do is try and make sure it's not about to go anywhere at this moment. Also, planetary atmosphere composition turns out to be super difficult, because the processes by which planets lose gases over time are complex and poorly understood, and how they got the initial supply of gas is even more vague and speculative, and the way things like volcanism and life replenish or cycle gases is even more complicated.You can't even tell how thick of an atmosphere a planet can hold from its mass and radius, because it all depends dramatically on many other factors - which gives you smaller-than-Earth, more-Sun-exposed Venus having a dramatically thicker atmosphere than Earth, while Mars has such a thin one, and tiny Titan has its own dense pea soup.

I.e. no Hot Jupiter systems. I basically only generate classical systems, Sol like ones.I then use the logarithmic spacings, and finally make sure no two orbits are within 0.15 AU of each other.I might move on to other systems later on, but as you said, they're very complex, and there's no easy way to figure out the distribution and rules for them.And about the details of the planets, I realize just that, so for now I left them with just a name, and a distance.>>7607621I realize most of the code is really messy, but I just wanted something out quickly that worked. Check line 224 if you want to see a real monster. I'm not sure *I* even understand how it works.Also, does your example not just set discrete masses? Could an O star have a mass of say, 23 solar masses in that code? ", " >>7607633Ah, you're right.Perhaps something like this:mass = [50,16,2.1,1.4,1.04,0.8,0.45,0.08,0]starmass = random.uniform(mass[index+1],mass[index]) ", " >>7607642Duly noted. I will rewrite the code to something much more neat (and hopefully quicker!) when the proof of concept is done. I tried bumping up the number of systems from 1000 to 300000 and I've been sitting here for about 5 minutes and it *just* hit 1% on the writing to file part, which takes the longest by far.I did have some \"Out of memory\" issues earlier when I tried generating ~1 billion systems, but I *think* they just occur in the generating stars part of the process, so right now I just have to play the waiting game. ", " >>7607657You could also try numba and jit. It's still got some issues but it might help you. ", " >>7607657what's your process memory size? you might be killing yourself trying to hold all those stars in memory at the same time ", " >>7607670I could just write the statistics to file instantly, and not keep an array of all the star objects, and planet objects, but if I do that I won't be able to do other stuff with them later, since they won't be in memory. ", " >>7607681is there a way you could summarize the key statistics you need for later, without storing the entire object? ", " >>7607590>You can't even tell how thick of an atmosphere a planet can hold from its mass and radius, because it all depends dramatically on many other factors - which gives you smaller-than-Earth, more-Sun-exposed Venus having a dramatically thicker atmosphere than Earth, while Mars has such a thin one, and tiny Titan has its own dense pea soup.Venus has a denser atmosphere because it is mostly CO2 while earth's is mostly N2. CO2 is heavier and thus easier to hold onto. Meanwhile all of Earth's CO2 is trapped in the liquid oceans, something Venus never had because of it's proximity to the Sun. As for Mars, the effect is even more drastic. The CO2 is trapped in the rock because it isn't geologically active, but mainly the atmosphere is non existent because it's tiny. Titan is tiny too, but it's SO much farther out, the temperature is too cold for its atmosphere to reach escape velocity. You're right, there are a lot more factors than just radius and mass, there's mass, surface temperature, gas composition and evolution of the greenhouse or icehouse effects. A general rule of thumb for astronomers is that the surface temperature needed for a gas to reach escape velocity is (GMm)/(54kR). The surface temperature on a planet is T*(R/2D)^.5*(1-a)^.25. These do not take into account the greenhouse affect, but as we know from Venus as the temperature increases the planet releases more gas, and less overall are able to reach escape velocity. ", " >>7607633aren't hot jupiter's the most common of the gas giants? Also, binary systems are fairly common as well. What exactly are you planning to use this code for? ", " >>7607705Sure, but working out atmosphere values a priori is still stupid hard. I do understand thermal escape, since it's the only one with a nice formula, although as far as I can tell the value that matters is how hot the exosphere is, not the surface temperature.It's easy to tell \"Can this planet hold this gas at this temperature?\" but much harder to tell \"How much of this gas is this planet going to hold?\" ", " >>7607705Now generalize it. That's the issue at hand, and I think that was what he was trying to say.>>7607702Right now the memory really isn't an issue. In fact I could make due with just the mass and name of the star, since literally everything else is generated from there on. The real problem I'm having is execution time, and \"decompressing\" those stats later would just add to that. But in theory you could bump up the number of stars that you hold in memory maybe even 10 times by just storing mass and name, but you'll probably increase execution time 10-fold as well.To be clear, it's just the writing to the file that takes time. In fact I can easily generate a couple hundred of millions of systems in under a minute. For example generating a system and writing only G-star systems with gas giants should go really quickly. ", " >>7607714Yes and yes. I will implement them later, I'd do it now if I could find some statistics on the distribution of those systems. I.e. how many systems out of a 1000 will be hot jupiters, how many will be binaries, etc.And I don't really plan to necessarily use the code for anything, I just like worldbuilding and emergent behavior. ", " >>7607717Actually the real problem that I found, is that for every star it literally checks EVERY planet created. Which is a huge problem for execution time. ", " >>7607718I can't really source any statistics but from what I remember more than half of high mass stars are in binary systems, and the vast majority of M stars are single. So I'd do something like 80% of O stars, 70% B, 60% A, 50% F, 40% G, 20% K, and 5% M will be apart of a binary or multi-star system. I'm not sure exactly the best way to write a code for creating binary systems, but I have an idea as to how you should go about it. you randomly pair together n stars from that pool of percentages, and any integer n as a (n*e^-n)*100 percent chance of being chosen each loop. This almost adds to 100%, and it makes sense because the chance for a system with 3 stars is exponentially lower than for a system with 2 stars. ", " And here's a new and improved version! Fixed the horrible inefficient planet checking when writing to file, and this one takes me about 1 minute to generate 300K systems, as opposed to 5 minutes to get 1% of the way.pastebin.com/yKw3xjD8 ", " >>7607304>OBAFGKM>Not ABCDEFG>\"Everyone should use metric cos it's more logical!\" ", " >>7607877Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me ", " Final bump before I go to bed.Tomorrow I'll work on binary systems, as well as diving into fleshing out the planets. ", " >>7607948Fine Goy ", " >>7607877>ABCDEFGA Boy Can Detest Even Fine Girls ", " >>7607877I know this is a joke, but the order of the letters corresponds to the strength of the most prominent hydrogen absorption line in the spectrum. A-stars have the strongest absorption line because O and B stars are so hot that the line is partially obscured. Some of the letters in the ordinary alphabetic sequence (like C, D, E) are missing from star classification either because they were eventually combined with other categories, or because they were reserved for later use by Annie Jump Cannon and the rest and never ended up being used.In modern times, the alphabetical-order classification was reorganized into OBAFGKM when the relationship between spectral type, temperature, and mass was discovered. Thus, O stars are the most massive, B stars are the next most massive, A stars are next after that (even though they had the strongest absorption lines, which prompted them to be named \"A\" in the first place), etc. etc. ", " >>7607304A better seed for your systems would be to use an Initial Mass Function, a mathematical relationship that describes the proportion of mass bound up in stars of different masses at the birth of a population of stars. You can then use rules about the lifetimes of stars as a function of their mass to evolve the population over time.This is useful, because in reality you will never find a compact neighborhood of space that has the distribution of spectral types shown in your table. That table is an average over all classified stars, but in reality stars are born in groups, and age together with their groups. So in some directions we see lots of big stars in addition to medium sized stars and little stars, because we are looking at a young population in which the biggest stars haven't yet died. In other directions, we see mostly little stars because we are looking at very old populations, and only the smallest stars are still burning.White dwarves, neutron stars, and black holes are the remnants of \"dead\" stars, so you wouldn't see a lot of white dwarves in the same place as, for example, a population that still has its O stars, unless there were multiple different populations that had been born at different times in your field of view. ", " >>7609353I don't see how the IMF would help me do that though. It just seems to give me a distribution of stars. I'm looking at the Kroupa version for reference. ", " >>7609440Isn't that what you want to know? If I say \"stars consisting of a total of 1 million solar masses were born in this cluster,\" the IMF tells you either how much mass is contained in stars of a given mass, or, equivalently through a simple transformation, how many stars of a given mass I should expect to observe. ", " Cool work anon ", " >>7609537But would that not just give me the same results as using the distribution in the OP pic?If not, I'd gladly use the IMF instead. I have to admit I'm not 100% comfortable with the notation though, so if you'd offer an explanation that would be great. ", " >>7609732>But would that not just give me the same results as using the distribution in the OP picNo. The OP pic shows the observed fraction of different spectral classes of stars as they exist right now. Those stars were not all born at the same time. In general, all the stars near each other were born in one period of history, so they are all approximately the same age. A population of stars that are all the same age looks different depending on what age that is. A population that is five billion years old will have hardly any stars at all that are much brighter than our Sun, let alone gigantic O stars. But, that same population when it was only a hundred million years old will have every type of star, because their largest and brightest stars are still alive!

I got a B, and it was a huge amount of work (I measured bacterial colony sizes every two days by microscope for 2 months over the summer). I had to make large compromises in my write-up which reflected poorly on my grade.So my tip to you is, remember that the grade is based on your write-up, not your actual researchy bit. So try to minimize the amount of time spent researching and spend the time you saved on writing a good essay. Don't be hell-bent on doing it in physics unless you already have that locked in.You could use the method of exact fractions to estimate some quantity to a high degree of accuracy.

However, you have a green and a blue laser pointer, so you can send him signals. (Notation: 0 means blinking once with the blue pointer, 1 means blinking once with the green one.)Your strategy is to send him what the pixels look like, one after the other, and to get some accuracy, you will send him a 4 color version of the pic. You agree on the colors orange, red, white and black. Say the pic is about one half orange, one quarter red, 1/8'th white and 1/8'th black.How to send him 4 different options with two different signals, though? Well the first and obvious idea is this: Each color is two encoded by two blinks, and 00 is orange, 01 is red, 10 is white and 11 is black. Each pixed takes you 2 blinks. You can blink 2\u00b7100\u00b7100 = 20000 times and then he has your pic!(cont.) ", " (cont.)Not too bad, but 20 year old Shannon would think you can do better: Since most of the image is orange, say orange is just one blue blink, 0, that saves time. But okay, now you can't use the code \"01\" anymore, since after the first of the blinks, your friend will think you've sent him an orange pixel. What you will do is make 10 into the second most often color, red, and finally make 110 and 111 into white and black. Okay, how many blinks does the average pixel take?(1/2)\u00b71 + (1/4)\u00b72 + (1/8)\u00b73 + (1/8)\u00b73 = 7/4 = 1.75Ha! This encoding saved you 12.5% of your time! That's in fact the best you can do. If x is the fraction of occurrence of one color, note that the length of the color in the optimized version is always log_2(1/x). For example, x=1/8, log_2(1/x)=log_2(8)=3.If p is the probability of occurrence, then I(p)=log(1/p) is the information. The entropy is defined as the expectation value of the information, the sum over the different messages of p\u00b7I(p), i.e. the sum I computed above. Information theory says that optimizing the entropy is optimizing the encoding.The logarithm enters the picture here, because probability for composite systems is obtained by multiplying the probability for the occurrence of their subsystems, while the information (and the energy in physics), is defined to be an additive quantity. The homo from addition to multiplication is the exponential functione^(n+m) = e^n\u00b7e^mFor any item with occurrence rate x, its \"price\" or energy is x\u00b7log_2(1/x)=-log_2(x^x). This function has its maximum at x=1/e=0.367...i.e. after optimization of your system, the pixels of your message will give the worst entropy contribution if their occurrence rate is about 37%. The information content of a pixel with this rate is log_2(1(1/e)) = 1/log(2), seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_%28unit%29Morally, sending the red pixels (1/4 is closest to 1/e) will bore you the most. They make quite a bit of your image and take you two blinks. ", " You don't need implicit derivatives for it.

Introducing it to the market, earning billions of dollars and sending all the other companies to bankrupt within months2. Keeping it in the dark, paying millions to the people who developed it (since that's easily what they'll make if they go public with it), while competing hard with the other companies to make a profit?Economy isn't a science, but if you want to make conspiracy theories they need to hold up.Now, since I actually work in that field, I'm going to throw a little bone for conspiracy people. Many people would agree that it may be easier to get big funds for works developing better medications for chronic diseases than for possible cures. A common explanation is just people being very critical of such cures, as they've all failed so far, but another possible explanation is that it's better for the larger companies not to invest in this.I don't really buy it, but at least it's a more plausible conspiracy theory than what you presented. ", " >>7307458>Let's assume a company has a cure for T1D, what would be wiser?>1.

Keeping it in the dark, paying millions to the people who developed it (since that's easily what they'll make if they go public with it), while competing hard with the other companies to make a profit?Option 1 is not as attractive as it may seem. Sure, if you develop a cure for a disease and you are first to market, you're going to make bank. But what happens when the patent expires? The cure goes generic, loses it's massive profitability and essentially halts research and development for that disease because it's been cured. If you've built your business around treating that disease, your business model goes the way of the dinosaur. It's not necessarily corruption or conspiracy. Business will chase after products that are profitable. Why isn't big pharma going nuts on cannabis research when it's been shown to have serious disease treating potential? Probably because you can't get a patent on a plant that already exists and what good is trying to develop a new drug that someone could grow in their backyard for a few dollars instead of having to buy it from a pharmacy? Again, it's not conspiracy. It's just business acting in a way to make themselves more profitable. They are not going to shoot themselves in the foot. ", " >>7307513Undoubtfully so, that's why I find the option I offered somewhat plausible (not funding research).But hiding a cure doesn't make financial sense, since it doesn't just \"make bank\", it breaks a market. Most companies lose, but the companies getting into the market easily makes its worth in profits, which is an unfathomable amount of money. And as for diabetes, it's a fairly common chronic disease and you will keep getting \"new\" patients naturally.As for the cannabis, I haven't seen any results that convinced me yet. Have you seen any proper study where it was even statistically significant? ", " >>7305840I had to think about this long and hard. Insurance companies don't really care how much stuff costs. If healthcare prices go up, they just adjust their premiums so they are still profitable. And now that all US citizens are required by law to buy health insurance, how worried do you think they are that you will just stop paying for health insurance because it's too expensive? (The answer is not at all). Although competition should in theory make it so they can't charge you like a million dollars for a premium. (You could go to a different company) ", " >>7307545>As for the cannabis, I haven't seen any results that convinced me yet. Have you seen any proper study where it was even statistically significant?Oh my yes. There are so many studies I can't keep track of them all. You need to spend some time googling this stuff. Some of the ones I recall of the top of my head are: cannabis being a neuroprotectant, having strong antioxidant properties, being a good epilepsy treatment, in petri dishes it can kill certain types of cancer cells while leaving normal cells intact, it can reduce inflammation, helps relief the pain from glaucoma, etc. Seriously, start web searching this stuff. Cannabis has a lot of potential. To many who've studied it, we find it's Schedule I status to be laughable and I personally find it to be an insult to human rights. Here's one for you:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264643Effect of marijuana use on outcomes in traumatic brain injury....\"Overall mortality was 9.9 per cent (44); however, mortality in the THC(+) group (2.4% [two]) was significantly decreased compared with the THC(-) group (11.5% [42]; P = 0.012). After adjusting for differences between the study cohorts on logistic regression, a THC(+) screen was independently associated with survival after TBI (odds ratio, 0.224; 95% confidence interval, 0.051 to 0.991; P = 0.049). A positive THC screen is associated with decreased mortality in adult patients sustaining TBI (traumatic brain injury).\" ", " Cannabis has been shown in many studies to reduce the size of some types of tumors. And another:http://m.mct.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2014/11/12/1535-7163.MCT-14-0402.abstractThe Combination of Cannabidiol and \u03949-Tetrahydrocannabinol Enhances the Anticancer Effects of Radiation in an Orthotopic Murine Glioma Model\"These in vitro results were recapitulated in an orthotopic murine model for glioma, which showed dramatic reductions in tumor volumes when both cannabinoids were used with irradiation (day 21: 5.5 \u00b1 2.2 mm3 vs. 48.7 \u00b1 24.9 mm3 in the control group; P < 0.01). Taken together, our data highlight the possibility that these cannabinoids can prime glioma cells to respond better to ionizing radiation, and suggest a potential clinical benefit for glioma patients by using these two treatment modalities.\" ", " >>7307597>>7307626Interesting, I don't have time to review it in full, but the second one actually looks interesting. It does seem to follow all the basic rules cannabis studies like to ignore (even basic things like no conflicts of interest declaration). Two issues obviously immediately jump to mind: using a very high concentrations of THC, and showing damage to cancerous cells and cell cycle, rather than specificity to those cells alone for one. The design is also non-existent (what is the control here? do you think that suffices for proof?) which is obviously the main problem. I am also not clear on the statistically significant results, since they don't expound much on the statistical analysis, but most results actually don't seem to be significant, which is a shame.Even with those issues in mind, it seems to be a pretty good work for investigating a possible mechanism. Very premature and doesn't prove much, but it does show a likelyhood of a cytostatic/cytotoxic mechanism induced by THC and CBD combined, and elaborates on that nicely.Now to go from this to therapeutic use is a long long way. Most medicine take 20 years to go from this stage to therapeutic use, and most fall in the way (there's a reason it's so rigorous).Maybe the first article is better ,I don't have time even to skim through it, I'm sorry, But I'm generally skeptical of Am Surg., their peer review is terrible (often residents barely related to the subjects), and they publish a lot of crap.Sadly, I don't have time to properly read any of these papers, but I recommend you approach them critically.

When you ask for a job you have to present your immunization record.Thanks to that we don't have people dying of preventable diseases even when 40% of the population live in Africa tier conditions, people here get scared of the second effects a vaccine has but you only have to explain them once why those happen.Honestly, it baffles my mind how Americans are so afraid of vaccines, claiming we are still in the 60s using pure mercury in them, that they have drugs and chemicals in them, that the big evil pharma try to control you or get max bucks of you (vaccines don't generate that much income m8), cherry picking cases where the vaccine killed somebody or it caused a huge overreaction, hey guess what? That is called idiosyncrasy, the vaccine you use is used worldwide, you can dig up 1000 but what are those compared to the millions who took the same vaccine and nothing happened to them?Now, somebody explain to me how this mindset is born.

Antibiotics are usually the first way to go because sore throats are usually caused as a byproduct of bacterial infections. However, if it persists, other causes could be behind it, like an infection from a latent virus in your system or bile rising to your esophagus and making it raw enough to open it to easy infection.If it persists, just see the doctor again, and s/he'll give you another prescription. They usually tell you to see them again if symptoms persist, so just take that and go with it. If you want some easy and cheap pain relief, get some warm salt water and gurgle it as far down in your throat as you can before spitting it out. If you can, gurgle until a little bit of loogie comes out because snot is generally used by your body to encase dead bacteria and remove it from your system.Then, there's the usual stuff that's just good practice. Drink orange juice. Have ice cold water otherwise, and have a little bit of it in your mouth for every bite so it goes down easier. Snack on applesauce.

On top of that, each of them know there are at least n-1 cheating wives.So for any k in {1,..n}, k-non reasons thusly:\"For every i in {1,..n}, i=!k, i-non is a cuck and knows n-2 cheating wives if my wife is a boring non-cheating bitch, n-1 cheating wives if my wives is a cheating slut bitch.Since each of them is able to reason as I'm doing, each of them can wait to see if one of us kills his wife. Let m be the number of cheating wifes each of them know. They'll wait m days, to see if another man kills his wife, and no wife will be killed for those m days. Then, at day m+1, they'll realize there is at least one cheating wife they don't know is cheating, and that must be ther wife, so they'll kill her. Therefore, if a wife is killed at exactly day n-1, then m=n-2, which means each of the cucks knows n-2 cheating wives, so there are n-1 cheating wives, which means my wife isn't cheating and is a boring bitch.Conversely, if no wife is killed until day n-1 included, then m>=n-1, which means there are at least n cheating wives, which means there's at least one cheating wife I don't know, and that must be my wife, which is then a cheating bitch, and I'll kill her at day n.\"So, all unfaithful wives killed at day 9 means 9 unfaithful wives.

", " Post 1/2?So, first off, we have to talk about what it means to extract roots from a polynomial, then I'm going to talk a little bit about groups, and then I'm going to combine these two ideas. For these purposes, I'm going to use the term polynomial meaning \"Polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients.\"The rational numbers form what's called a field, as in, by just using finite amounts of addition, subtraction and multiplication, you can't obtain a element not in the rational numbers. Now, you'll be the first to point out that there are certainly polynomials with whose roots aren't in the rational numbers. An excellent example of this is . It turns out that you can make new fields by just tacking on roots of polynomials to the rational numbers (it's more complex than this, but you get the idea). These are called field extensions.There's an idea of a minimal field extension for each polynomial, called a splitting field. A polynomial's splitting field is where the only elements tacked onto the rationals are its roots.Now, there's a really interesting phenomenon that goes on with these splitting fields. There are special functions that preserve the structure of the field, but switch around the roots (For example, such a function might send  to . These functions are called automorphisms. Automorphisms form what is called a group. Specifically, the group of all automorphisms on a splitting field is called the Galois group. ", " >>7273285Now, what the fundamental theorem of Galois theory says is that this Galois group encodes a lot of information about the splitting fields of polynomials. Specifically (as a corollary), the Galois group has a certain property (called solvability) if and only if the polynomials can be solved by a finite amount of algebraic manipulations (I'm sorry if this is handwavy, but I'm trying to keep this very fundamental, I can try to explain this part in another post if you need me to). Now, it turns out that for finite groups (which is what we're dealing with, according to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory), this solvability property is based on how many elements a group has. That is, if a group only has a handful of elements, it's more likely to be solvable if it only has a handful of elements.This is to say, I can have more cool structures in a group with a lot of elements than in a group with only a few. It turns out that sort of the minimum size for a group with this property happens to be 5!/2, which happens to also be the size of the galois group for the splitting field of a general quintic polynomial.Anyway, that may have been utterly unsatisfying, but that's the basic idea behind Galois theory. The issue is that the theorems involved are a rare combination nonsense and extreme power that makes them difficult to talk about on an intuitive level. ", " >>7273302I'm not an algebraist (I study categorical semantics), but your post really piqued my interest. I've had Galois theory on my list of things to study for some time now, but it honestly sounds far more approachable than I expected. ", " >>7273302>>7273285Very interesting stuff. Thanks for taking the time to post this.You're the kind of person who keeps 4chan alive. ", " >>7273313I'm not really sure what that field entails, to be honest. If you haven't had Galois theory, you're probably coming from a CS background, in which case you probably know what a ring, a group and a field is. You could probably pretty reasonably grab any undergraduate book and just read the chapters on Galois theory and field extensions and get away with it. The only hard theorem/concept is the fundamental theorem, but even that isn't unapproachable.

I have studied a good deal of commutative algebra and am trying to learn algebraic geometry on my free time, so I think I am fairly well-equipped on the algebraic side of things.

Instead names are only necessary for communicating ideas efficientlyI agree with this, and I've noticed that same observation: Words seem peripheral to thought, defining thought more loosely as something like \"cognitive activity\" to distinguish it from verbalized thought in the form of language.Similarly, you may sometimes notice that you have an idea, a solution to a puzzle, an answer to a question that you have in your mind, but that you can't quite find a good wording for. You KNOW what you want to say, you've got this complex cognitive object sitting there, but you don't have the exact words for it yet. I think it is possible for such a thing to occur because verbalized thought as language is secondary, mapped onto deeper cognition which is non-verbal or at least not necessarily verbal. This second observation addresses this question, then: >>7239259As a linguist (or rather a linguistics grad student) I don't believe that it can be the case that language determines thought because even though languages have many different ways of expressing things and not every language does everything similarly, all languages have approximately the same usefulness in expression. For example, there are many languages that do not grammatically distinguish past/present/future, but rather have a simpler distinction between past versus non-past. (our beloved Moonspeak is one such language) Does this mean they conceive of present and future as the same somehow? Fuck no, it's just that if specific present or future reference needs to be distinguished (and often context alone is sufficient) slightly more complexity is needed. But it isn't as if Japanese speakers are worse than English speakers at conceiving of events in terms of past/present/future, their grammar simply approaches it differently.

While I don't know what it's like in other people's minds, anecdotally pre-verbal thought and verbalized thought are generally so intertwined that it seems difficult to say much about them in isolation and quantify what exactly each can do.

One may recognize that this is practically equivalent to never...\" ", " >>7234142>Implying Statistical mechanics isn't just a more rigorous Thermodynamics ", " >>7233941Here's a more concrete example. Imagine the \"universe\" is a collection of a hundred indostinguishable coins on the table. Every second, you randomly select a coin, flip it, and put it back. The second law for this system would state:>\"As time proceeds, the number of heads approaches the number of tails regardless of initial conditions\"So, even though there's a chance your random flipping would cause you to reach a state of all heads, that's incredibly unlikely, as there's so many more states near equality than near almost all heads.

So can you really assume that your system behave randomly?>One should not imagine that two gases in a .1 liter containerYeah, whot about ten atoms in an 1 \u03bcl container?To hit the spot: do you believe a perpetual motion machine of the second kind may be theoretically possibel? What are the changes? Why? ", " >>7234181see>>7234196The question is: Can you always and for all systems assume, that \"the coins flip completly condomly and independently\"? ", " The second law is a macroscopic effect which can be derived from microscopic quantities. The field in which this is studied is called statistical mechanics. In a classical sense, it can be temporarily violated, in the same way that energy conservation can be temporarily violated through tunnelling. But in a complete process, it can not.This isn't surprising. Keep in mind that temperature doesn't make sense on a microscopic scale, either. The speed of light isn't constant over sufficiently short distances. Distance and time can't truly be measured over sufficiently long distances. But all of those things do have some reasonable equivalent in those domains... just with an asterisk beside them. ", " >>7234196>Yeah, but wouldn't be the universe deterministic without the quantum mechanics?True, I believe the randomness is in part assumed to make calculations easier. In truth that is much of what Thermodynamics is. We don't care to make a deterministic prediction of every molecule of the gas. Such calculations are far too difficult and don't really tell us useful information. We are interested in large scale properties that are averages of the behaviors of all the particles. Properties like pressure and temperature. >can you really assume that your system behave randomly?As I said, a question that has existed in the philosophy of physics for over century.>ten atoms in an 1 \u03bcl container?Would achieve ordered states far more often, of course. But 10 atoms achieving an ordered state for a brief moment wouldn't be useful.>do you believe a perpetual motion machine of the second kind may be theoretically possibel?Personally no. While a deeper philosophical mystery has always existed in thermodynamics, the predictions have always been spot on. I may be wrong and some future technology will change everything, but I honestly think the second law and statistical mechanics as a whole to be the most solid branch of all of physics. It is more 'pure' in its derivation in the sense it relies least on empiricism and comes from statistics when compared to any other physical theory.

Toluene and xylene are well known carcinogens but notably less so then benzene. The exact mechanism that causes cancer is unknown.

This increases risk over time. Interaction with any foreign body may cause abnormal reactions in cell development, or mutation. Some mutations are halted by the immune system as they should be. Your body has a system to fight this. Sometimes though it will not happen that way. Your body will not recognize the threat, or it may be part of your immune system itself like lymphoma and leukemia. Then you have proliferation of cells that can't be stopped by the body's normal mechanisms. How this happens is a subject of a lot of research. ", " You're all wrong. Benzene does not intercalate DNA. The primary mechanism of carcinogenicity is due to benzene metabolites. A simplified picture is as follows. Benzene is first metabolised primarily into benzene oxide by cytochromes in the lungs and liver. This spontaneously rearranges to form phenol, which then undergoes further oxidation to produce catechols, hydroquinone and benzenetriol. Hydroquinone in particular is metabolised by peroxidases in the bone marrow, to first give semiquinone radicals, then benzoquinone.

Because the landscape bees pass in flight moves more slowly when bees fly at higher altitudes, Esch and Burns (1995) conjectured that foragers process the speed with which visual contours move across the eye (optic flow), and integrate this with travel time. To confirm this hypothesis, Srinivasan et al. (2000) further exaggerated the experienced image flow, by training bees to fly through narrow chequered tunnels. These bees grossly overestimated actual travel distance, bragging to their nestmates that they had flown 195 m when in fact they had flown 6 m.

", " >>7196491Okay, so the issue here is that you have no idea about how rocketry or orbital launch works.A thicker atmosphere might help you get off the ground to level flight, but not from level flight to orbit or escape velocity. You need only to get above the atmosphere, but to get to a very high speed, measured in kilometers per second. Just to get to low-Earth orbit is generally regarded as taking about 10 km/s of \"delta-v\" (change of velocity produced by rocket power). Leaving Earth takes about another 4 km/s.Saturn V launching stuff to escape velocity (needed to fly away from a planet), was about 3,000 tons (mostly fuel and liquid oxygen) to throw 60 tons (including the empty third stage). So they needed about 50 times as much mass of propellant as inserted mass.If we're being extremely generous in our assumptions, there might be room on that shuttle for a mass of propellant equal to a third of the total mass. There's a huge difference in the rocket technology required.This water world had higher surface gravity. That is pretty reliably going to mean that it will take more delta-v But the delta-v required to pull out of a gravity well that causes such a large time dilation effect will make the cost of getting to Earth orbit look absolutely negligible.

Simulating large scale interactions by taking into account what happens at a smaller scale, you will have to make breakthroughs in Physics that people have tried for years to do. It's going to be a hefty task to take on. Consider that a closed form solution of the Schrodinger equation has not yet even been found for helium, you'll have to work your way through, or get your computer to solve for the entire periodic table before you can begin to accurately predict what happens at any larger scale. So I don't doubt the validity of your research, indeed you might come up with something that works, but the hurdles you must go through are incredibly high. Inventing a new form of Mathematics to solve the many-body problem, then running a simulation that agrees with both classical and quantum physics, and even when relativistic effects kick in. What language do you intend to write this in? How much computing do you already know? In many undergraduate Physics programs there is an extensive use of computers, and even CS majors have to take the Math courses I've listed above, there is overlap, I would much rather you take the standard Physics courses in undergrad before going into Computational Quantum Chemistry, one anon on this board is working on that.

Now if the Lagrangian has an invariance in one direction (the lines of same height in the picture), then a movement in time along such a line doesn't bother the system and hence this movement is a legal mechanical trajectory. It's movement about which nature doesn't care, price-wise.For example, if your system has translation invariance, then whatever initial momentum value you choose (initial conditions), the system is okay with your physical quantities moving along those translational direction while time passes on. Hence invariance of translation leads to any initial momentum being left alone. ", " >>7172339and I should add that p in the classical newtonian approach is also mostly used a a function .

", " >>7169223Hey, I'm the dude that just posted that thread. I'm a student studying categorical logic and its connections to computational complexity theory, especially in the setting of enriched categories.Categories are very easily defined, which is why they are so prevalent:Call our category C. Then C must have a collection of objects, denoted Ob(C), and a collection of morphisms, each with a domain and a codomain in Ob(C), satisfying the two following axioms: every object has an identity morphism to itself, any two arrows f,g, where the domain of g is the codomain of f, can be composed into a third morphism called gf, with the domain of f and the codomain of g, and if you compose any arrow with an identity morphism, you get the arrow you started with. ", " >>7169247>tfw i will never be a category cos no gf ", " >>7169247Important examples of categories that every mathematician should be familiar with are:- Set, the category of sets, with functions as morphisms. Obviously functions can be composed, and obviously every set has an identity function (these follow from the axioms of whichever axiomatic set theory you choose to work in).- Top, the category of topological spaces, with continuous functions as morphisms. It's very easy to verify that composition of continuous functions gives us a continuous function, and every topological space has an identity function taking every open set to itself.- Vect_k, the category of vector spaces over some fixed field k, with linear maps as morphisms.There are MANY more important examples, but I'm not here to list shit. Categories are useful because we can start to define universal constructions, such as products, coproducts, pullbacks, pushouts, and in general cones and limits, which encompass many important examples. These are useful because we can make statements about universal constructions that apply to seemingly-disparate areas of math, so long as we can construct a suitable category in which to work.Categories can be classified by important properties, such as completion (containing all (small) limits), being a topos, being Cartesian closed, et cetera.

It does this conveniently by not having to fully rely on the `old' mathematical tool of having to call everything a set, and adding structural axioms to each set, and having to come up with tons of set-maps that had to keep track of each piece of data separately and explicitly. The tools are more general so that you can directly translate structural relations and constructions between wildly differently-shaped objects, though ones which have consistent correspondences.

Enjoy those years rather than spending them living in poverty, because they're the best you'll have. See Europe and Australia and some of the skeezier Asian nations, and have a lot of sex with the very willing young ladies in each of them. You're young and wealthy, so enjoy it.Then, when you're 35 or 40, if you invested right and saved well, you can scale back or retire outright. Then's the time to learn all that cool stuff. Heck, become an engineer if you want. At anything you do then, you'll be young enough to be considered a long-term asset, but old enough to beat out a bunch of inexperienced youngsters.Anyway, this is what most of my friends did, and I went the university first route, and now I'm very jealous of them all.

You will learn a lot of things, things that make you (in my opinion) a very valuable addition to any working environment. You will basically learn how to think. But still, you probably won't need analytical mechanics, electrodynamics or quantum field theory in your later job. That's why I can't stress enough that you learn stuff on the side. Learn how to program (most important), learn how to use multiple professional applications, electronics, a language etc. Unis mostly don't teach you all this on the level you need it. Knowing python, c++, matlab, mathematica, root, maybe some CAD, the adobe suite etc doesn't only look good on the CV, but it's also what turns you into a problem solving machine. It's what people expect you to be: They throw a problem at your head and you don't even need to think to have an idea on how to solve it. Most jobs in the industry for physicists are not really clear. You'll learn new stuff all the time, you need to. If you don't like the uncertainty of that, I don't recommend you study physics, but rather something like engineering, which is a safer option.

We can not afford to be investing in less efficient systems, and sadly we likely can't afford what we have now anyway. The energy demands are just too high. By some models I have found in my research we demand an equivalent of as much as 2% of the solar energy that hits the ground, now that includes all human uses not just food, but it is still a very disturbing figure that should scare everyone living today. In the argument by Unibio the energy is just moved to an externality they completely ignore. Their model doesn't account for the energy inside the methane they use, which they only account for as feed material not as an energy source. Let me say that again,  they do not count the chemical energy in methane in their setup! Also their plan is to feed animal to grow more meat, which is one of the least efficient things to do at this point. As for solar panels, they are very competitive at making electricity and should be considered for such direct uses. But we don't eat electricity. So we have to add more and more layers of processing that each have more need for supporting infrastructure that takes other resources. Each step makes it less and less efficient overall. So while open-air agriculture is not very efficient, it is very hard to argue anything else can beat it when fully looked at. I know I started one of my sustainability economics research papers about why we needed to start using these new systems. In the end I was shocked to find out we can't meet our current demand and the newer ways are even worse. At this point I think one of our better options is to subsidize the current demand with nuclear power at steep loss so we can buy time to figure something else out.

The same holds true for both infinite slopes and negatively infinite slopes, these get close to being vertical, but only the slope of 1/0 produces a vertical function.If you want to put 1/0 on a number line, you will have to turn that number line into a circle, and zero will divide positives from negatives on one end, and 1/0 will do the same on the other end.It's really simple, all that you have to do is embrace the facts rather than shy away from them by saying 1/0 is \"undefined\" as mathematicians have done for so long. "}, "replies": [" Have you considered the graph proof I gave? Slopes of graphs formulated as y = mx + b, if infinitesimal, whether positive or negative, are close to being fully horizontal, yet don't quite equal a horizontal slope. The slope of a horizontal line is zero.Likewise, infinite slopes, whether positive or negative, approach verticality, yet don't quite equal a vertical slope.The slope of vertical lines is literally 1/0.Sometimes, undefined values can appear where they are not supposed to exist. You can use calculus to remove discontinuities on graphs for example, such as y = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1), where if x equals 1, it would cause y to be 1/0, causing a discontinuity on the graph. But using limits you can solve the discontinuity:The limit of y as x approaches zero:y = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1)y = (x - 1)(x + 1)/(x - 1)y = (x + 1)y = 0 + 1 = 1Therefore, y should equal one, if you are capable of removing the discontinuity. Thus, this was a \"false\" 1/0.But true 1/0 appears in the graph of the tangent function. Notice: ", " >>7149371At pi/2 and -pi/2 on the x-axis, the y-value of the graph is undefined. But notice where the graph lines are approaching: from the left the function is heading towards positive infinity, while from the right towards negative infinity. At the actual value of pi/2 and -pi/2, the value is 1/0.It seems paradoxical, and so people shy away because they feel a paradox makes no sense. Who cares if it makes no sense? It's a paradox that nevertheless \"is\". That is, it is true. That 1/0 is greater than infinity and lesser than negative infinity boggles conservatives' minds, but it's not hard to just abandon prejudice and embrace that even though these things are paradoxical, they are nevertheless factual.I'd suggest that you say that the amount of numbers between 1 and 1.0001 is really 1/0, not infinity. Infinity implies that you are perpetually increasing in the amount of numbers between 1 and 1.0001. For example, if I subtract an infinitesimally amount from 1.0001, the amount of values between the new number and 1 is still ever-increasing. However, if you say 1/0, you are using a neutral number that establishes absoluteness. ", " >>7149376Here's a curiosity:1 x 0 = 0 and 2 x 0 = 01 = 0/0 and 2 = 0/0If 0/0 = 0/0, then 1 = 21/(1/0) = 1/1 x 0/1 = 0If 0 x 0 = 0, then 0/0 = 0.But if 0/0 = 1 = 2 = 0, then do all real numbers equal each other?I honestly believe that they ultimately do, except that values can be perceived as having different appearances based on realization. This gets you deep into metaphysics.But I ask, if 0D points lack length, how come there's an endless number of points found within a 1 cm line segment, and the same endless number of points found within a 2 cm line segment, when an endless number of points stacked to each other, all lacking length, should produce still a 0D point? So does 0 = 1 = 2 when divided by 1/0?0/(1/0) = 0/1 x 0/1 = 0/01/(1/0) = 1/1 x 0/1 = 0/12/(1/0) = 2/1 x 0/1 = 0/20/0 = 0/1 = 0/2 = 0, right?Meanwhile, if you multiply 0 times 1/0 you can get 0, but also 1, and also 2, as I proved above:0 x 1/0 = 0/0 = 0 = 1 = 2This is very metaphysical stuff. But you must accept it is true, because it can be proven even if it seems nonsensical.

", " I've considered this before, OP. I can't find my notebook where I worked it all out, but I'll give you the gist.Those who have played snooker at any sort of level beyond \"we were at the bar one time,\" will have noticed that after the break, there is some definite strategy, and that you do tend to break the game down into positions. Your shot to drop a red should set you up for another ball (preferably black), which in turn should set you up for another red, etc.You can do this because the pockets are larger than the balls, so there is a range of angles that will sink a ball, and an area of physical locations that will allow you both sink a ball and place the cue ball into... some region. So you can define regions that look like R = (B1, P1) --> Rc where B1, P1 means that you can sink ball B1 in pocket P1, and also place the cue ball in the region Rc. It's sort of a continuation semantics thing, like in comp sci formal languages. You can include a null move, where no ball goes into a pocket and you go to some other region, and you can include side effects R = (B1, P1) --> ((B2, P2) --> R2) U (B3 --> R3) --> Rc ...I think I ended up modelling the pockets as inescapable regions, where a sort of pruning to the state tree occurs. Anyway, it doesn't matter.So you do this, and you end up with an algebraic structure, a monoid, that describes all possible games. The number of elements is a graph-theoretic/combinatorial thing. For pockets which are exactly the same size as a ball, it's quite large, worse than O(n!) for n balls. But if you have larger pockets, it becomes much smaller, and if you limit yourself to, say, looking ahead k shots and moving no more than j balls on any shot, then you get a polynomial p(n, j, k) number of positions. But it's very hard to solve (the coefficients are Stirling numbers or something like that), so I only ever approximated it. And I don't remember the approximate value anyway. ", " >>7144773But anyway, I hope this helps you think about it some. Just because a system is continuous, that doesn't mean that it can't be treated discretely! The fact that you have the choice of angle (assuming perfect play) and the fact that your shots are limited in terms of power combine to give the sort of graph that would allow game theoretic analysis.The game itself is always going to have a solution of some sort, given a few assumptions. Basically, there's enough freedom in how you place your shots that you'll always be able to do something, or if you do nothing, then your opponent will be able to do something, or.... Given good enough play, you can't go on snookering each other indefinitely. ", " >>7144788Oh, and I wanted to mention one more thing. Allowing curved shots, draws, and so on drastically reduces the number of positions. I suspect that this is at the root why better players are really better, and why they play faster. (Well, that and the basic look-ahead.) The good player's regions are bigger, so the number of states required is reduced. A mediocre player looks at a position and is overwhelmed by possibilities. They can't look ahead as far. A good player sees, \"Oh yes, I can pot this ball here, and place the cue here, and that'll be good enough to do this and this and this.\" They can look ahead 10 moves if they so please because there aren't many options. It's like a forcing line in chess. But the mediocre player is beset by complications. ", " >>7144773One of the \"infinite positions\" fags here again, I think I'm getting at what you mean now.It isn't so much about the physical location of the balls relative to the table, but rather the angle of the balls relative to each other.If a ball is positioned such that it forms an angle within a certain threshold, it doesn't actually matter how many fractions of a degree it's off. As long as a player is skilled enough, there's a tolerance for different ball placement.For example, you can theoretically get the same results from both ball A and ball B in this picture, even though they are nowhere near each other.This is not immediately obvious though, and OP is still a dick.

", " >>7146729See >>7144773 >>7144788 >>7144813 >>7144907The balls can only have so many angle thresholds relative to each other. Exact distances don't make a given shot any different, so it actually works as a set of ranges.These ranges aren't too unlike the grid of a chessboard in the sense that they limit the overall types of moves you can make. Picture a scenario where the cue ball is behind the 8 ball, which is just in front of the top left corner pocket.It doesn't matter if the cue ball is 5cm closer or farther from the 8 ball, or even if it's to the left or right a bit. As long as it's roughly behind the 8 ball, it can push it into the corner pocket in one shot. This is one possible position for these two balls, just like a knight to to the left of a pawn is on a chess board.Now you just need to account for every single ball on the field relative to each other.You'd need a more rigorous way to set up this sort of collection of angle thresholds as an actual grid system before you could calculate just how many there are, but it's not impossible.

In theory, at this height, one could walk outside on a deck with no protection but an air mask (except for a raincoat for the occasional sulfur rains)This means that all you would need is a balloon to float safely above Venus (indeed much more safely than Earth).Since the atmospheric gases are so similar (CO, CO2, N,H2SO4) then any tear in your flotation device would mean a very, very slow outgas, not a dangerous one like if you had a helium balloon on Earth. In theory you could fill your balloon with Earth atmosphere (not H or He even) and you would float. You would require very little temperature control, and you would be above the clouds, and so near to the sun, so solar panels should work great. You can harvest atmosphere and process a small about of O2, N and other breathable gases, as well as water.

Habitats, solar platforms, atmospheric processors, science labs, landing platforms for airships/probes/unmanned drones, storage, medical quarters, communications modules, recreation, manufacturing, etc. All of these can be delivered to Venus and easily connected to the existing infrastructure web, similar to the ISS protocol. Each one would have its own buoyancy, and can receive or transmit power and other resources. Habitats in particular could have two decks: A windowed upper deck and a shielded lower deck with some small portholes. The upper deck can be used for whatever you want, while the lower deck houses the essentials like supplies, batteries, life support, living quarters, etc. Each module has a ballast beam that keeps the bottom of the module pointed down. The ballast beam could hold an atmospheric pump or whatever you wanted. Each module could contain 4 docking tubes in case you want to connect that particular module in any direction. The rest of the unneeded docking tubes remain sealed.Each module's buoyancy is controlled by compartmentalized balloons that can be easily serviced from the deck of the module (not having to climb a hundred meters of cable, 90km above the surface to service the balloon).

Empty fuel tanks that enter Venuses atmosphere would float...So realistically, as long as there is Earth atmosphere in the base, the base has a high chance of remaining high above the wind corridors.I suppose a high-flowing turbulence could occur.

Much like the \"Mars One\" project's not planning for a return vehicle, I fear Venus would be the same.

But once you got it going, you could ferry up to orbit pretty much as many times as you like with minimal effort.I'm picturing a cluster system, using parallel staging of identical modules. You'd toss them at Venus empty, so it wouldn't cost too much. You could also manufacture them on Venus from native materials, if you just sent the fuel and some fittings. Carbon fiber composite tanks, graphite moderator, carbon-carbon nozzles and vanes -- most of the mass could be made from carbon generated from atmospheric CO2.Venus is a good place for nuclear reactor power sources, since the thick atmosphere makes sinking heat easy, and hot air balloons can't run out of lifting gas.

Perhaps the stages fall back into venus, and are collected by either autonomous airship drones or manned crafts that collect the stages and bring them back to the base. Anything in Earth orbit can be docked with an Earth station, then filled up and reused on the way back to Venus, which is dropped into the atmosphere and collected by aforementioned airships.

If you want to return a human to Earth, you don't have to drop the interplanetary transit vehicle out of orbit. So you really only need to take about 200 kg of flesh and minimal life support and maneuvering equipment up from Venus into orbit and back into the transit vehicle.I wonder also about a nitrous-oxide/carbon hybrid rocket.

There is no true \"landing\", you just aerobrake and then float, which doesn't require any precision timing. Airships, winged aircraft, and helicopters all work very well. CO2 and N2 are available in abundance (on Mars, while there is an atmosphere, it's a struggle to compress it from the near-vacuum atmosphere). H2SO4 can be harvested from clouds to provide hydrogen to make water and plastics.

We've done plenty of studying of the effects of micro-gravity on board the ISS, but our understanding of partial gravity is still severely lacking. Venus colonisation removes that risk.also, on escaping the gravity well of Venus: any attempt to seriously colonise the planet would have to start with a megastructure for getting onto and out of the atmosphere.

It makes your vehicle go 1 m/s faster or slower, and let's say your vehicle's empty mass is 1 kg. It makes the arithmetic simpler.So here is the basic kinetic energy equation:e=(mv^2)/2If your initial speed is 0 m/s, and you accelerate to 1 km/s, your empty-mass kinetic energy (the kinetic energy of the empty vehicle, disregarding the kinetic energy of the propellant) increases from 0 joules to 1*1*1/2= 1/2 of a joule, for a gain of 0.5 joules.But if your initial speed is 1 m/s, and your initial empty-mass kinetic energy is 1/2 of a joule, and you increase the speed by 1 m/s to 2 m/s, your empty-mass energy increases to 1*2*2/2 = 2 joules, for a gain of 1.5 joules.That's three times as much energy gain out of the same amount of propellant: the Oberth effect.The energy isn't coming from nowhere, by magic. You're taking advantage of the kinetic energy of the propellant, in addition to its chemical energy.If your vehicle isn't going fast when you start the burn, that kinetic energy isn't there to take advantage of, so you get less gain of empty-mass kinetic energy.

", " >>7136688...and you can't take advantage of gravitational potential energy in the same way, because the propellant still has all of its gravitational potential when it separates from the vehicle (because it's still at the same altitude), whereas (if you're accelerating with the direction of movement) it will lose some of its kinetic energy because it's being accelerated against the direction of movement by the rocket nozzle, and ends up at a lower speed.If you want to use gravitational potential energy for the Oberth effect, you first have to convert it to kinetic energy. The possibility of doing so is one of the things that makes orbital maneuvering so complicated. Sometimes, you can get more out of your propellant by first doing a little burn at apogee (or from a circular orbit) to lower your perigee, then doing a big burn at your perigee. With multiple gravity wells, it can get very complicated.

Degrees are a construct for human convenience, the same as Fahrenheit and ounces.The only real, fundamental constants we can rely on between star systems would be planck units, but those are just too ridiculous to use except when talking about particles.

I ended up knocking out the chem degree in my junior and senior years. IMO, a chem degree is more versatile, and offers a more comprehensive background, spanning in various other scientific disciplines. Also, I would argue that, to understand any biological system or pathway, you need to understand the underlying chemistry (that's why you'll have to take gen chem and organic chem and biochem).

In fact, you can major in a completely different field, as long as you knock out your pre-reqs. But, if you're not sure what you want to do or where you'll end up, you should consider two things.

Neanderthal had 46 chromosomes as well, which was why we were able to interbreed with them (and several other Homo species.)What I think is confusing you is due to the fact that the human phenotypic traits have great variability and that because they look different, they must be of different origins. Genetics tell you otherwise, as men especially share the same mitochondrial DNA that stemmed from the first successful humans. Color variations, structural variates all appear in the human race. All of these are phenotypic, meaning they naturally occur in the population. Africans are merely a melanistic version of humans.

", " >>7117080When I was still in school (1990s) studying biology, the term \"subspecies\" was considered a biological term, whereas \"race\" was generally considered a sociological term. A subspecies is a morphologically distinct group that can interbreed with members of the same species. Subspecies are typically geographically inaccessible to one another or don't interbreed for other factors. In plants, the term \"variety\" is used instead instead of subspecies.The term \"race\" however is typically only applied to humans, and it can be used to refer to very minor morphological difference as well as ancestral origin or even arbitrary classifications based on social rules. Most people groups that would be classified as \"races\" would not meet the definition of subspecies because the morphological traits that distinguish one from another are very minor and occur on a continuum that is spread through the species. It may be that various species of hominids known to anthropologists would be better characterized as subspecies, and there are some isolated and undiscovered tribes that may also qualify, but by and large, most biologists would probably classify modern humans as a common species without subspecies.In other words, this issue is it that you want to redefine basic terms of biology in order to fit your racist viewpoint, not that the dominating biological viewpoint - established in an age when racism was the norm - is somehow masking the existence of race for sake of political correctness.

Let P = p1p2...pr+1 and let p be a prime dividing P; then p can not be any of p1, p2, ..., pr, otherwise p would divide the difference P-p1p2...pr=1, which is impossible. So this prime p is still another prime, and p1, p2, ..., pr would not be all of the primes.Alright, so I finally got around to taking a look at this. I think I understand. If p divides P and is a prime number, then it should be on that list of prime numbers (p1p2...pr). But because it is a known property that a number that divides two other numbers also divides the difference of the latter two numbers (in this case p would have to divide P-p1p2...pr ), p would have to divide 1 because P is the list with a one added on, so the difference would be one. Since it is known that you cannot divide 1 by a prime number, p would not have been able to be on the list. If it was, then it would have had to divide both the product of the list we made as well as the product of the list we made plus one. So either P is a prime number that wasn't on our original list or P is divided by a prime number that CAN'T be on the original list.The only thing that kind of confused me was the bit about how a number that divides two numbers also divides the difference of the two numbers, because I didn't remember it.

The other case is to mix between resistors in series and in parallel. For example, one resistor might be in parallel with 2 resistors in series. That would also be 6 cases. If you mirror the circuit that adds another 6 cases. You could also have a resistor in series with parallel resistors and vise versa. Each adding 6 cases.

If you're interested in a more updated and reliable model (that also accounts for human variability and explains the differences between people with the same MBTI personality time) you should look up Leary's 8 Circuit Model of Personality.Leary's model consists of 8 circuits of development:Circuits of Lower consciousness:1. Bio-Survival Circuit2. Emotional/Territorial Circuit3. Rational/Symbolic Circuit4. Socio/Sexual CircuitCircuits of Higher consciousness:5. The Neurosomatic circuit6. Metaprogramming7. Neurogenetic8. Quantum non-local circuitHow does this model compare to other models? Like MBTI?In a comparison with Jung's model you would see that Jung takes into account the first 3 circuits, ignores the 4th and groups the remaining 4 higher circuits into what he calls Intuition.>It is amusing to note that Freud recognized the first circuit as>the oral stage, the second as the anal stage and the fourth as the>genital stage. He did not notice the third, semantic circuit\u2014>perhaps because as an obsessive Rationalist he was so absorbed>in verbal and conceptual programs that they were invisible to>him, as water may be to fishes.

The Axiomatic system only contains five axioms but one of them is that your Euclidean space has a metric and is thus a metric space (this is a pretty powerful axiom). This allows you to define transformations on the Euclidean space as isomorphisms with regard to your metric and this in turn makes a lot of proofs almost trivial. It also lets you prove things like Pasch's axiom as a theorem (which you cannot do with Euclid's axioms) and gives you a firm foundation upon which to talk about stuff like wallpaper groups.

You can always shrink the sum to a vector on the sphere by multiplying it by a suitable scalar.

They haven't given you a full answer because they are either being lazy, or closed-minded (or both).A vector space is just an algebra over a field that is also enriched in an abelian group. Your question can also be stated as such: \"what sort of structure can we add to spherical coordinates to make it a vector space?\"I think the most appealing and obvious answer is to consider the Riemann sphere, which is a mapping from the complex plane to the unit sphere (or in this case, the unique sphere of radius r in R^3, with a great circle going through (0,0,2r), and (0,0,0), and with a bijection from the variety <z=0> to C). Then, we define a linear map from C to our set of vectors to coincide with the map that takes C to the sphere, and the vector operations in our spherical vector space coincide with vector analysis in C.The only problem with this construction, OP, is that it doesn't include the vertical vector going to (0,0,2r) \\in R^3. However, other models could accomplish this if we wanted. ", " >>7073757Funny, as soon as you mentioned ellipsoids and orthogonal vectors, I knew you were talking about DTI.

A full course in lie groups is pretty involved as it pulls information from a lot of different areas. On the other hand, there are a lot of nice examples of lie groups which you already know a lot about - namely matrix groups. Think about n x n matrices and mapping each matrix to a vector in R^(n^2). This is where the manifold part of matrix groups comes, for example. It's nice to be able to attach algebraic structure and a differentiable structure to an object.

A matrix is sort of an abstract term and difficult to visualize as anything other than a grid. Rank 2 tensors can be fairly intuitively visualized as an ellipsoid. Probably due to historical reasons as well.Either way, DTI is probably going out of use in the next few years, because especially for fiber tracking its essentially useless as it can't resolve crossing fibers. In the future you'll hear MRI people talking about Q-balls and constrained spherical deconvolutions more often. Anyways, MRI people usually don't specifically point out it's a rank 2 tensor.

SO it is what's INSIDE the genes, what decides the outcome of YOU, not the % of the difference.You write 3 programs. You then remove some parts of said programs, first one you leaves as it is, for the second one you take out the comments and some useless shit that doesn't effect the program in the slightest, and for the 3rd one you leave out the most important function so the program won't be able to do what the first and the second do.

The solution would be a function describing the velocity of the spaceship at a given time.This would be like knowing exactly how to fire the rockets to get to the moon.Differential equations get really hard really fast, and sometimes we have to approximate solutions. One question that's especially interesting in this study is \"how good is an approximation?\" This question has answers for a wide variety of approximate solution methods.In general, since differential equations are so hard, physicists, engineers and even some types of mathematicians almost always approximate their answers, so they know about how long to fire the rockets so that it's right, but they're not guessing.

", " >>7064249>would you say that radiationI'd specify on what kind of radiation I was talking about.Fall out is made of unstable isotopes of elements that decay over time releasing other decay products, neutrons and photons. Fall out can move like a cloud because it's usually hot when it comes out of an explosion so it rises then settles as it cools or gets blown around by wind. Radiation travels in straight lines because they are particles emitted from a nucleus. Gamma radiation is light so it behaves exactly like light doing all of the light-like things you'd expect light to do. The same is true for neutron and beta radiation because they are particles but behave slightly differently because they aren't bosons; they have mass and velocity. The same is probably true of an alpha particle but alpha particles are helium nuclei so when it pulls two electrons off of something it becomes regular old helium. I'd expect it'd have to lose a significant portion of it's energy in order to behave like a gas but evidently alpha particles get stopped by paper so...whatever.>a variety of heatErrr, nuclear reactions also create electromagnetic radiation that can be absorbed by atoms increasing there kinetic energy which we measure as heat. This is the source of the fire ball everyone talks about. Photons emitted by a nuclear reaction start at a very high energy or short wavelength and as they are absorbed and re-emitted lose a portion to increase the kinetic energy of the atom they were absorbed by. X-rays can propagate through materials because they don't lose a whole lot of energy when they are absorbed and re-emitted. ", " >>7064283Depends on the medium at which they are traveling through. Photons always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum so in space it would take the speed of light amount of time to get to you. In other medium it's a little slower; n = c/v where n is the refractive index, c is c and v is the speed.>particle radiationDafuq is that? Photons are particles too.Neutrons, alpha and beta particles are all fermions so they have mass and velocity (for the most part...uncertainty and all that). They all behave differently because they interact with their environments differently. ", " >>7064249Nope, that's totally wrong.First of all, there's two kinds of \"radiation\" a nuclear explosion releases.There's direct emission of ionizing radiation - alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons. These behave like light, basically - they emanate from the source in straight lines, and are absorbed by solid materials. Generally, the more mass - lead, concrete, water, dirt, air, whatever - between you and the source, the more is absorbed. Different types of radiation are more or less harmful and are absorbed by different amounts of stuff. (Alpha rays, for instance, can generally be stopped by a sheet of paper or the layer of dead skin cells and oil on your body.) Things hit by substantial amounts of neutron radiation become radioactive.Then there's radioactive STUFF - fallout. This isn't \"radiation\" - but it is stuff that emits radioactivity. When a nuke goes off, it throws a lot of radioactive dust into the air. This travels like a cloud, carried by the air. Inhalation or ingestion of fallout causes it to get into your body, where the radiation it emits is extremely damaging. ", " A 500 kt MIRV deployed warhead air bursts 10 miles from you.A - standing clearview of the bombpermanent blindness, burnsB - standing behind a wall, moving away from both that wall and the explosionC - standing inside of a roomD - standing between two wallsE - standing inside of a room with many rooms in-front/adjacent possible injury from broken glass and falling furniture, fires will likely start and spread towards your home forcing your to leave and encounter dangerous levels of fallout, if the wind blows the fallout away from you, there are no fires and you huddle in the center of your home for 24 hours then immediately vacate in the direction away from the bomb you might escape unscathed though you will be at a higher risk of cancer, if there are several bombs detonated in the general area then fallout will be much worse and you will have to stay in your home for longer and possibly drink contaminated food and water ", " >>7064236>Fall out produces neutron radiation which is what makes most people sick.Not correct. Fallout is the residual nuclear material raining on the ground. So it's Alpha, Beta, Gamma radiation. The neutrons are produced during criticality, so during the actual explosion.

They come from the nuclei of atoms. Neutrons can still be released from decay products if the nucleus of a decay product is too large for the strong force to keep it together. Isotopes are sometimes radioactive. You get high energy photons every time an isotope decays because smaller nuclei require smaller binding energies and that energy needs to go somewhere.You could make an argument about fast moving neutrons and slow moving neutrons but that depends on what kind of decay you're talking about.

This is usually not meant by the word \"fallout\".>You get high energy photons every time an isotope decays because smaller nuclei require smaller binding energies and that energy needs to go somewhere.That is just gamma decay. In alpha and beta decay the energy goes into the kinetic energy of the decay products (electrons, alpha particles, neutrinos).>You could make an argument about fast moving neutrons and slow moving neutrons but that depends on what kind of decay you're talking about.That has nothing to do with it. Point is there is not neutron radiation involved when discussing fallout. Neutron radiation is only significant during criticality. ", " >>7064432I respectfully retract my post and accept correction.That reading thing... ", " Well, first you gotta discriminate between directly and indirectly ionizing radiation.At 10 miles distance, you're probably safe from the directly ionizing radiation (alpha, electrons).What remains is the indirectly ionizing stuff (gammas/xrays, neutrons). Now, gammas of course move at c (adjusted for optical density of atmosphere, yadda yadda), so your movement won't make a world of difference here. Most modern-day nuclear devices are probably FFF (fission-fusion-fission), so the neutron burst from the fusion fuel will ignite the tertiary bomb stage.Immediately, that leaves us with high-energy photons. Those will spread equally in all directions, which means intensity at your distance d decreases as a function of 1/(d^2). Bottom line: No matter what you do, increasing distance is pretty much always the most sensible thing to do (plus, the easiest. Who has pockets full of lead sheathing and concrete blocks).Now, for your situations. (cont. next post) ", " (...cont.)A: Yeah, man, that sucks. Absolutely no protection. The air, of course, shields a little bit, but with the low density all you have going for your wellbeing is really pair creation, which relies heavily on Z for its cross section.B: Better, higher density and Z than air. There's a weird effect, though: If the wooden wall is rather thin (maybe about 1 cm) and you're really close to it, you're actually going to feel MORE effects than without the damn thing. Reason: Mean free path for photons is huge, even in your body. there's a good chance a whole lot of those suckers will punch right through your arms, fingers etc. without ever interacting. By standing next to the wall, you not only get the photons, but also the secondary charged particles from created from the photon-wood-interaction. So yay for surface damage due to \u00df-particles.C: You get more shielding from above. Good thing.D: If we assume this setup | you | nuclear explosion... ditch that wall. It'll create scatter back to you and does nothing for your protection.E: Disregarding the massive face full o' glass you'll get due to the shockwave, the average density and Z of glass should actually be higher than wood.

Otherwise, we must construct an independent grammar so as to preserve that precious consistency that we care so much about.

I got you ", " >>7034244Rather well said.I think that your philosophical crux can be in some sense epitomized by the Yoneda's Lemma and the Yoneda Embedding.I know you well-know this, but I will briefly gesticulate around it for others.Yoneda's Lemma says that each object A is defined up to natural isomorphism by its Hom-set Hom(\u00b7,A) (or dually Hom(A,\u00b7).This allows us to define objects by specifying their hom-sets. For instance, the tensor product of A and B can, by Yoneda's Lemma, be defined as the object whose morphisms to any other object C are pairs of bilinear maps from AxB to C. Every other category-theoretic construct can similarly be defined by, instead of specifying universal properties, specifying Hom-sets.The Yoneda Embedding is beautiful, elegant, and extraordinary. To me, it is the real justification for the category-theoretic perspective, as by it objects really can be regarded as *nothing but* the data of their hom-sets.Thus does it epitomize and precisely instantiate your stance, and realize Category Theory as a realization of Hilbert's belief (and Grothendieck's heuristic) that, as you said, \"math is not about studying the objects, but the relationships between them.\"---Even as a set-theorist, I must admit to an appreciation of the way in which, as that author said, \"Category theory is the mathematics of mathematics.\" Metamathematics, by its very name, earns that distinction, but category theory does indeed likewise hold it in a disjoint and extraordinarily elegant mode.

If you google the term, you can find plenty of instances of well-known authors pluralizing it as \"topoi\".Even if \"toposes\" holds the majority in your locus of reference, I strongly encourage you to insist on and use \"topoi\"; it is both more elegant and -- (this is the \"objective\" mathematical-utility argument) -- syntactically compact.

The question ironic, btw., since in this case the naming of thing mattered much to the authorhttp://xahlee.info/math/i/Alexander_Grothendieck_cartier.pdf>What topic within mathematics is the most beautiful?I couldn't answer this, because over the years I learned to admire topics which I despised before. I'm pretty sure I have the capability to like every mathematical subject - it's particularly easy when you need it for something else. You dig into it, and see what it is and what it isn't, and how it fits into other areas. I don't \"like\" model theory, but learning about it helped me to understand mathematics as a whole. I feel the same with topoi, but with I'm also sometimes afraid that there are just better abstraction out there. I think everyone secretly or explicitly works on their own foundations - searches for order in the totality of math.What I like the least is probably raw classification theorems of structures that I don't know any use for in physics. Some nieces of topology where people still research and publish papers because the problems and well defined and approachable. It's hard to pin it down because of the unreasonable effectiveness - before path integrals over spacetime metrics , I don't think people like me cared too much about classification of 4-manifolds either.I'm currently searching for good problems to solve, so I search around and have no favorite subject.

But, before that I was looking at elliptic curves and some bizarre varieties, and before that I was researching categorical definitions of Turing machines.

This also pushes another interesting point that you brought up: the most interesting theorems are always the ones that show us deep connections between seemingly-distant areas of math, such as Conway's monstrous moonshine.

I may have misinterpreted your motives, however.>Categorical turing machinesI actually found almost no literature on the subject, which is what lead me to want to formalize it myself. I ended up defining a category of tapes (functions from Z to an alphabet) from a fixed alphabet (which I treated as a pointed set, with the point being the blank symbol), with morphisms being shifts left, shifts right, printing over the value at the zero of the tape (with a special case being the identity morphism); a category of states, where halting states are terminal objects, with state transitions being the morphisms (and identity obviously being the trivial transition), and a functor taking every pair (T,S) of a tape T and a state S from the product of those two categories to an object in Hom(S,-). This means that analyzing the machine is equivalent to analyzing properties of a small monad. My goal was to define a canonical product of Turing machines, and approach computational complexity problems from that stance.I haven't really read any physics-directed math publications, but I have read a survey and a paper on q-theory, especially stuff like the q-Pochhammer symbol. What got me into that, however, was a paper I read on the umbral calculus. I found both subject extremely fascinating. I am going to check out the arXiv paper that you linked to.

", " (cont.)The particle is confined to the xy-plane, while the magnetic field is pointing in z-direction:B = B_z e_z, A=B_z x e_yThen the Lagrangian isL = (m/2) \\delta_{ij} x^i' x^j' - (e/c) A_ix^i'(MathJax would break, I know it)with canonical momentum\\pi_i = \\frac{d L}{d x^i'} = m \\delta_{ij} x^j' + (e/c) B_{ij} x^j \\approx (e/c) B_{ij}x^jwhere with a constant matrix B_{ij} such that A_i=B_{ij} x^j, and we considered the limit of small masses m. With the canonical Poisson brackets\\{\\p_i,x^j\\}=\\delta_i^j we find\\{x^i,x^j\\}=(c/e)(B^{-1})^{ij}and after canonical quantization we end up with a noncommutative space!The semi-classical limit of that, in turn, are diff. manifolds equipped with a \\theta-tensor, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_manifoldwhich is a direct generalization of symplectic manifold. Kontsevich won the fields medal for, I think, showing that on any such manifold you can introduce a quantum theory.You map the function space with algebra f\u00b7g to a non-commutative operator algebra f*g = f\u00b7g + O(hbar)(the simplest example is the Moyal product)Noncommutative spacetimes themselves then also emerged in a limit of a certain string theory. Some physicists then took the resulting field theory and considered it as a quantum theory itself. http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0506186v1.pdfAnd in those theories you can identify a metric in terms of the Poisson tensor => spacetime geometry emerges. Roughly, g=\\theta^2. And what we experience as gravity is \u201eflat spacetime minus (i\u00b7hbar)^2\".The matrix model dynamics of theta of course imply dynamics for g and to be of physical relevance, their first order approximation should be general relativity, i.e. the Einstein field equations.For my Masters I was finding thetas in the semi-classical (diff. geometrical) approximation of a certain matrix model. ", " (cont.)Pic related was the theta found which gave the most physical metric of my classwikipedia.org/wiki/Reissner%E2%80%93Nordstr%C3%B6m_metric>>7051160Yes, for example: no law of excluded middle => reflection principles.Also, if you learn type theory you start to like some concepts more (categorical limits, for me), and you start to find some axioms uninteresting. LEM is a good example. And choice, for me, is a temporary tool with which people cook up conjectures and give names to thought up objects. I think I\u2019ve done too little functional analysis to understand why mathematicians would like it.>>??Some guy with an iso-up-to-iso idea made a thread 2 days ago, but it\u2019s gone it seems.If you read this thread: I recalled that there is a concept of isomorphism typehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_species#Types_and_unlabelled_structures(and incidentally it can be defined in terms of le presheaves.)

It is easy to pass maths by memorising theorems and their proofs, and practising your plug-and-chug skills. The distributions of marks for mathematics students tend to have two peaks; those who remembered the proofs, and those who didn't.Undergrad physics is more intuitive (especially once you get used to special relativity and quantum mechanics) and this makes it easier to pick up. You will find that exams include more unseen material than maths exams, and require enough familiarity with the subject to apply what you already know to a new situation.I've not studied either beyond this point formally, but the graduate texts I've read indicate that physics becomes much more like mathematics, in the sense of my previous paragraph. Modern papers on quantum field theory (for example) almost read like pure mathematics. Graduate maths can be very full-on, but contains some of the post beautiful of all human creation.I don't know about chemistry, but like maths, you can get by with memorisation, but there is so much going on that it can be essential to understand the theory behind it all.Enjoy this knight fighting a snail, you pervert.

Sexual selection is an interesting strategy if you think about. If you are more likely to eaten because of your characteristics, yet somehow manage to survive and reproduce, chances are you have good fitness worthy of passing on and do. If mating is somehow influenced by said characteristics, it is more important to mate and reproduce than survive. Also evolution is not a process which designs the best organism for survival. It is merely an action of advantages mutations that increase fitness, thus increases the likelihood of reproducing and passing on that advantage. If it works well, the organism will be better able to resist environmental selection pressure than its non-mutated counterpart and should slowly create a parapatric speciation event if not isolated.

It is not fundamental: people are made of particles, and the laws governing these particles are sufficient to explain *everything* about how people behave. But these laws are too complicated to solve exactly, so we use models to approximate them. One of these models is that of rational agents with free will.But just as Newtonian gravity is very accurate, yet ultimately wrong, so too is free will a very accurate, but wrong model. We use it insofar as it gives us useful predictions, but the true underlying laws do not contain a term for free will. It only arises implicitly as an approximate limit for certain patterns of particles: kinds the patterns that form us. ", " So no one is going to bring social conditioning into this discussion, or the fact that personality is derived from how neurons fire within a design constructed of \"atoms and particles\"? Free will is A LOT more complicated than all of these douchers are claiming. ", " >>7024795depends on how you define free will, in a meaningful context I define free will as the inability to predict a system's reaction perfectly, knowing the exact state of the system and what stimulus will be added. I suppose if you knew the exact position and momentum of every particle in their body you would be able to predict their reaction perfectly, but considering that's impossible, we have free will in every sense except for the technical one where someone constantly knows how everything in our body is interacting, and how it will react to anything they say. ", " >>7024795Not even science is needed to put the premise that there is no free will. Just by analyzing reality, you can get an idea.Imagine a \"bad\" person who at some point of his life is given the option of saving a little girl from a fire on her house, or going to the store to buy some ice cream. Due to his personality, he is obviously going to pick the latter. If he, for some reason, is convinced otherwise to help the girl, and he accepts because he feels regret, that's because it was also in his personality. Now, if you put a \"good\" person, he will obviously at least consider helping the girl, because his personality made him care more about her situation.Now: do we choose our personality? No. Nobody chooses where to be born. I could've been born as Hitler, or being the op. And the reader could have been me, writing this crap.And that is why I think there is no free will. We have our personality, and we stay with it forever. IF, for some reason, we can change our genes or our personality with the power of our mind of whatever, that's because it was also in our personality to be able to have the willpower to change itself. In the end, it changes nothing. ", " When pondering free will you should also consider the system we live in and how it is made of atoms, particles and their governing properties.

", " >>7027244That is obvious, but going that deep of course you can say things like math and gravity and space and atom and shit have to follow those rules.But let's look at it from our standpoint, a regular persons one.For us, and for anyone, is there free will?I do think that I've never meet a person that felt free to me, and we can say that people don't have the free will to decide where they are from, who raised them, how they were raised etc.But there can still be free will, if we don't let the past effect us, and things we do.If we don't let rules, and what we should and shouldn't do by society or whatever make our choices for us.Right?

Social conditioning has A LOT to do with it. Free will in doing as one has learned by social conditioning is extremely powerful way to steer people's behaviour.We are all to some extent slaves under our emotions. What we have learned or been taught using those emotions, however, is not carved in stone. And as you grow older you learn that other people will try and use whatever conditioning you have to affect your behaviour. It becomes extremely much more complex. Peoples behaviour can start seeming erratic or \"disturbed\".

His analysis showed that it worked best at a small size, and the absolute maximum scale that it could possibly work at would be for a payload of \"two men and a ham sandwich\".So of course, starting with quite modest funding and no realistic prospects for more, he decided they should build it as a manned vehicle with a crew of two.They built a tall non-rocket, non-space helicopter, then ran out of money and gave up. ", " >>7004748it's angled, so it's much less efficient.Although there was the Roton... ", " >>7004789It can actually be more efficient. A tip-rocket helicoptor rotor is more efficient at low speeds than just a rocket, because it uses a small amount of rocket propellant to push a large amount of air downward.That's what was supposed to make Roton work better than a normal rocket. It would gain altitude efficiently with the helicopter rotor, and then go to orbit by ordinary rocket power.Even in the best case, this would provide no payload benefit or fuel savings, but in theory it would allow you to take the helicopter rotor to orbit without a payload penalty, which means you got your device for controlled descent and soft landing \"for free\" in your mass budget.This should be a big deal in an SSTO, which always have payload mass fraction problems even when they're still on the drawing board (where they always seem to stay). When you start trying to add hardware for reusability, it gets ugly fast.However, you have to consider the fact that it's a helicopter space ship. If you start to feel yourself thinking that something like a helicopter space ship or a nuclear bomb pogo stick is a good idea, it's time to take a step back and re-examine your assumptions, maybe after a good night's sleep, with a particular eye to how you're actually going to make it work and solve the inevitable engineering problems that will spring up in testing.

It's a major improvement over their previous recovery attempts, which never had a solid surface to land on.More importantly, they demonstrated a precisely targetted impact point. If they can do that every time, even without reusability, it would change the launch business entirely. No more \"range\". No more \"flight termination system\". No more clearing a wide area of traffic to protect people from falling rocket parts. No more needing to locate launch facilities on a coast or the edge of a wasteland.

SpaceX is piling up inventory of recovered Dragons, which will be available for future resupply contracts.If they get first stage reuse working, as seems likely, and NASA accepts Dragon reuse, the next contract could be 12 launches for $500 million, performed exactly on schedule.However the Dragon V1 is not as valuable for reuse as the Dragon V2 will be. Not only is the V2 being designed for carrying human passengers, but the propulsive landing capability will make recovery much cheaper and faster, since it will be able to land on a landing pad. Even in the early operating mode, which will involve landings by parachute in a desert, will make it cheaper and more convenient to recover than with the V1's splashdown, since they'll just be able to drive a truck out and pick it up, rather than needing to take a ship out to the deep ocean.

First and foremost, I will state that I am in the STEM field and my life has always been ruled by rationality and logic. Religion is one such area where we can neither prove nor disprove the claims that God exist, or anything after death holds any watertight weight. It comes down to a personal decision on what you believe. You can't prove/disprove what comes next. With that being said, I believe that God exist. I believe in a creator that created the laws of physics that the observed world obeys. I believe that God created all of the laws that science shows to hold. I believe (without proof) that this God died on a cross for the sins of all men. I believe that the only path to a good afterlife is to be saved by this God; by asking him to forgive you of your sins and acceptance of him into your heart. If you believe in God, you will not perish.As evident by John 3:16 \" For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"If you truly want to know God, while you still have time on this earth, then ask him to forgive you of your sins and ask him to save your soul / come into you heart. Once you do that and accept him, it'll feel amazing.I will not reply to any replies of this post bashing my beliefs or trying to 'prove' them wrong.Most of my friends are atheist and are extremely surprised whenever they find out my religious beliefs, because I am extremely rational, logical, and practice 'good' science. My atheist friends respect me, and consider me more intelligent than most people they come across as I dispel a lot of negative stereotypes they previously held about religious people. I will reply if you have any specific questions OP, but if anyone wants to bash what I wrote with your beliefs or you proof against God don't bother. I won't respond.

I want you to go out to a fancy restaurant, and try one of those things on the menu you've always seen but never had. Something you've wondered about since the first time you saw it, but could never muster up the willpower to get it, because too expensive, chance of me not liking it, blah blah blah. For me, this is broiled sea cucumber at a chinese food place in nyc. Just as one last adventure, before you die. You can even have someone get it to go and have it in your bed. Or it doesn't have to be food. Just give yourself one little adventure, one little freedom to do whatever it is you want, before you might not be able to again. Even if you really don't want to right now. ", " >>6990464I was being serious, although at first I was joking. The succeeding part should tell you that.We all come here because we are interested to see what it is, and we all stay here instead of running like hell because we feel some attachment to the people on the boards, basically, we are all pretty much some degree of insane. No one is arguing with this. And yes, a bunch of us are pretty much incapable of feeling emotion. Not me, I'm crazy in other ways, not socially. But when autism tries to feel emotion for other things, it puts a lot of effort into it. And the result is threads like this, which are a lot more meaningful and sweet than facebook pages that say things like \"he was an hero to us all.\"It's really a pretty interesting phenomenon. I work with legit retarded kids, and they are a handful, but when you aren't well or need help, they are some of the most comforting people to be around. This is similar to that except a lot less severely autistic.When emotions come naturally to people, they do not put as much effort into things that they should. When you are a fuck who laughs at gore pictures and says \"normies\", you have to try your hardest. And it turns out way better.Also, I'm only open to rping DARK sonic at night in a meadow.

Why is any of this (including ourselves) happening? It's infuriatingly mysterious. Sadly, I think we'll both die without an answer to that question. It's like we woke up in some bizarre realm that shouldn't exist, but against all common sense, does.I'm not convinced we know much about anything very deep. We've got our science, technology, and mathematics, and that stuff is all really cool and impressive (by our current standards), but it doesn't seem 'deep' to me. It just feels like we're playing around with something far far beyond our comprehension. I think we're a long, long way from really understanding reality. So I hope you don't feel like you're going to miss out on anything really earth-shatteringly amazing. Even if you lived a long full life, I don't think the world will be substantially different than how it is now. Everyone alive now will be dying in a profoundly ignorant state.But it was cool learning what little we learned. We had some fun intellectual adventures together. At least in death you won't have to face the unpleasant parts of living. Many (most?) of us struggle through life. I know I do. I often go to bed looking forward to being unconscious for a while because I'm tired and sore from my job and the stress of dealing with everyday annoyances. I also think that we often psychologically torture ourselves throughout our lives - accumulating more and more baggage and hangups over time. It'll be nice for all those problems to evaporate.I'm going to stick around for a while and try to figure some of this shit out, but I'm not far behind you.

Hearing for example can be learned by the brain even as an adult. It still is a hard time for formerly deaf brains to learn the process of analyzing sounds and shit, but its possible, since those neurons are now used constantly for information processing and undergo relatively fast neuroplasticity. Things like patience you mentioned are porbably harder. How would you make a child impatient in the first place? Patience is not really a specific processing area of the brain like the senses and training that aims to make a baby impatient would affect a whole lot more, so its not predictable. There havent been much developmental deprivation experiments. The Nazis did some, there are some feral childs, but all in all not really enough to make solid developmental studies, although it lead to some hypotheses afaik. Modern developmental studies are ofc done on more or less healy children, so you understand what parts of the brain are important, but you cant see what would be if you fucked it up and tried to do it later. Generally I would say, yes, neuroplasticity works always, so to some extend the brain can compensate early losses, but to what extend is unknown due to missing studies (luckily we should say).
