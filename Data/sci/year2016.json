This could be explained if there was a large quantity of matter spread throughout the galaxies that only interacted with other matter through gravitation. Its why dark matter is \"dark\" - if it doesn't interact using electromagnetic force, its literally incapable of producing light. The sizes of galaxies is juged by their effects on other galaxies, their rotation rates, and their brightness. Except for the dark matter, which only influences the first two. Now, most people here are memeing >reality doesn't match theory>make up undetectable particles to explain error except that these \"undetectable particles\" aren't necessarily undetectable and they explain the observations really, really, really well. They're just really fucking difficult to detect because they only interact through gravity, and gravity is really, really, really fucking weak on laboratory scales.Nearly every physicist and astronomer has seriously considered different theories, especially the idea that gravity is different on large scales. There are currently several different theories out there competing (badly) with dark matter. But like every other theory, they have to successfully explain current observations, and every other theory is either very messy or fails miserably. What helps a lot is that when you look more into particle physics, the idea of a \"dark matter\" particle isn't weird at all. Its just a particle that only interacts via gravity.

Errors in prediction can be used to update inadequate models depending on the certainty (precision) of these errors.People think that neuroanatomical and neurochemical abnormalities mean that precision of prediction errors are amplified so schizophrenics update models of the world abnormally.Prediction errors are also suppressed in order to attribute agency. Because a major problem of the brain is how do you differentiate between sensory input caused by yourself and by the rest of the world? By using prediction information from frontal-motor parts of the brain to suppress prediction errors in posterior sensory areas. obviously external influences wont have motor-frontal predictions so external prediction error wont be suppressed in the same way. the easiest example of this you can do on yourself is that you cannot tickle yourself but other people can. this is an example of motor predictions from yourself suppressing sensory information on your body when you tickle yourself. schizophrenics tend to be able to tickle themselves.frontal and temporal (where auditory is) means that we dont suppress auditory prediction errors from internal thought properly and misattribute it to the outside world.

IIRC, many of these purported researchers use tools like \"Implicit Bias Tests\" as evidence to support their conclusion, but I don't see how this can be considered valid. I myself have taken 2 of these tests; one for racial bias, and one for sexual orientation bias. Anecdotally, as someone who is politically independent, and a white bisexual male who has, thus far, only dated other non-black men (I'd chalk that up to chance, not bias), the test prompts concluded that I preferred blacks and straight people. How can these tests be measuring \"bias\" when they could simply be measuring my speed/accuracy in correcting recently memorized associations when assigning descriptors to categories? Does your handedness factor into it (the test directs you to use keys operated by each hand)? The claims that these tests actually measure implicit bias towards demographic groups seems more like political ideology than science. Could you not make people take associative bias tests for categories that are truly neutral (like shapes for example) and rationalize it with the same conclusion that I prefer squares to triangles?The only other research I am aware is a study showing infants prefer adults of the same skin color, but even then, this strikes me as something that can't necessarily be extrapolated to adults.

But I guess I'm wondering if there are any further neuroscience studies, maybe even brain scans, anything more empirical than simply this test? Are there any better studies out there? Because this is what I see presented most often as evidence for implicit bias by a lot of \"social science academics\" these days. ", " >>8471997The goal of those tests isn't to tell you \"wow anon you're a fucking racist,\" the goal is to see how easily you register connections between things (in this case, like/dislike and race or gender). The real implicit bias research comes from studies that then use these results and correlate them with other things. For instance, there was a study that found that higher white preferences were correlated with offering better loan deals and lower prices when selling cars to whites as compared with blacks. This is not the same thing as measuring open and conscious racism, but rather is designed to get at the underlying biases that people in a society which sends out certain messages have. I can post a few papers on the research that comes after the test if you're interested, but I'm on my phone atm so it probably won't be for a while. As to your second point, it turns out that race/gender/sexual preference don't have a huge influence on implicit bias. Over half of blacks display some degree of prowhite/antiblack implicit bias. One of the professors I studied with (a black man) even said he stopped listening to a lot of \"black\" music because of the fact that a lot of it devalues black lives.You're right of course that it can't be 100% accurate but there are a number of studies that find similar correlations at similar strengths between IAT scores and experimental results.

Could it not be measuring reflexive, short term memory and your ability to accurately and rapidly forget and relearn new associations based on instructive prompts?>This is not the same thing as measuring open and conscious racism, but rather is designed to get at the underlying biases that people in a society which sends out certain messages have.Well I understand that's what some academics and researchers are trying to say, but some of the same people are also pointing towards this type of research as \"the underlying cause of a Trump presidency\".I'm still not seeing how these tests measure bias. Could you not argue, regarding the loans/prices study, that the conclusion of bias measured was actually caused by statistical averages regarding credit scores or loan defaults of those demographic groups? That is, is implicit bias causal, correlative, or non-causal and how do you know?And would it not be true that, using the same test methodology used in IATs, you could show what would be argued as \"implicit bias\" between arbitrary or meaningless categories such as Triagles vs Squares, Squiggly lines vs Jagged lines, Kiki vs Booba (thanks Ramachandran), etc.?

The point about whether implicit biases are correlative, causal, or confounded by some other factor is interesting and one that I have considered, but for the loan study at least (from my memory, still on the bus headed home) the applicants were all given identical credit scores and histories, so whether or not demographics play a part in the usual course of business, in this case applicants drew from a set pool of credit scores, jobs, etc. so I'm not sure if it would make a big difference.

Al. 2010 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1471567this isn't a particularly strong paper since it falls into some of the issues you talked about (is it really implicit bias or is it a third confounding factor, or something else?), but it does seem to indicate that there is a correlative relationship between implicit attitudes and other attitudes or actions. ", " >>8472264>you're correct that showing relationships such as triangles vs. squares would not be particularly meaningful, but that is also a different categoryI think my point is that I'm trying to demonstrate a potential fault in the methodology. If you were to show that there are comparable or even identical frequencies of mistakes and response times with, say, racial groups as you would when answering questions regarding something as elemental as triangles vs squares, would it not be reasonable to conclude that those results being concluded as measuring bias between racial groups may actually be measuring something else more fundamental than bias in how our brains and nervous systems are wired?That's why I bring up possible confounding variables such as handedness, reflex time and a person's ability to forget previous associations and then quickly operate within new ones. The tests seem (to me) to measure how quickly and accurately someone is able to switch from an initially memorized associative framework and then quickly switch to its inverse while that initial framework is still fresh in their minds. Yet it seems those rather basic results are being extrapolated to draw a very complex conclusion in which perhaps an uncountable number of confounding variables may come into play.>in this case applicants drew from a set pool of credit scores, jobs, etc. so I'm not sure if it would make a big difference. I suppose you could argue that even if a black person did have an identical credit score to a white person, there is still that greater statistical possibility (on average) that the black person would default, perhaps due to limited reliability of credit scores as a measurement, or due to some variable not being reflected or captured in their credit scores.

Maybe I'm confusing it with another study, but there was one that showed that defendants who were deemed by the jury or judge to be more ugly were also more likely to receive harsher punishments and/or convictions than those who were considered more attractive. Using an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense, considering physical appearance (ugliness or attractiveness) is in many ways, a means in which animals detect genetic fitness and compatibility among members of their own species. It could be argued that it's a way for a species to unconsciously seek to preserve or propagate genetic fitness within its own population. I'm not sure how this could apply to race or ethnicity though.>>8472383>AND more importantly that there are actual real world instances where the measured association lines up with action is so important.

That's how our society and judicial system should operate, and I'd like to think that it does most of the time, but still, we're dealing with very ancient and primitive structures of the brain that, in many ways operate unconsciously on our decision making processes (if you could even argue that humans actually have free will, but that's a whole other can of worms). Education is probably the best way to suppress those sorts of emotionally driven \"reptilian\" parts of the brain concerned with social hierarchies and dominance among social animals.Regardless, concerning the criminal justice system, it's probably the best system we have at the moment, since wide-scale brain rewiring and manipulation would be a monstrous and ethically fraught proposition. Maybe we would eventually be able to construct some completely impartial AI that would be capable of accurately discerning guilt without any inherent biases, but that solution, too, comes off to many as rather inhumane. With humans at least there is the capacity for mercy, whereas with something emotionless and impartial there is none.

An object that is less dense than the material it is floating in will float completely on top of the fluid (no part will be submerged because it is less dense).3. Normal continental crust, even when it is cold, is less dense than the ultramafic mantle rock. Therefore, it 'floats' in isostatic balance on/in the mantle and cannot subduct.4.

That is, heat is released as core material compresses, but once that particular material has released its heat, it doesn't release more unless it's compressed further.A lot of the heat of the Earth is also due to friction, but it's friction that happened a long time ago, when Earth first formed. Earth was once a band of dust as wide as our current orbit around the Sun. The dust spent a long time attracting closer and closer together, becoming denser and denser until it began to form into a planet. As all that dust collided, each with slightly different velocities and trajectories, a lot of heat was created, and some of that heat *even now* has not yet escaped the planet. It's *still* cooling.Lastly, there are a lot of radioactive isotopes in the mantle and core of the planet. As they break apart, they also release heat.

Gas giants like Jupiter that have no internal fusion are still warm in the middle.It's all about conservation of energy. Planets are made from huge clouds (later, discs) of material that gradually forms up into a ball over timescales measured in the billions of years. All of that matter has a huge amount of potential energy relative to the center of mass, so as the planet forms and matter falls inward, all of that (formerly) potential (now kinetic) energy has to go somewhere. Some of it gets sent away by flinging out small pieces of material at very high speed, but most of it turns into heat. It takes a very long time for that heat to radiate away from the center of a large planet, because there is such a thick blanket of shit on top of it. Additionally, more heat is brought down to the core any time material falls inwards within the magmasphere. >>8290885I think it's about half, maybe a little more. So you are probably correct.

That equation will tell you how to find the energy associated with a force acting over a distance, I guess, but that's not the only way energy is expressed in the physical world.

While the flat face and the sagittal crest are definitely suggestive of a great ape, those teeth and that snout immediately rule out any Great Ape. The only primates with a long protruding snout or dentition quite like that is a baboon, or a lemur, but they have a much more gracile face.Compare >>17970948's dentition and snout with that of a baboonhttp://mysite.mweb.co.za/residents/mwjane2/BaboonSkullFemaleMale.jpgA chimphttp://www.skullsunlimited.com/userfiles/image/variants_large_3163.jpgA lemurhttp://www.connecticutvalleybiological.com/isotope/s/sp3087-a1694fa4.jpgA gorillahttp://www.boneroom.com/uploads/4/8/1/1/48118243/s521972503441136676_p1274_i1_w744.jpegAn orangutanhttps://www.a3bs.com/thumblibrary/VP761/VP761_01_1200_1200_Orangutan-Skull-Pongo-pygmaeus-male.jpgAnd a spider monkeyhttp://www.educationalbiofacts.com/images/CA-RB0825-Vervet-Green-Monk.jpgEven where they come close in terms of those massive canines, none have the same kind of long snout with the low-set nose. It *has* to be a baboon. The sagittal crest means it's definitely an old-world primate, so any chance of it being a New World ape, much less bigfoot, goes right out the window. The only question is what kind of baboon is it?In my humble opinion, it very closely resembles pic related- a Yellow Baboon, P. cynocephalus. It has the same flat, forward-facing, heavy and disturbingly anthropoid face, and a sagittal crest. Potentially a juvenile, deformed, or a new species/subspecies, but it's definitely a baboon. A rather cool one, considering how closely it resembles an ape. But no prospects for being a proto-bigfoot. >>8235128That was my first though too, but the sagittal crest, skull roof and cheek bones are all wrong. Definitely a baboon, though.

Human level AI just isn't that useful to the people with the money. for almost any task, it far cheaper and more efficient to develop a less sophisticated program designed to complete a specific task, in opposition to creating a general human level AI. So the people who have the cash to fund it just don't really have the incentive.2) fear-mongering. most people, being uneducated and having only pop-sci knowledge, think of a human level AI as something like the terminator or sky net: out to kill mankind. most people will have an aversion to strong AI, and as we've seen numerous times before, people don't react well to things they don't like. when we actually get anywhere close to a human level AI, I guarantee that there will be numerous groups dedicated to stopping it, with cries of \"Oh won't someone think of the children\", spreading fear of AIs and hatred towards the groups that make or support them. and unlike other debates, such as abortion or guns, the AI's won't have that many supporters. which leads to3) laws. this can go either one of two ways. if the government ends up fearing AIs, then they'll put in place restrictions, laws, fines, etc. designed to stop their development. (I would say this is the most likely option of the two). the other option is that the government embraces AIs. but, given how the government works, they're guaranteed to go to far, like giving AI's \"human rights\", preventing them from being mistreated or shut off, etc. once that occurs, AI's die because point one just got a lot more important: AI's would simply cost to much. think about the size of the electric bill for running a computer that can actually run a human level AI. and now imagine that, thanks to morons who claimed \"AI's are people too\", you have to keep it running all the time. now it's FAR FAR cheaper to just use a simple AI or just a regular human for a job. and all this assumes that computers can run such AIs ", " >>8194651this board never fails to make me cringe theres always some wannabe psychology ", " >>8197490major* fuk ", " Isn't processing power the real limit?

Next your going to be telling me that we can makes ai's that have \"free will\" and aren't just controled by humans. An AI can't be self aware by very definition, it is litteraly the brain in the jar: everything it knows is quite litteraly just the inputs by humans and computers. It's not actually self aware, it's just told that it is, and is designed in such a way that it can fool you into thinking it's self aware.And when someone says human level AI, nobody (except you) defines that as \"self aware\". People use defintions like this one, from stanford: \"Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines.\" human level AI has absolutely nothing to do with self awareness, consciousness, free will, or sapience. It's about creating an AI that can solve tasks, compute information, overcome problems achieve goals (and learn, depending in who your talking to) as well as a human can. And even if an when we accomplish that, it speaks volumes that you believe that it will be both free of errors and sloppy programming that it will be able to operate on it's own and \"surpass humanity\" without crashing, and that the people in charge won't take either any or enough precautions to prevent it from basically \"breaking out\" despite billions of dollars being put into the development of such a system.

As much as the defense industry and the military loves to waste money, we do it on far more practical things.
