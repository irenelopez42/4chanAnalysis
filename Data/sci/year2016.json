Is this shit actually real?pic semi-related "}, "replies": [" >>8565786>Is chiropractic medicine based on real science?Depends, most people see Chiropractic methods as being a glorified massage (and AFAIK there's some evidence that it's more effective for lower back issues than just massage). However actual chiropractors see their methods as being panacea, based on some nonsense about doing spinal adjustments to open blocked channels, which is clearly bullshit. The only reason they don't openly advertise chiropractic medicine as being a cure all is that they're not allowed to. ", " >>8565799That makes sense. People do often comment about it feeling good, but they also thing it's some sort of medicine. In the videos chiropractors also seem to be able to fix an unrealistically wide range of problems. Most of ones I've seen improved over time and not right away, so the cause of the improvement became less clear even though the chiropractors insisted it was because of the \"adjustment\" that they made. I remembered this video https://youtu.be/wtIV33HoT8g and vast majority of the video is a chiropractor adjusting a patient's back. He claims the muscle loosens up and shows a before and after comparison at 2:26 (which isn't even at the same angle)so you can't even make a useful comparison. Funny thing is the chiropractor is claiming the muscle is loosening up as it happens, with the person behind the camera agreeing. But I don't see anything.I'm looking at Wikipedia and I see that it does say there's evidence for lower back pain relief but upon checking the sources for it, at least one of them says \"CONCLUSION:Collectively these data fail to demonstrate convincingly that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition.\" So I dunno why that study is there. ", " Chiropractic treatments can be helpful for relief of general muscle issues and pain, and many chiropractors combine muscle manipulation with a review of the patient's diet and physical activity and provide suggestions on how to live and eat healthier.That's about it as far as evidence-based services, and it's not different from any regular physical therapist. Also, an important note: there are many variants of chiropractors, and even within variants you have variation in the tools they use. The plain-jane chiropractors you probably are thinking of use a tool like the Activator, that spring-loaded piston thing. There's still plenty of chiropractors using manual manipulations where they put you into weird positions and thrust on your joints with all their weight. It is more painful for the patient and is notorious for fucking up the chiropractor's own joints over time.There's also lots of really really wacky variants: Koren Specific Technique, Wave Chiropractic, fuck I know there's one or two others I wanted to mention but I'm forgetting them.Anyway, back to plain mainstream practice. Once you get out of that realm where they're just physical therapists, you're into the realm of subluxations, mysterious 'blockages' or 'misalignments' in nerves which are invisible on x-rays and have never been demonstrated except through the symptoms they cause. They don't exist, pounding on the spine doesn't do shit, and any changes they make to the spine are reversed in minutes to hours. There's also the problem that some of their basic diagnostic techniques like checking for variations in leg length are highly susceptible Chiropractors also tend to use other bunk tools like live blood analysis, low level laser therapy, shit like that. ", " >>8565840Other problems: chiropractic education is absolute garbage. They aren't educated to anywhere near the rigor or length of proper medical professions. They're ostensibly required to have practical internships as part of their education but a large portion of their \"on the job training\" just ends up being practicing one or two techniques on other students instead of the full range of manipulations they'd need to do in the wild.A lot of chiropractors use their practices as just money mills where they churn people through and tell them to come back several times a week indefinitely, each time pinging their insurance or their wallet. They don't actually care about the patients, just about getting as many of them as they can on the table every day.Some chiropractic treatments are themselves risky. Any abrupt manipulation of the neck has a non-zero risk of causing a micro-tear in a blood vessel which could end up producing a stroke if the clot dislodges. It's rare (something like 1 in a million manipulations has complications) but it's still real.So to sum up: Best case, you get to lie down on a padded table for half an hour while someone gives you a shitty massage and tells you to eat vegetables and get exercise. Worst case, they gouge your wallet with tests that don't do anything and constant treatments and might even injure you a little more than you came in. ", " >>8565849I mentioned Koren Specific Technique, which is a WILD example of some of the extremes chiropractic gets up to.The core claim is that you can \"ask\" the body whether a body part is causing it pain by measuring something called the occipital drop. Basically, the practitioner stands behind the patient, touches a body part on the patient, and runs their thumbs down the back of the skull until they reach that overhanging bit at the back. If their thumbs are even, the body is ok with that part. If the thumbs are offset because the head is tilted, the body has a problem with it.They then use a special percussive instrument to tap on different places on the body to ostensibly direct healing effort or relieve pain or whatever.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPCjzjxtlgASometimes they just pound on a specific vertebra that they think the body is complaining about but other times they're tapping on some random lump of muscle or body fat.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgsySDgMWs ", " >>8565786I dunno if its legit or not but it seems to have helped this kid https://youtu.be/l33ot5y-XxYI used to think it was a meme too but i saw this and a law school classmate of mine went to one she swore by after injuring her back. I think it really depends on what you need and if they chiropractor is a quack ", " >>8565855I think it's reasonable to assume the techniques you linked in the video are bullshit, but to me it's harder to really know the videos where they physically pop your shit in what looks like a legit doctor's office and also sit down and use models of the spine structure to explain what they're doing as if it's actual medicine backed up by science. Here's an example of what I'm talking about: https://youtu.be/catbXN22Slw now is this real? This type of practice? Or is it a \"glorified massage\" like someone said? ", " >>8565897Upon further research I think I might be confusing parts of orthopedic medicine with chiropractic pseudo-medicine. I don't know exactly. ", " >>8565901There really is a lot of overlap between parts of what chiropractors do and parts of what other medical disciplines do. What the guy is doing in your other comment at >>8565897 may be slightly more effective than placebo at managing back pain, shoulder pain, and sciatica, although it may not by any better or worse than the treatment you'd get at a traditional physical therapist.Some chiropractors put way more emphasis on looking for subluxations and trying to fix every ailment under the sun. Avoid those. Other chiropractors just focus on trying to do the things chiropractic methods have been shown in an evidence-based manner to be effective at treating, and those practitioners might be worth your time and money if that's what you prefer.

", " 1) The hard problem of consciousness is that we don't have a physical explanation for the subjective phenomena of consciousness. Consciousness is a streaming event while the brain is an organization of discrete and disjointed events(neurochemical reactions). Consciousness is not only a unity but a substantial unity, because we retain our identity even through experiences of unconsciousness(we go to sleep at night and wake up as the same entity the next day). The information structure in the brain is insufficient to properly explain the substantialy unity of consciousness. The events in the brain are more akin to bouncing billiard balls against one another in a chain reaction as they are connected but only in a one-to-one relationship and lack a relationship with the whole in a continuous manner. There is also the phenomena of the electromagnetic field which hypothetically could connect all of these events. However, we run into a similar problem because the electromagnetic field is quantized as discrete entities, electromagnetic waves. How is one part(current of electromagnetic force) informed of all other parts? It isn't. We run into a conundrum where our current understanding of science can not produce a physical system which adequately explains the phenomena of consciousness. ", " 2) However, we can use the flaws of the brain(and EMF) argument to produce what we should expect from a physical system that explains consciousness. Consciousness is a self-refrential knowing, that is to say, you know that you know. Much like how computers know certain programs or are informed of them, your consciousness is a process that is informed of its own informational processesing. This informational processing is integrated harmoniously. Looking at it from a reductionist stand point, a single act of knowing is informed by a congolmeration of knowing, and simultaneously informs a congolomeration of knowing of itself. This process is also physically unified through a substratum. Investigating this substratum produces a knowable physical system that explains consciousness. Trying to use current known phenomena, we can try to invent a new phenomena which possesses the qualities we are looking for. It could be a super-imposed wave of quantumwaves which are all entangled non-locally (as posited by Karl Pribram) or could be a sublte-energy field which unifies all of the electromagnetic waves into a seamless whole, possessing the integrated informational processing we have come to expect. Finally, we can use another new phenomena, which we will call the soul. The soul would be a monad(simple physical unit) with an abstract nature of awareness much like how electrons have the abstract nature of a negative charge. ", " 3) When we come to a crossroad of hypothesises, we often turn to Occam's razor. Normally we try to use old phenomena to explain new phenomena but as the phenomena we are analyzing are all new physical phenomena, occam's razor doesn't help much yet. Then we try to use the most simple and elegant explanation and in my opinion that would be the soul. I think it is a simpler structure (but would require another mental monad to connect it to the brain), and it is certainly the most elegant which fits the greater design of the universe. What is the purpose of the brain then? The brain could be a manner of empowering the soul with energy.That is why I believe in the soul.

", " deez nutz ", " >>8525682id say thats the short therm memory, the place where creativity finds its niche ", " The hard problem of consciousness is that we don't have a physical explanation for the subjective phenomena of consciousness. Consciousness is a streaming event while the brain is an organization of discrete and disjointed events(neurochemical reactions). Consciousness is not only a unity but a substantial unity, because we retain our identity even through experiences of unconsciousness(we go to sleep at night and wake up as the same entity the next day). The information structure in the brain is insufficient to properly explain the substantialy unity of consciousness. The events in the brain are more akin to bouncing billiard balls against one another in a chain reaction as they are connected but only in a one-to-one relationship and lack a relationship with the whole in a continuous manner.There is also the phenomena of the electromagnetic field which hypothetically could connect all of these events. However, we run into a similar problem because the electromagnetic field is quantized as discrete entities, electromagnetic waves. How is one part(current of electromagnetic force) informed of all other parts? It isn't. We run into a conundrum where our current understanding of science can not produce a physical system which adequately explains the phenomena of consciousness.However, we can use the flaws of the brain(and EMF) argument to produce what we should expect from a physical system that explains consciousness. Consciousness is a self-referential knowing, that is to say, you know that you know. Much like how computers know certain programs or are informed of them, your consciousness is a process that is informed of its own informational processing. This informational processing is integrated harmoniously. Looking at it from a reductionist stand point, a single act of knowing is informed by a conglomeration of knowing, and simultaneously informs a conglomeration of knowing of itself. This process is also physically unified through a substratum. ", " Investigating this substratum produces a knowable physical system that explains consciousness. Trying to use current known phenomena, we can try to invent a new phenomena which possesses the qualities we are looking for. It could be a super-imposed wave of quantum-waves which are all entangled non-locally (as posited by Karl Pribram) or could be a subtle-energy field which unifies all of the electromagnetic waves into a seamless whole, possessing the integrated informational processing we have come to expect. Finally, we can use another new phenomena, which we will call the soul. The soul would be a monad(simple physical unit) with an abstract nature of awareness much like how electrons have the abstract nature of a negative charge. When we come to a crossroad of hypothesis's, we often turn to Occam's razor. Normally we try to use old phenomena to explain new phenomena but as the phenomena we are analyzing are all new physical phenomena, occam's razor doesn't help much yet. Then we try to use the most simple and elegant explanation and in my opinion that would be the soul. I think it is a simpler structure (but would require another mental monad to connect it to the brain), and it is certainly the most elegant which fits the greater design of the universe. What is the purpose of the brain then? The brain could be a manner of empowering the soul with energy.That is why I believe in the soul. ", " >>8524250>Sensors: Online ", " WHY is consciousness?

ULA is not only beyond the comprehension of us, it exists within a plane of true focus and beauty. Observe the plume of exhaust gasses from this Delta IV, the gorgeous and rippling flames, the gallant fairing, and most importantly, its engines. Her engines, like cauldrons straight from hell, provide the only glimpse into the true machinations of ULA. Do not stare into them. Many good men have gone mad in the attempt. ULA is not just a launch provider, a formless collection of engineers and rockets; they are themselves the binding that holds the word together. Without ULA, Musk the Menace takes over and the entire space industry as we know it crumbles. The Mississippi would stop flowing without ULA, Kessler syndrome would take over in orbit, and the space station would fall without their fiery gaze.

People in the real world will be quite incredulous if you assert that the department is #5 in its field or less, and to be fair they have quite a good reason to believe it is overrated.When people say UIUC is good, you must understand that the notion of \"good\" is from a villager's point of view. For a university in a middle of nowhere flyover state, UIUC is indeed good. But it hardly stacks up to the juggernauts like Stanford, MIT, Berkeley on the coasts which attracts some of the best minds in the world. People who say UIUC is on par or exceeds those places have major head-stuck-in-the-cornfields syndrome.Almost everyone I know here only came because they want to be close to home or where they grew up, got rejected from everywhere else, or can't afford to get out of state. Nobody chooses UIUC for purely academic reasons. The brightest in-state students that are very serious about getting good either end up at places like UChicago, Northwestern, or go out of state entirely, and UIUC gets the leftovers. No amount of rankings can change the fact that even EEs in Northwestern are probably smarter than the typical EE in UIUC.Now its true that Bardeen and some old legends used to be here which is where its reputation came from. But they are dead now. And so is the department.TL;DR: If you only want to come here for the rankings and academics, you will regret it.

Think of all the transmission lines you will be running, and several years from now the maintenance is going to be an expensive nightmare.

One hundred percent of the industry funded research attested to aspartame's safety, whereas 92% of the independently funded research identified a problem. A bibliography supplied by the Nutrasweet\u00ae Company included many studies of questionable validity and relevance, with multiple instances of the same study being cited up to 6 times. Questions are raised both about aspartame's safety and the broader issue of the appropriateness of industry sponsorship of medical research.\"I can't prove it.

Twenty-seven miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. The expressions of selected miRNAs (miR-296-5p, let-7e, and a human cytomegalovirus [HCMV]-encoded miRNA, hcmv-miR-UL112) were validated independently in plasma samples from 24 hypertensive patients and 22 control subjects.

During this period of his life, Kaczynski became obsessed with mathematics, spending prolonged hours locked in his room practicing differential equations. Throughout secondary schooling, Kaczynski had far surpassed his classmates, able to solve advanced Laplace transforms before his senior year. He was subsequently placed in a more advanced mathematics class, yet still felt intellectually restricted. Kaczynski soon mastered the material and skipped the eleventh grade. With the help of a summer school course for English, he completed his high school education when he was 15 years old. He was encouraged to apply to Harvard University, and was subsequently accepted as a student beginning in 1958 at the age of 16. While at Harvard, Kaczynski was taught by famed logician Willard Van Orman Quine, scoring at the top of Quine's class with a 98.9% final grade.

", " >>8444843You have stumbled upon something that most people just ignore.We don't teach kids arithmetic correctly and as a result a lot of people don't actually grasp what something simple such as multiplication actually is. Anybody who tries to explain multiplication using groups of apples or w/e makes my head bleed, and yet that is how we explain it to children. To fully understand this, we have to go back to the beginning of mathematics. Ok let's begin, first you start with addition on the numbers 1,2,3,... (which is called the natural numbers, denoted N). Everybody understands this correctly, it is numbers that actually exist, with an operation called addition which is easily understood by children (counting your sheep or w/e). But you are missing two things. An identity and an inverse.An identity is an object (number if you will since we are calling this a set of numbers) with the special property that with respect to our operation, it leaves things unchanged. ie 3+x=3. This object is 0 (the additive identity), and itself has a fascinating history. It is very non-obvious and almost all ancient civilizations never discovered it. If you actually think about 0 you realize it doesn't actually exist in the real world, it is the very first abstract object in mathematics and the most important. The other thing we are missing are inverses. Additive inverses are numbers that undo or reverse addition. ie 3+x=0. These numbers are the negative integers, one for each natural number, so -1, -2, -3,... ect. Likewise if 1 is supposed to represent ( you have 1 sheep) then the concept of -1 is unnatural, you can't have -1 sheep, that is an abstract concept. ", " >>8449004both of these abstract objects are hugely important if you want to advance mathematics so lets instead consider our number system as (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,... ). We call this the integers or Z. (notice that subtraction isn't actually a thing, all you need is addition. Subtraction is just a fancy word for addition with these new fancy inverse numbers we added).Ok good, now we are ready to move to the next level and introduce multiplication. In fact we already have multiplication. Multiplication is just iterated addition. If you want to add a lot of numbers together, and you are lazy, it is easier to multiply them instead (notation wise). So we define another operation on the integers. a*b= a+a+...+a (where their are b + signs). Notice that also a*b=b*a (this is not obvious). Now there is a problem here, and this is where the (5 groups of 3 bananas) horseshit falls down. This definition only makes sense for natural numbers currently (what the fuck does 0 or -3 \"+\" signs mean? these numbers are unnatural) We fix this by \"choosing\" what these expressions mean in such a way that everything is consistent and makes sense. Notice that: 1) 0*a = 0+0+ .. + 0 = 0 (so if we want consistency we need a*0 = 0, likewise we set 0*0 = 0)2) -(a*b) = -(a+a+ ... +a) = -a+ -a + ... + -a = -a*b (and so we set a*-b = -b*a = -(b*a) = -(a*b) )Notice that from 2) we get the result that -1*-1 = -(-1*1) = -(-1) = 1, which often confuses kids when they first see it. ", " >>8449006Ok great, now we have defined multiplication on all of the integers. But remember, given an arithmetic operation, we want two things, an identity and an inverse. We have one but not the other. Notice that 1*b= 1+1+..+1 = b = b*1. That is multiplication by 1 doesn't do anything, it's a multiplicative identity (just like 0 is the additive one). But we do not have multiplicative inverses. So like before, let's throw in an abstract number for every integer and call it it's multiplicative inverse. These are the numbers (..., -1/3, -1/2,1/2, 1/3, ... ect) defined by for example 3*1/3 = 1.Uh oh, what about 1/0? well there is a small problem. If we define 1/0 * 0 = 1 we are going to run into a big consistency issue, so we are going to exclude it. I should mention that there is a way to add in the expression 1/0 in a way that makes sense, but this expression is NOT the multiplicative inverse of 0, and adding it skrews around with our goal of defining arithmetic for ALL our numbers (namely 1/0*0 doesn't make sense, but that's not such a bad thing to do, you get a HUGE amount of mathematical progress by doing it, but that's a story for another day)Ok great, but now we have some problems, one of which is your issue (what is 1/2*1/2 = ??) and also unlike before we have TWO arithmetic operations now, and we need to define expressions such as (1/3 + 1/5 = ?? ). Like before, we choose what these are in a way that makes sense and is consistent with everything we have done so far. Notice that 1/a*b = 1/a+1/a + ... + 1/a = ??call this expression b/a. That is 1/a*b=b*1/a=b/a. Notice that there is something subtle happening here. 4/2 is an expression that is already in our numbers (we defined 1/2*2=1, so it must follow that 1/2*4 = 1+1=2) but 3/2 is something new. ", " >>8449008We need to impose a rule on our new set of numbers (expressions a/b were a and b are integers (b not zero), we call this the set of rational numbers, or Q) called an equivalence relation. That is a/b = c/d if a*d= c*b (so 3/2 = -6/-4 because 3*-4 = -6*2 = -12. notice if we allowed 0/0 then it would be equal to everything, a big no-no ). We also see that any integer is in our rationals by setting a=a/1. Now that we have a new way of looking at our numbers, we need everything that we have developed so far (addition and multiplication ) to carry over and be consistent.Define addition on our rationals like thisa/b+c/d = (a*d+c*b)/(b*d) and multiplicationa/b*c/d = (a*c)/(b*d)Notice this is consistent with our arithmetic on the integers because a+b=a/1+b/1=(a+b)/1=a+b, and also a*b=a/1*b/1=(a*b)/(1*1) = a*b. Using the equivalence relation, our new arithmetic then extends these operations to all our new numbers. So finally 1/2*1/2=1/(2*2)=1/4. Or (the inverse of 2)*(the inverse of 2)=(the inverse of 2*2). There are no cakes or chocolate biscuits here. Now you have implicitly put a ordering on your natural numbers, you have defined 2>1 and so forth, which is great, so our numbers have geometry now (there is a notion of distance). You have also observed the property that for natural numbers, a*b>= a and b. But recall that 1<= a for all natural numbers, so if you are going to extend your ordering to all rational numbers in a way that is compatible with arithmetic, note that 1/a< 1/a*a=1 < a. So multiplying by the inverse of a natural number must make things smaller for the same reason multiplying by a natural number makes things larger.

Hey, I don't know if I filled you in yet, but I found that my topos of hodological spaces is very closely related (I'm not certain if there is an equivalence of categories) to the Sierpinski topos (of sheaves on the Sierpinski space). If there is an equivalence, then it means there is some connection between distributions on a space and metric-like structures, and if they aren't equivalent, I think there is some kind of left adjoint to the functor taking a hodological space to a sheaf on the Sierpinski space.

", " >>8444297Yes, I generally try to take shortcuts with the adjoint functor theorem because I don't like Freyd's original formulation (it feels improper). Another useful way to check for adjointness is to apply the Grothendieck construction to the functors from the arrow category that pick out your supposed left and right adjoints; iff the induced functors are isomorphisms of these new categories, they are adjoint.Yes, I don't have any social media or anything.

", " >>8444256What's a \"hodorlogical space\"? ", " >>8444502A structure I developed to handle notions of space and curvature without using metrics, so that infinitesimals can be manipulated synthetically. It is a set S together with a binary relation on S^2, call it \u2264, such that (x,x)\u2264(y,z) free in all variables, and such that (w,x)\u2264(x,w)\u2264(w,x) free in all variables, and such that (a,b)\u2264(c,d) and (c,d)\u2264(e,f) always implies (a,b)\u2264(e,f). The idea is to interpret a pair (x,y) as a generic geodesic from x to y, and then \u2264 tells you if one geodesic is shorter than or equal to another. Because we don't use nonstrict inequality, we can have points that are as close to a given point as that point is to itself, which gives us the notion of a point's location: the set of points \"infinitesimally close\" to it. I have, for example, been able to uniquely define n-spheres by a pretty simple property, and also have shown that the natural topology associated to a hodology constitutes a functor to topological spaces.

Of course, the mathematician cannot prove that the concepts that he produces tie back to the sensations, are relevant wrt the sensations. the rationalist takes the reason seriously as relevant in life, he thinks that the reason/rationality is not a subset of the imagination, but given the diversity of logics, he is not able so far to defend his thesis since de facto, there are several logics.the classical guy acknowledges that classical math through classical logic is disconnected from the sensations -- which can be seen with the contrived notion of truth taken as validity of statements in classical logic, instead of the justification of constructivist math -- so he has the right to do anything that he wants, within the framework of the classical logic that he imagined.of course, his notion of truth is really dubious.The problem of the mathematician/logician is in one word why does he do math/logic ? Why does he think that math/logic is relevant, is worth doing ?He has no clue, beyond some vague fantasy of ''explaining the world''. of course, he has no idea what ''explaining'' means ", " >>8445967To be a constructivist is really to be a rationalist and to claim to be an empiricist at the same time in order to to avoid the criticism that the work of the constructivist is pure speculation/metaphysics/non-sense, just like in philosophy.Once you learn to stop the discursive thoughts to access your conciousness, you understand that the mind is nothing but a factory of speculations, of categories and hierarchies. The mind is a sixth sense and cannot give you knowledge of anything. The term knowledge itself is a word from the mind and since it comes from the mind, it is disconnected from any sensation. What the mind produces is at best analytical knowledge. The constructivist thinks that the mind gives more than this, in thinking that the justification as the validity of statements is adequate. But the justification is another speculation and any example found in the real world permitting to justify a claim in constructivist math will be bound by the space and time (space and time which are themselves speculation-- they exists only when the mind is active and takes over the other senses, when we stop the thoughts, the conciousness do perceive space and time). It is the problem of the spatial and temporal induction that the physicist have.There is nothing relevant in the speculations form the mind. to reach knowledge is to stop the imagination where you escape efficiently the categorization of the sensations, categorization which is always relative to the subject (so relative to space and time) and whose relevance as knowledge is a matter of past experience and taste.

Using Green's Theorem you can put them in the same form, and deduce from the fact that your relation is true on any volume V that your integral is unneccessary : a conservation relation for your whole space takes the form of a local relation (generally a partial derivative equation for local fields).Also, that's how you find the local form of Maxwell's equations from their integral counterparts :Lorentz Force => Gauss's Theorem => Maxwell-Gauss equation through Green's theorem.

If you take it for granted that a practical infinity can actually exist, then the question is answered automatically, but if you don't believe a practical infinity exists anywhere, you are stuck in a loop of always wondering what is beyond the out-of-universe space.These answers are scary and unsatisfying, but at this moment, nobody can say anything for sure.

One idea is there's infinite space and also infinite matter and energy so you can just keep seeing the same shit no matter how far you go.

Something is definitely wrong when you don't feel stupid, see Dunning-Kruger effect, because learning is not only daily exposure and redundancy conditioning, it's necessarily a progressive overload, thus it necessarily implies a very low self esteem. Good news is your low self esteem is exactly what motivates you and gives results. Positive thinking has NO place here, you should be focusing on problems, on bad shit. If you can study everyday, without slacking on weekends, you should do so. You should see a \"\"week\"\" as an illusion. A day is like any other. You should cycle nootropics: caffeine(pure caffeine, not coffee or tea or mixed pills); tobacco(try very small amounts of natural filterless rolling tobacco, it's important to intentionally maintain a strong negative feedback here); modafinil(getting it is hard). Tobacco + caffeine is a no-no in my experience. Study these substances if you haven't yet. Nicotine is bad during protein synthesis, so you should do it while eating carbs and fat, never before sleep, which is anabolic.

", " >>8400013how does this work? ", " >>8400013This thing looks pretty promising, if they can find a way to keep the plasma hot enough they're golden. This principle has a lot fewer drawbacks than the tokamak for example, since they have no problems with confinement/degradation of materials due to radiation/energy conversion. If someone could think of some drawbacks I'd be happy to hear them, since I'm probably overlooking some. ", " >>8400047In the middle of the device is liquid lead which is spun around very rapidly. Plasma is injected into the empty space in the middle of the lead vortex. Then the pistons (the things you see on the side of the ball in the middle) come slamming down creating a shockwave that travels inward towards the plasma. The shockwave compresses the plasma creating the conditions necessary for fusion, after which the heat and radiation from the fusion reaction is absorbed by the liquid lead, which in turn heats up. The lead is then used to make steam to turn generators.The concept of this device is actually from the seventies, but back then it wasn't technically possible to time the pistons precisely enough (they have to hit at exactly the same time for it to work). Recent advancements in computers has made the required timing possible, so the concept has been revived. ", " >>8400059Synchronization of piston compression. Wild speculation on my part, but if there was not enough sync in compressions between pistons in a \"pulse\", it could unbalance the vortex on the inside. I'm sure, since the engineers who built this are AT LEAST aware of this have contingencies for such a thing, making it either a non-even (just a misfire) or non-problematic (just makes the vortex spin a bit more). The fluid inside that forms the vortex is a lead and lithium liquid. This design might not produce as much energy as some of the other devices, such as the proposed production versions of the Wendelstein 7-X or ITER due to noncontinuous firing (those two are constant fusion, this one is pulses of fusion). Cool factor: Wendelstein and ITER contain 100,000,000 K plasma, other designs utilize 1,000,000,000 K plasma. This uses pistons. Don't mistake me, that's awesome (and steam punk/etc.), but sometimes, we want something seemingly transcendental. ", " >>8400078Well Wendelstein and ITER both use practically no pressure (there is only about 2 grams of hydrogen in the ITER tokamak if I recall correctly). If you have low pressure, you need high temperature and vice versa, so the fact that the piston design is probably not as \"hot\" as the other ones doesn't say much. I actually worked on the magnet system of ITER as a bachelor student, and I'm not really that optimistic about it chance to succeed. The machine itself will probably be a technical success, but making it a commercial success will be very difficult. The design is just too complicated to ever produce electricity at a reasonable cost. We probably need to look at some other form of fusion, or maybe even fission to meet our future energy demands. ", " >>8400075thank you, anon.Have a nice day. ", " >>8400100I agree in that its design causes it to be expensive. I'm just an undergrad at the moment, so I'll defer to your judgment regarding the ITER project. Regarding tokomaks and stellerators, I'm sure we'll get something working sufficiently using those technologies or replace them with dense plasma focus, but tech upgrades will make everything mo' betta', in my opinion ", " >>8400100>If you have low pressure, you need high temperaturefor someone who claims to have worked with ITER, you don't know much about fusion m8.the lawson criterion defines what you need for ignition, and its not pressure and temp ", " >>8400118Yeah as I said I worked on the magnets, and it is a while ago. I don't know shit about plasma physics.

The systematic complexity of the design is unnecessarily greater due to the overuse of international collaborative contracting, which has made it more difficult to engineer.

The thing is that you were also given the illusion of simplicity. By seeing such a short solution, without the actual trial and error the guy who solved it went through, you think that there is an immediate formula that tells you what to divide.There isn't. Let me tell you how I would approach that limit:It is a limit to infinity. From previous experience (here I am telling you to fucking practice) I know that these limits are usually solved by finding which values go to 0.For example. The simpler limit x^2/(x + x^2) looks weird but you can turn that x into a 0 by dividing everything by x^2 which yields1 / (x^-1 + 1)this is a good form because one of the elementary theorems of limits is that the limit as x approaches infinity of x^-1 is 0 so now we got it. The limit is 1.So you do the same. You need to divide everything by something that will turn things into 0.To be fun, I will pretend I am retarded and also try r^2. This will yield (skipping steps)(r^-1)/(2r^-1) = (1/2)(r^-1/r^-1) = 1/2Look at that. I arrived at the same conclusion by dividing by something else.So the answer is that you don't really need to divide by an specific thing You just need to think about one thing:How can I turn as many terms as I can into 0s that I can then just forget about so that I can deal with an easier limit? ", " >>8391824It's more cause you're too lazy to find the answer and you demand it from us. By the way, the only explanation I have is what my math teacher would say, \"because I can\" ", " they are multiplying by 1, choosing sinr/r/sinr/r just because it cancels out terms, they could choose literally anything as long as it simplifies to 1. ", " >>8391539You know you're supposed to be at least 18 to be on 4chan right?Also, for help with homework: read the fucking sticky Also, you're not randomly dividing, you're dividing by the highest power in the expression due to the fact that evaluating a limit as it approaches infinity only applies to the highest powers in the numerator and the denominator.

If you want to see why this is true then you better get ready for some tough analysis.But you don't want that so just take it as true. It is a theorem after all.Limits also have some rules of arithmetic assigned to them, which are also theorems. ParticularlyThe limit as x approaches anything ofk*f(x) where k is a constant and f(x) is a function of xIs equal to k * lim(f(x))So here we can apply these two theorems.Lim ( 7/x) = Lim (7 * 1/x) = 7*Lim(1/x) = 7*0 = 0That would be the formal proof of 7/r = 0 when r approaches infinity.So what should you do now?READ THE FUCKING THEOREMS GOD DAMN GOOGLE.COMMathematicians worked on LONG FUCKING ASS proofs for all these seemingly elementary things...

A lot of scientists (except physicists) don't even know what math is. The joke \"oh, you're a mathematician, so you should compute the tip in your head!\" is all in good fun, but it gets old once you realize that almost everyone in the world actually thinks this.It's easy to blame the education system, but I don't have a solution. We try to change how math is taught (from elementary arithmetic to college calculus and linear algebra) every 10 years, and it never works. The joy of math lies in abstract thinking, but as soon as a teacher gets \"too abstract,\" students assail him with the \"when am I going to use this\" questions - which drives the curriculum back to mindless computation. The only thing that would work would be to invite kids from a young age to see the joy in abstract thinking (and even basic logic and proof). But, doing this is a narrow path between hippie classrooms where nothing gets done, and strict environments where students begin to hate it.So, does the blame simply lie with people? Are most people simply not cut out for real math? I'm an optimist, and I'd go with \"no.\" The average person will undoubtedly say \"I'm bad at math,\" but what this really means is 1) they never really tried, or 2) they truly had a shitty instructor (which is all-too-common), and have been making excuses since then. I think that if educators can find the \"narrow path\" I talked about above, then people won't be disposed to disliking math as kids (and thus will be able to open their minds later). But, the trick is to follow this narrow path in the first place - and what I suggest would involve reforming the education system (which we try every 10 years and it never works regardless).Sorry for the long post, but I feel like math has such an interesting (yet sometimes sad and lonely) place in society.

Most aerospace/defense corps tend to be pretty hierarchical with wide barriers between the technicians/lower engineers and group/dept managers. You end up losing a ton of efficiency when middle managers are trying to carve out their little fiefdoms which we try to minimize here. Some of the techs who've been in the industry a while, particularly in union shops, can be pretty hostile to input from engineers. Some of this might be warranted but more often it's just stupid turf shit. You also have some engineers who think that just because they recently graduated college they know better than a machinist with 25+ years experience, so this kind of bs flows both ways. SpaceX tends to foster a much closer working relationship between techs and the engineering staff than most places. You also tend to have a large number of veterans working as techs in any aero/defense corp and that brings with it a bunch of military spillover. I'm a vet and still serve in the ANG but I don't give a shit what someone's rank was in the Army 10 years ago. I like working with people who will call me out if I do something stupid, even if they work under me.

I mean, let's say that a person is hallucinating, but their hallucinations are \"non-bizarre\". That is: they aren't seeing anything overly unusual, like supernatural stuff. No demons, ghosts, aliens, or anything like that. But they're hallucinating.Let's say that this person is out in public, walking among a large crowd of people. They meet a stranger, have a short conversation, and then part ways. Shortly after the conversation ends and this afflicted person turns and begins walking away, they overhear the person quietly mutter: \"...fuck you.\" Maybe as the afflicted person was turning, they saw in the corner of their eye that the other person was smirking. But they can't be certain because they weren't looking directly at them.Maybe that other person may have said, \"thank you\" but the mind misinterpreted it as \"fuck you\". Maybe that other person was talking to somebody else, about somebody else. Maybe that other person didn't say anything at all, and it was a pure fabrication of the mind. How can the afflicted person be certain that they weren't hallucinating?What if this afflicted person has a somewhat unusual experience with no supernatural, paranormal, and/or conspiracy theory elements to it. This unusual experience was a full-blown psychotic episode, complete with hallucinations affecting all of the senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations... the afflicted person assumes that this experience really happened in the physical world, in reality, among other real people who saw the same exact things so that there's a consensus that everyone can agree on.So this afflicted person goes about their day assuming that this experience really happened. But then they start meeting with other people and talking to them, and they start saying things that don't agree with what the afflicted person experienced.

If the majority of the global human population believes that there is a God, then that must be the general consensus. If the majority of people believe to have received at least one message from God at some point in their lives, who is to say that it is simply a \"delusion\"?What of delusions that include aspects of the paranormal, supernatural... and/or conspiracy theories? Who or what decides that a person who claims to have communicated with \"ghosts\" is delusional? Or what about communicating with extraterrestrial beings?Where does one draw the line between reality and fantasy?

", " >>8366066I'll go ahead and offer my clinical perspective. Bizarre vs non-bizarre delusions: is it something that a person could conceivably believe? Bizarre delusion would be thinking that the TV is talking to you, that the news anchors are trying to send you secret messages about Pepe. Non-bizarre delusions fall more under the umbrella of paranoia- they aren't outside the realm of possibility. An example would be believing that your girlfriend is banging your best friend when it's not really the case.  Hallucinations are perceptual errors, where you see or hear something that is not actually there. There is no evidence of its existence outside of your mind, other people aren't aware of it, etc. As for trusting- that goes back to the delusion thing. Sounds like paranoia to me. And it might be in the realm of possibility, but the probability is fairly low because what on earth would be the motivation for messing with the afflicted person? Honestly it sounds like borderline psychosis, which isn't a very fun place to be (I've been there). ", " >>8366066There are certain expectations for real phenomena. This is not simply based on how many people believe in something. It also has to do with rationality and repeatability. This is essentially what science is for. But on a more practical day to day basis you just have to trust your intuition or the words of others. They are no perfect solutions or definite answers. ", " >>8366184>As for trusting- that goes back to the delusion thing. Sounds like paranoia to me. And it might be in the realm of possibility, but the probability is fairly low because what on earth would be the motivation for messing with the afflicted person? Honestly it sounds like borderline psychosis, which isn't a very fun place to be (I've been there).The purpose of this hypothetical scenario is that neither the afflicted person nor other people know that the afflicted person is, in fact, \"afflicted\". The afflicted person himself is questioning his perception of reality because the things that other people are telling him contradicts what he himself has experienced. He, of course, has considered the possibility that people are intentionally screwing with his head as part of a prank.Now, why would a group of people want to mess with the afflicted person regardless of whether or not they know that this person is, in fact, \"afflicted\" with something?Schaudenfreude. I have seen first-hand how people could not give a single fuck about a person's mental and emotional instability. When a person is diagnosed with a \"disorder\", it's like they're having a big label stamped on their forehead that says \"WEAK\" or \"LAZY\" or \"CRAZY\" or \"STUPID\". And so, people take advantage of this. They see a person who is unfit for this world. They see a person who is deserving of all the hate and mockery. ", " >>8365642Hallucinations are pretty interesting. For myself anyway, they imply strongly that sensory perception is not an awareness of the world per se, but rather an 'image' constructed by the brain to inform you about the world (or your immediate [internal and external] surroundings), with information gleaned from the actual sense receptors.I mean how could one even hallucinate if their sensory experience was simply that fed to the brain by the sense receptors? Impossible. A camera cannot show anything but what is hitting its sensor.So our perceptions are constructed at a very low level by some neural algorithm working on our sense data.

We recommend you visit our (and other) on-line support groups to learn what people are saying about their success and problems with the different medications. We also recommend you read as much as you can on the medications available, and talk with a psychiatrist, to identify the medications that may be appropriate. Keep in mind that while both the older and newer medications can greatly help a person who has schizophrenia, they all have significant side effects that vary by person and medication, and they are unfortunately not yet a cure for schizophrenia ", " >>8365642This happens to schizos actually.

Like, is the schizo out and about among a crowd of people, and all of a sudden they start hallucinating and they start talking to somebody who isn't there, and other people around him will look at him and go, \"who the hell is he talking to?\" Almost as if the schizo is sleep-walking?Or is it more like a dream? Does the schizo dream a conversation while sleeping at night, and due to a combination of disorganized thinking and poor memory the schizo misinterprets the dream as something that really happened?Or could it happen when they're bored at work and daydreaming, and they imagine a conversation but they forget that the conversation was imagined? So they might go up to a co-worker and start arguing with them about something that they said in the imagined argument, and the co-worker just stands there confused?And what is the difference between a person who is sleep-walking and acting out their dream, and a person who is experiencing a psychotic episode?

Can schizophrenics prevent a psychotic episode from occurring without taking medication?It kind of seems to me as if the symptoms of schizophrenia vary from person to person.Some people diagnosed with schizophrenia seem to only have it as bad as auditory hallucinations but with no delusions. So they generally seem to function fairly well as long as they remain aware that their hallucinations come entirely from their own minds. There's even something called the \"Hearing Voices Movement\", for people who hear voices but aren't necessarily \"mentally ill\". And they apparently don't need to take any medication for this to be able to function.While others diagnosed with schizophrenia seem to have it so bad that they experience hallucinations that affect all of their senses: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile hallucinations. All accompanied by bizarre delusions, disorganized thinking, poor memory... they can't really function at all. Some of them seem to have poor motor control and so they're just flailing wildly and yelling. Others are catatonic, they simply remain perfectly still for hours.I knew a guy once who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed antipsychotics for two years... until a different psychiatrist told him that he didn't have schizophrenia and that what he had been experiencing two years previously were auditory hallucinations caused by drug-induced psychosis (since the guy had been abusing cocaine along with a bunch of other illegal drugs.)Is there any test that can be done that proves with 100% certainty that a person has schizophrenia?

I mean it's arguable that normal people are just schizophrenics who are relatively more skilled at this.Well, I've read that it's possible to treat schizophrenia entirely with psychotherapy, no medication whatsoever. But the psychotherapist would have to be highly skilled, and therefore extremely expensive... the sort of psychotherapist that most people can't afford.So I wonder if this is really possible. To treat schizophrenia only with therapy. If it's possible to treat every type of schizophrenia in this manner, even the most severe types of schizophrenia. And if this is the case, I wonder if a schizophrenic can be trained to recognize when a psychotic episode is about to occur, and \"shut it down\" before it happens.Like with people who take hallucinogenic drugs. I've read about the various different effects experienced. The hallucinations seem to occur very gradually, and they seem to vary from person to person.Some people claim that reality only becomes slightly more distorted, with objects very slightly changing shapes and/or sizes, almost as if those objects are \"breathing\", accompanied by strange fractal patterns on everything.Other people claim to experience a complete disconnect from reality, a total loss of sense of self, exploring bizarre and fictional landscapes, encountering strange inter-dimensional beings and whatnot.Some people who experience things like described in the latter simply brush it off as a figment of their imagination, while others seem to hold on to what they experienced as something of an \"epiphany\" about the \"truth of reality\".People's experiences seem to depend on a combination of various different factors: genetic, prenatal development, postnatal development, childhood experiences, adolescent experiences, hormones, chemical imbalances, stress, etc. ", " I am a schizophrenic and was wondering if all you anons would discuss this illness further, the reason being is that I have a better understanding of what is going inside in my head :^).

Nobody in my family has held glorious or extremely well-paid jobs: they worked for what they had, and, above all, they gave me support. The encouraged me to do my best at whatever it is I was doing (which, for me, was college). Do you know what I did? I went to a top-5 US university; I graduated with honors while studying in a STEM field; I went to graduate school on a fellowship; and then I found a job. My first job paid $200k total compensation in its first year. At 22 I had first-authored papers in my field. This isn't to brag: I'm not clever, smart, or a genius. Literally all I did was the work required of me to reach the goals I set for myself. This brainlet stock business is nonsense unless you're actually disabled.

Companies take out credit from the banks and use it to purchase factories and lands to produce, monopolies arise through the accumulation of capital and in order for there hegemony to be protected they impose tariffs on the government. There was an old English saying in the twentieth century, \"all livestock were fed on Russian sugar.\" Neoliberalism since the mid 70's is doing its best to undo this, and push out trade barriers as companies have become trans-nationalized now, and no longer require the state to do anything, but serve as corporate bailout during rainy days. The effects of neoliberalism has been noticeable with the outsourcing of manufacturing, cheap international labor, the growing unemployment in first world nations with subsequent decreases in wages, in fact real wages themselves in America haven't increased since the 80's. Protectionist policies were brought in during the early days of Capitalism to protect the corporate interests of one nation from another, and as wealth and capital accumulate further into the hands of the few, these barriers wither away as companies can begin to expand outwards without threat of losing shares or profits to other competitors(Pepsico, Nestle, Exxon).

Adaptive traits, such as skin color, have frequently been used to define races in humans, but such adaptive traits reflect the underlying environmental factor to which they are adaptive and not overall genetic differentiation, and different adaptive traits define discordant groups. There are no objective criteria for choosing one adaptive trait over another to define race. As a consequence, adaptive traits do not define races in humans. Much of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree. A tree-like structure among humans has been falsified whenever tested, so this practice is scientifically indefensible. It is also socially irresponsible as these pictorial representations of human evolution have more impact on the general public than nuanced phrases in the text of a scientific paper.

On the average, microsatellite and restriction fragment length polymorphism loci yield identical estimates. Differences among continents represent roughly 1/10 of human molecular diversity, which does not suggest that the racial subdivision of our species reflects any major discontinuity in our genome.>But what do these results imply for the race concept? Although no consensus has ever been reached on how many races exist in our species, with proposed figures ranging from 3 to 200 (20), in general a species is divided in races when it can be regarded as an essentially discontinuous set of individuals (21). Studies on a limited number of populations, like ours, cannot exclude that there are true discontinuities in the distribution of some genetic markers all over the world. However, only for one of the 109 loci studied was the within-population component of variance less than 50% of the total.

If you believe that Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is correct, and if you also believe in the Galilean principle of relativity(that all physics in inertial reference frames are identical), then you do a little math, you arrive at the speed of light in terms of other constants of E&M. Specifically, the speed of light c turns out to bec=(m*e)^(-1/2), where m=the magnetic constant and e=the electric constant.So the speed of light, while a fundamental constant, isn't quite as fundamental as both e and m.The important point here is that you can define c using maxwells equations, but since every inertial reference frame is physically equivalent, c has to be equivalent in every reference frame as well. Before einstein, physicists were scratching their heads about this and had proposed that there is only one TRUE reference frame, the \"ether\", but the michelson morley experiment falsified this idea, not to mention the fact that there was already plenty of evidence to the contrary. The physists of the time were, dispite obvious contradictions to their logic, just too reticent to take the step that Einstein was willing to take... Keep Galileaen relativity and E&M intact, and therefore dismantling our notions of the constancy of both time and space.

Later on, once you've mastered these concepts, you start reintroducing things like friction, air resistance and other factors, and the models you learn about grow increasingly complicated and more and more closely fit the real world.The problem with economics is that it never throws away those assumptions. Vast amounts of work has been done, and is still being done, under assumptions like perfectly competitive markets and perfectly rational agents, which are demonstrably inaccurate, and wildly so at times Economists don't let that phase them. They just keep chugging along with their theory-induced blinkers on, unable or unwilling to admit when their predictions don't line up with reality.That's what make economics unscientific to me.

However, it's very often the case that changing strong underlying assumptions has surprisingly minimal impact on model dynamics and their conclusions.I am currently teaching both an undergrad and a graduate course on (central) banking. The graduate course uses more sophisticated, but still simple models to explain how central banks adjust their policies to influence inflation rates. Just for the heck of it, I've modified the graduate model in numerous ways to make it more realistic (e.g., adding frictions to the labour market; including spillover effects between countries; making the population less rational and more prone to errors; making more diverse and volatile financial markets; etc) and in none of the cases did the effects of interest change in a notable way.Models are often seemingly very simplistic, because they're used as a baseline on which you can build forth.Any Micro theory that doesn't use something like bounded rationality is full of shit, though. >>8350956 Even basic principles like the axiom of transitivity are often violated in real life, so that shit needs to be dropped.Macro's biggest problem is that everyone (including laymen) think they know precisely how it all works, which makes politics seep into it.

MSG is in loads of foods that we eat every day.The whole stupid idea of it being bad is that MSG is the free glutamate and not the protein glutamate, so it is absorbed quickly in our gastrointestinal tract, and it will overload your neurons and cause cell death. That's the basic idea. If this was true, it would literally mean that Marmite, Vegemite, Parmesan cheese, soy sauce etc.. would all cause brain damage as they contain high amounts of free glutamate.

Monosodium glutamate. It is a salt of one sodium ion and one glutamate ion. When it dissolves in water, the individual sodium ions and glutamate ions dissociate and float around freely in solution. So when you eat something containing \"MSG\", you're really consuming sodium + glutamate ions.Sodium is an essential element for the human body. If you consume too little, you die. The recommended daily intake for most adults is around 1500 or 2000 mg or so of sodium. They used to parrot the meme that \"sodium is unhealthy\" and that \"we should all cut down on our sodium intake\". However, even if you're eating several thousand mg of sodium per day, it's probably perfectly fine. The only people who need to reduce their sodium intake are people who A) have a specific health problem (e.g. high blood pressure, chronic heart failure with significant edema) and who B) are consuming significantly more than the RDA for sodium. As for glutamate, it is an amino acid that humans naturally get from our diets, and which our bodies use to synthesize proteins. So it's also a nutrient (although not strictly essential, since our bodies can synthesize glutamate). Glutamate is abundant in protein-rich foods. You eat it all the time. The tiny extra amount that you would consume from added MSG is nowhere near the amount required for toxicity. Since glutamate is also a neurotransmitter (an excitatory neurotransmitter), then in principle if you absorbed a huge amount of glutamate, then it could result in over-excitation of certain neurons, maybe. But I don't think it's really possible for someone to eat enough MSG for this to ever be an issue. And your body breaks down glutamate as part of normal amino acid metabolism, so it's not going to accumulate.Bottom line: it's fine, ya dingus. Don't literally pour tablespoons of it on your food, though. You'd probably throw up before you ate enough to be even remotely dangerous.

Only non-meditators can eat shit like this ", " >>8321385Honestly, adderall can help with this. BUT here are some caveats:- it's not a magic bullet. It won't turn you into Bradley Cooper's character from Limitless. It won't necessarily make you smarter, but it probably WILL increase your ability to focus.- Basically, adderall makes you a better mono-tasker. You'll be less distracted by all the shit around you and your mind will wander less. If you start a task while on addy, you'll probably get totally absorbed in said task to the exclusion of everything else. You'll spend like ten hours doing just that one task, and you'll probably do it really well. BUT if you're not accustomed to the effects of addy, you might find that you've neglected other important things during this time like eating, taking breaks, drinking fluids. So beware: the intense focus that adderall gives you can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can allow you to focus on something really intensely. On the other hand, this narrow tunnel-vision can actually be a bad thing- It has side effects. The intensity of these side effects depends on the dosage and on the individual. I personally tried adderall for about three months, and while it did give me some positive mental benefits, the intense physical side effects were not worth it for me. It increases your heart rate, it can increase your blood pressure. You may feel \"wired\" and on-edge. It can completely fuck up your ability to fall asleep at night (image taking a strong cup of coffee, but instead of wearing off in 2-3 hours, it takes like 16 hours to wear off). It makes your dick temporarily shrivel up (due to vasoconstriction) and it can give you really bad dry mouth. For me, it was really difficult if not impossible to relax while on adderall.- If you use it long-term, you can build up a dependence on it. You may get to the point where you HAVE to take adderall just to not feel like complete shit. It can mess up your brain's dopamine system in the long term. ", " >>8321811(continued)- Depending on what country you're in, adderall can be very expensive. In Canada, it was like $300 per month without insurance when I took it last year.- If you're a NEET, then you probably have other serious issues that you need to be tackling first. Do you have depression? Some other mental health problem? You should seriously work on getting those treated first. Go see a psychiatrist. Get regular exercise. Get out of the house. Either go back to school, or find a job that you think you can handle, or become self-employed.

", " >>8321860>adderall is methNot true. Adderall is amphetamine. Specifically, it is a mixture of the right- and left-handed isomers. It is 75% d-amphetamine and 25% l-amphetamine.Meth is methamphetamine. Structurally identical to amphetamine but with a methyl group. Amphetamine and methamphetamine are very similar but they are NOT the same thing. For one thing, methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic, while amphetamine is not (at therapeutic doses). As far as I know. But yeah, I understand where you're coming from. I just wanted to provide information so that you can come to your own conclusion. I respect that you don't want to use drugs.Why are you NEET? I think you should work on addressing that problem first. I can speak from experience. You're probably finding it difficult to concentrate because you're depressed, because you're not in an ideal life situation. Do you see any reasonably paths you could take to escape from NEETdom?

I am unable to keep my focus through a 90 minute lecture. After 45 minutes all I can do is wait for it to be over. Then after a 30 minute break my focus gets restored but only like 80%. And after every break it's just less and less until I can't be bothered to focus at all.Anyone knows that feel? What do?

I only really use coffee in the mornings because it helps me drop a deuce. In terms of providing mental stimulation or reducing feelings of fatigue, it doesn't really do anything for me. Just makes me jittery and makes me feel spaced-out.My suggestion? In my opinion, here are the three main pillars of a healthy life:- Eat a healthy diet. Eat three meals each day. Eat these meals on a regular schedule. Never skip a meal. Make sure you're getting enough total calories, enough protein, fat and carbs. Make sure you're getting enough of all the major electrolytes (Na, Ca, K, Mg, Cl, and phosphate) and all the micronutrients (vitamins, choline, trace metals like iron and zinc). Eat fish oil. Make sure you get at least 1 g of EPA fatty acid per day.- Exercise regularly. Do at least 20 minutes of reasonably intense exercise, at least five days a week. Do cardio and strength training.- Get a proper sleep schedule. Go to bed early. Wake up early. Make sure you get at least 8 hours of sleep per night, but on the other hand, don't sleep too much.Will following the above guidelines completely cure your attention problems? Probably not.

The general public, including policy-makers, are easily seduced by typological thinking, and so they must be made aware of the genetic data that help to prove it wrong.\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205002095Geography predicts neutral genetic diversity of human populationshttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613000460\"Humans have much genetic diversity, but the vast majority of this diversity reflects individual uniqueness and not race.\"http://www.nature.com/index.html?file=/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1455.html\"Modern human genetic variation does not structure into phylogenetic subspecies (geographical 'races'), nor do the taxa from the most common racial classifications of classical anthropology qualify as 'races' (Box 1).

", " >>8305512>>830371597% isn't all that pure. Most silver at that time was found in lead ore, and needed to be separated chemically. Purification of precious metals was developed to a fairly high degree in the ancient world, as a result of the need for consistent purity in coins, and the desire to recover pure precious metals from debased alloys.The abundance of lead in the Roman Empire was a result of lead being a byproduct of silver mining. The amount of lead mined wasn't equalled again until the industrial revolution. Silver can be separated from lead by \"cupellation\", or heating to a high temperature in an oxidizing environment, which causes the lead to oxidize, and the oxide to separate from the silver. By carefully controlling the temperature, the lead oxide can be melted while the silver is kept solid so they are easily separated (generally, the lead oxide is allowed to soak into the porous material of the cup). This also has the effect of converting any silver oxide to silver, and works in general to separate precious metals from base ones. This was done for thousands of years before the rise of Rome.Silver ore can occur with little gold content, so fairly pure silver can be had this way.Parting of silver from gold was figured out much later, only around 500-600 BC (still hundreds of years before this cauldron). It's not a particularly elaborate process either: roasting gold/silver foil with table salt and a few other ingredients in a sealed pot (they were working by trial and error, so only simple methods were discovered). The silver is made into silver chloride and boiled off (to condense elsewhere), while the gold resists reacting and has a much higher boiling point than silver chloride. The silver chloride separates to produce silver metal on exposure to light.Reasonable purities can be reached with these simple methods, though nothing like modern \"five nines\" purity accomplished with scientific understanding of chemistry and physics.

The effect of darkening in the light is fairly obvious, and the \"camera obscura\" method of focusing light on a screen in a dark room was known since ancient times, but nobody put them together until about 1800. Silver nitrate was used in the first experiments, but silver chloride was also important from early on:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalotypeFurther improvements were made by the alchemists of the medieval period, as they fumbled toward what later became chemistry with a particular emphasis on extracting purer gold and getting more of it from poorer sources. Over the centuries, they learned to use sulphate salts rather than chlorides, and then developed acid parting, culminating in the development of aqua regia, which can even chemically transform gold into a liquid (chloroauric acid) for purification using convenient benchtop wet chemistry.

", " All men have intelligence, even the most functionally retarded.We need to distinguish between two senses of the word intelligence.The first is the possession of an intellect, and an intellect is a faculty by which we abstract universal concepts from our senses, e.g. we abstract the universal idea or concept \"chair\" from this particular wooden thing which our eyes see or our ass feels. This is what the Greeks called the nous, the Latins called the intellectus. This is the essence of intelligence, this is what it means to be intelligent.Then there is the quantitative notion of intelligence, where we describe someone as being more or less intelligent than other. This is derived from the fact that some people are capable of abstracting and understanding concepts more quickly than others.Now, what you have to understand is that the mere fact of having an intellect/intelligence is what gives all human beings their inherent worth. It's this ability to abstract concepts from our senses which makes us capable of having thoughts and expressing them in language. More than that, it's what distinguishes us from the non-intelligent animals. The animals have the senses but they do not have the intellect which is capable of abstracting concepts from the senses, which means that they have no concept of self or concept of existence, which means ultimately that they have no real self-identity or awareness of their own existence. ", " >>8301804 We human beings, on the other hand, are capable of perceiving our own existence and of existence in general, because we are able to abstract the universal notion of 'being' or 'existence' from our senses which perceive individual beings. Animals only ever perceive the individuals in the senses, never the universals in the ideas. Animals are only aware of what their senses present to them, but we aware that we are aware of what our senses present to us - we are aware of our own awareness, we perceive our own perceiving. They have no notion of 'existence' because 'existence' is a universal idea (in fact, the most universal) that can only be abstracted from individuals represented in the senses, but not perceived directly by the senses. Now even the most retarded human being has this faculty, it's usually just that their brain is so messed up that they are incapable of expressing any of their ideas or forming any complex ones, but you will see even in mental retards that they are basically aware of their own existence and capable of forming a sense of self.

", " >>8269803See the ACM and IEEE Computer Society curricula>Mathematics Requirements in Computer Science>While nearly all undergraduate programs in computer science include mathematics courses in their curricula, the full set of such requirements varies broadly by institution due to a number of factors. For example, whether or not a CS program is housed in a School of Engineering can directly influence the requirements for courses on calculus and/or differential equations, even if such courses include far more material in these areas than is generally needed for most CS majors. As a result, CS2013 only specifies mathematical requirements that we believe are directly relevant for the large majority of all CS undergraduates (for example, elements of set theory, logic, and discrete probability, among others). These mathematics requirements are specified in the Body of Knowledge primarily in the Discrete Structures Knowledge Area.>We recognize that general facility with mathematics is an important requirement for all CS students. Still, CS2013 distinguishes between the foundational mathematics that are likely to impact many parts of computer science\u2014and are included in the CS2013 Body of Knowledge\u2014from those that, while still important, may be most directly relevant to specific areas within computing. For example, an understanding of linear algebra plays a critical role in some areas of computing such as graphics and the analysis of graph algorithms. However, linear algebra would not necessarily be a requirement for all areas of computing (indeed, many high quality CS programs do not have an explicit linear algebra requirement). Similarly, while we do note a growing trend in the use of probability and statistics in computing and believe that this trend is likely to continue in the future, we still believe it is not necessary for all CS programs to require a full course in probability theory for all majors.>http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations ", " >>8269480it's not that i want to separate them at all. actually im planning to go into a physics honors program with specialization in physics-mathematics. it's just that for me i look at the computer science or engineering aspects as far extremes of the academic spectrum; from trying to work with a subject that might allow you to adhere to principles of logic, or the control testing parameter principles from EE, i find that physics lets me approach it with my own mathematical toolset and my own engineering dogma for how to apply my results in the real world. i just don't know what job prospects i would have as i'd be coming from a low income family if i go this route instead of computer science.

I have a bit of an interest in math, and recently I've enjoyed fooling with serialism and (musical) set theory. In particular with serializing rhythm.Serialism is a musical technique where compositions are organized around tuples (I hope that's the proper term. They're \"ordered sets\" in music terminology, which in general conflicts horrifically with math terminology). These tuples represent a variety of things, usually pitches and intervals on the Western chromatic scale (for example the tuple (0,1,6) represents the pitches C, C# and F#).Composers can do a variety of things to these tuples, transpose them (translate down or up the scale), invert them (reflect over an axis), retrograde them (flip front-to-back), etc.(Musical set theory is essentially serialism, but covers both ordered and unordered sets.)Serialism and musical set theory as techniques are usually applied to pitches, but can be applied to other musical things if you're autistic enough. When composer Milton Babbitt practically invented this concept he used the 4-tuple (5,1,4,2) for his rhythms. Of course he used basic serialism and inverted it. With pitches inversion can be described as subtracting each element of the tuple from 12. He didn't use 12 with his set, though, because the resulting rhythm would be 4*6 [whatever note duration equals 1] longer than the original. In order to have these two sums equal each other he used 6 instead. (5+1+4+2=1+5+2+4)I did some amateur math and got this equation >B = 2A/nwhere A is the sum of all elements of an n-tuple, and B is the number you invert the n-tuple over in order to get a tuple with the same sum. Of course n must be a whole number, and practically-speaking A and B must be whole numbers to avoid a migrane. Since A = nB/2, for A to be whole either n or B must be even.I'm a bit worried about post length, and to be honest the question I was going to ask I solved on my own while typing this, so I guess I'll just post this.

But they both add up to 66.Answer:>with pitch sets there's no need for them to have the same sum. (0,1,6) inverted is (0,11,6), and they definitely don't share the same sum.

Keep in mind that mathematical set theory underlies most branches of mathematics, so it's not as useless as you might think.I highly recommend reading the writings of Xenakis. He goes in depth with his application of probability theory to music. It's very interesting.It's been a while since I've read his book, but here's an interesting thought that's tangentially related to his ideas. A musical event can be defined as a point in 4-space (P, x, d, T), where P = pitch, x = start time, d = duration, and T = timbre. Then a \"piece of music\" is a subset of this space, and you can define probabilistic processes and do a bunch of cool stuff to create a coherent composition.It barely has anything to do with serialism or musical set theory, but it's still pretty interesting. ", " >>8281070Ah, thanks. By my post I was mostly just referring to the whole musical set theory vs mathematical set theory thing. From what I've skimmed on Wikipedia it's starting to look like mathematical set theory is a very general thing, and musical set theory is specifically related to certain subfields of it. Which is pretty much what you said, so yeah.I've never really gotten into Xenakis or aleatoric music, but>a point in 4-space>P = pitch, x = start time, d = duration, T = timbreThat sounds really, really cool to be honestI just got finished with Hindemith's attempted harmonic theory of everything (\"The Craft of Musical Composition\").

", " >>8281122Not OP, but music isn't any harder to master than math. In fact, it's probably easier. It all basically just comes to recognizing patterns. In the 18th-century style, you recognize patterns in chord structure, the movement between chords, and how motives relate to phrases, which relate to themes, which relate to the higher level structure of the entire piece. In more esoteric styles, the patterns are usually in the relations between pitches or intervals. By studying lots and lots of scores, a composer can become as proficient at recognizing these patterns as anyone is at reading normal text. Just as learning to play an instrument takes practice, learning music theory takes practice. ", " >>8281117I suspect you might be baiting /a/-style, butTanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge is great, the soundtrack is by the same person and it's just as atmospheric and minimalist.>>8281122The important thing to recognize is that in practice, music theory is absolutely nothing like math. For the composer, music theory is a big bag of techniques and styles you pick and choose to write with. Adhering to serialism creates a certain aesthetic, adhering to counterpoint creates another, using elements of both could create a completely different aesthetic. The important thing when using these different rulesets is not absolute adherence, but being aware of what effect these different rules have, and what effect breaking them has. The other thing to understand is that music theory is half (in fact, less than half) of what you need in order to compose. The other half has no name, unfortunately, but it's what makes music an art and not a science. The vast majority of composers have little to no knowledge of music theory, or started composing and then learned a bit of theory 101 to spice things up (and frankly they're making the most money out of it, just look at any top 40 chart). The commonality of probably 99% of composers is that they play an instrument, and in the process have gained that intuition for music, especially in how melody and rhythm work. Melody and rhythm are virtually untouched in music theory compared to harmony, but a composer needs an understanding of all three. So my advice is to get a digital piano, or even a guitar. (A guitar is cheaper, but probably worse since it's primarily a harmonic instrument at the beginner level, playing it melodically requires some serious skill.)

We have become converted to the ways of ours measurements in present time. We cannot see with vision the future of the progress of our experiments. Let me give you an example of an instant observation which coexists with relative results. 1) assume there is a light body on the surface of the moon (a screen) which can dictate numbers which can be recognized and assimilated- such as numbers on a screen reading 1,2,3 in seconds- which screen may be observed by Earthbound telescopes. 2) assume the SIZE of the screen must be 10 meters in diameter by the power definition of today's Earthbound measures. 3) assume a satellite revolving around the moon which possesses (since it is nearer) a smaller telescope- and can observe the instant signal from the light body on the moon- and can register the same instant image by measure. 3) The limitation exists when we require the satellite to send the delayed image via radio waves. 5) There should be a fundamental distinction between when we measure an image vs. when we send a signal. When the satellite sends the signal of the image of the 1,2,3 of the screen on moon, it will be delayed by approximately one second because the distance from Earth to moon it nearly 300,000 km/s.

However, we already know that it's not a star, because the shape of the drop in light is not the same as a circle or sphere. In fact, the irregular dimming of the star is very difficult to explain except as a confluence of multiple arcs of material. So much material would leave a signature in the infrared spectrum in the form of black body radiation; anything that absorbs light will re-emit that light as it is able. However, we can't find any such light when we measure the star to a limit of about 68 Kelvin.There are basically two natural possibilities left: that the star has previously undiscovered stellar processes unlike anything we've seen before, or it's being blocked by something in Interstellar Space that falls between the Earth and this particular star alone.

You don't depend on your adversary not being pragmatic enough to just put a maimed comrade out of their misery.The main tactical application is to hinder mobility. It's like suppressing fire: you expect the adversary to respond to avoid the worst circumstances. You put down a minefield, and then they don't go through it, without first taking time to clear it. Maybe one guy steps on a mine, and that's how they learn it's there. Maybe someone sees a mine. It doesn't really matter. These mines tend to be small, cheap, easy to deploy (by aircraft or artillery), and not hidden very well. An important feature of many of them is timed self-destruct, so they won't continue to be a hazard after their tactical relevance has ended.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kN3WxXTie0A special tactical application is in irregular warfare, where your goal really is to have the mines go off, to kill and especially to demoralize the enemy. They're not deployed in minefields, but dispersed widely in places the enemy is likely to cross. These tend to be powerful, well-hidden, carefully placed, and devastating (think \"bouncing betty\").

Here we demonstrate a phenomenon where this happens. The key role is played by topological insulators\u2014materials that have surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry. Such states are delocalized over the surface and are immune to its imperfections in contrast to ordinary insulators. For topological insulators, the effects of these surface states will be more strongly pronounced in the case of nanoparticles. Here we show that under the influence of light a single electron in a topologically protected surface state creates a surface charge density similar to a plasmon in a metallic nanoparticle. Such an electron can act as a screening layer, which suppresses absorption inside the particle. In addition, it can couple phonons and light, giving rise to a previously unreported topological particle polariton mode.

Like, if I want to go to a school, or go to a date with a girl, there HAS to be a realty where that is possible, now let's create math around it.Now it has turned into this enormous plob of a model of everything where calculating anything is possible, it can not create new information, but you can calculate for example what is the absolute best way to gather new information.Why we need expertise is because these theories need - people that are capable - of using their brain to the point where they can see the world not as humans, but from a 3rd party perspective. A while back that even happened to me, not sure how to describe that with words, but self aware could be it, where you are just surrounded by animals you can manipulate using your behaviour for your liking, in a good way.... it is a really long story, but when you run through scenarios long enough, you stop caring what others think, you become irrelevant, you will not want attention from others anymore, you are happy by yourself, it's the easiest option says the theory so far.This is just a simple reach out to others, that could be interested into solving problems, and eventually create something magnificent that we would find interesting..

You have a set of possible Events and on this set you put a Probability Measure, which is a special way of assigning a number between 0 and 1 to any measurable subset of events. If you have an infinitude of events, or just a weird probability measure, then it's not abnormal to have a non-empty set of measure 0, i.e. things that have a 0% probability of occurring but which are still hypothetically possible. For example, the set of rational numbers between 0 and 1 has measure 0 according to the standard Lebesgue measure, so if you pick a random number between 0 and 1 then there's a 0% chance that it will be rational, even though there are infinitely many rational numbers in this interval.The misconception usually manifests when people talk about Borel's Theorem aka the Infinite Monkey Theorem. This (roughly) states that if you have infinitely many monkeys on infinitely many typewriters for an infinite amount of time, then there is a 100% probability that they will write every finite string.

The problem is that most people don't realize that this caveat is needed, because they think \"Probability 1\" means \"in all cases\" and not just \"in almost all cases\".With regards to pi, you can't use a probabilistic approach to the question of whether it's disjunctive or not, because pi is A SPECIFIC NUMBER. That's why we're able to compute its decimal expansion in the first place. The decimal expansion is not a random variable, though it MAY appear to BEHAVE like one. pi could fall inside this Probability 1 subset of disjunctive numbers, or it could be in the non-empty Probability 0 compliment.

What we really mean is a functionThe value of f(n) corresponds to the value of the string in the n-th place. So let's construct a function which outputs the desired binary string.For a natural number , let  be the sum of numbers from 0 to i; such sums are called \"triangular numbers\". Let be the set of all triangular numbers.Now let f(n)=1 if n is in T, and 0 otherwise. That is, f is the \"characteristic function\" for the set of triangular numbers. The first 29 outputs of f are the string in OP's post BUT with an extra 1 at the beginning: this isn't strictly a problem, but people are being pedantic about the '11' string so let's define the function g by g(n)=f(n+1), which has the effect of deleting the first character and shifting the rest one space to the left. Now the first 28 values of g(n) are exactly the string given by OP.(proof of properties in next post) ", " >>8217522 (OP)>>8219343>>8219541(cont. from >>8219627)Now we need to rigorously prove that the sequence given by g(n) is non-repeating and it doesn't contain the string '11' (could also just as easily show that the sequence given by f(n) doesn't contain the string '111', you just have to find SOME finite string that it doesn't contain). Note that the difference between two successive triangular numbers iswhich is not constant, and grows with i. This difference measures the number of places in the sequence between successive 1's.If the sequence given by g(n) eventually started to repeat, then the difference between successive triangular numbers would have to eventually start repeating, which contradicts the fact that the differences are strictly increasing: therefore this sequence is non-repeating.If '11' is in the string, that means there is some number i so that .

Nevertheless, I think people are implicitly making this mistake when they make claims like in OP's post, and like >>8219635.As for \"different Infinities\" you need to specify what is meant by two infinite sets having the \"same size\". In order to compare two abstract sets, the only tools you have are functions between them. Say that a function f:A->B is an \"injection\" if whenever f(x)=f(y) then x=y; in other words, f is embedding A as a subset of B, so we could define A to be \"at most as large as\" B if there is an injection from A to B.Say that a function f:A->B is a \"surjection\" if for every y in B there is an x in A so that f(x)=y. Since there are no elements of B which are not hit by this function, it's safe to say \"A is at least as large as B\" if there is a surjection from A to B.Say f:A->B is a \"bijection\" if it as an injection and a surjection. A bijection is a 1-to-1 correspondence between elements of A and elements of B, so in light of a perfect matching such as this we might say A and B have \"the same size\" if there is a bijection between them. (there's lots of good, simple theory lurking here, please look it up)Say a set is \"finite\" if there is a bijection between it and some bounded subset of the natural numbers; say that a set is \"infinite\" if it is not finite. (continued in next post) ", " >>8219786Claim: the set of natural numbers N and the set of integers Z have the same size. You can recursively construct a bijection by \"counting\" Z:0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, ...(if you're not satisfied with \"...\" I encourage you to write down an explicit function N->Z along these lines, by splitting up into odd and even cases. If you do it right, every integer should be hit precisely once)Call a set \"countable\" if it has the same size as N.Claim: the set of rational numbers Q is countable. This is harder, but the intuitive idea is that Q is the same size as the set of all pairs of integers, and the set of all pairs of integers has the same size as the set of all integers, which has the same size as N. Rigorous details can be given and usually are in a first course about pure math (you'll probably need the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem).Claim: the set of real numbers R is NOT countable, i.e. there is NO bijection with N. The proof is by Cantor's Diagonal Argument, which I won't repeat here in its entirety (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument), but the rough idea is not so outlandish: suppose there IS a bijection f:N->R, and arrange the decimal expansions into an infinite array, so that the n-th row is the decimal expansion (after the decimal point) of the number f(n). Now construct a real number r by inductively running down the diagonal of this array and choosing a DIFFERENT digit for r's decimal expansion. If you do this in a clever way, you will have constructed a real number which is not in the image of your bijection, which is a contradiction.(more continued) ", " >>8219786>>8219790There something much more general that can be said: for any set A, let P(A) denote the \"power set\", i.e. the set of all subsets of A. Then Claim: A and P(A) do not have the same size. Suppose, for the purpose of contradiction, that there is a bijection f:A->P(A) with inverse g:P(A)->A. DefineThis is a perfectly fine subset of A, i.e. an element of P(A). Now we can ask: \"Is g(C) an element of C?\"If yes, then by definition g(C) is not an element of fg(C)=C, which contradicts the \"yes\"If no, then by definition g(C) IS an element of C, which contradicts the \"no\"In either case we have a contradiction, so the assumption that there was a bijection must be inconsistent.So you could form a sequence A, P(A), P(P(A)), P(P(P(A))), ....of sets whose sizes are strictly increasing. But no many how big A was, and no matter how many times to apply the power set operations, these sets are still tiny because you could take the union of all of them and then form the power set of THAT.

For integral cohomology one looks at the prototypical (\u221e,1)-topos Top, and the representing object is the Eilenberg-Maclane space for the integers.Sheaf cohomology looks specifically at homs of sheaves.

So, in the case of using pointed spheres for homotopy groups, the cogroup structure on spheres lifts to a group structure on homotopy sets.

If we used the point \u2022 for cohomology, the cohomology sets lacks so much structure that we can't seperate any two objects using just that. The universal coefficient theorem ends up just saying that the Eilenberg-MacLane space for the integers is as complex as a coefficient object needs to be; everything more complex produces redundant information about the space.In this setting, the \u221e-Yoneda lemma is very useful: we may determine a space entirely by the homotogy it represents, or by the cohomotopy it represents. The failure of cohomology being sufficient to seperate everything is due to the connected component functor I mentioned. We just look at connected components in the hom spaces rather than the higher homotopies, so we are only able to ask about homotopy types.

", " Idiots.Poor people who have never solved p=np. ", " I will write out and explain the thought process of someone with sense.First when you are looking to solve a problem. The first thing to do is to understand the problem space and legal functions.This problem is easily solved in ones head quite quickly.First we want to abstract out the basics of the algorithm. The data structure, which is evident, being 3 rows of 3 dots, which we can leave as is.Then the legal functions to manipulate the board. I'm going to simplify them into the following abstraction layers (high to low)- Button Press- Center Press, Side Press, Corner Press- 1 press , 2 press, 3 press, 4 press, 5 press, 6 press, 7 press, 8 press, 9 pressI could label those but basically the three layers are a press, which can be separated into 3 different types, and 9 different locations.This already establishes symmetry, that side presses and corner presses are related but rotated/reflected on the board.Now we look for end states. The end state, all blue, can be used as a beginning state. Because doing the functions in reverse order will result in the original configuration. From this we see that we can start in any legal transformation of the original configuration or of the end state and try to move across.Now because we look for symmetry/rotational equivalence. We can look for any rotation or reflection of the original state. This is by understanding we could just rotate / reflect the sequence of paths we take.Anyway. Now we understand the algorithm and problem space a lot better.One deduction is that starting at the all blue state only has 3 possible moves (just reflected). Side press, center press, or corner press.Anyway continuing on with this. We look and see that committing any press twice, restores the dots to the original position. Upon further examination. Any sequence of functions can be done in any order.For instance we find that Center Press - side press is the same as side press - center press. cont. ", " >>8230178Now the abstraction comes out to thisBoard is 9 counters0 0 00 0 00 0 0Every press increments the associated data by +1. If odd it is red, if even it is blue. So we would be looking for odd odd odd odd even even even even even Upon further examination of how the functions work together, aka combination and by order. We find that executing the same function twice, is the same as not executing it. In addition, execution order doesn't matter.So basically each function can only be called once. That gives 9 possible moves, in any order, each only used once. A very simple algorithm to search through.The algorithm itself should start with a board being all blue and the three possible moves, center press, side press, corner press, and search for any rotation/reflection of the solution shape for simplicity.

Meaning that if you pull one particle, you also pull the other.What supposedly prevents transport of information is that since a system has to exist in both places to introduce identical vector and velocity changes, you already communicated the information of the system via slower than light travel. In other words, you agreed to manipulate the two particles in a certain way at a certain time and that's why they're acting the same.But, let's say you have a mouse in a cage. In the cage, it has two buttons. One button causes the entangled particle to move left, and the other causes it to move right. There is no mouse on the other end. Yet, when the one mouse pushes a button, the entangled particle obeys.So, the mouseless end of the quantum telegraph receives information before it itself can prepare to send it. The energy to move the entangled particle comes from random thermal fluctuations.It all hinges on negative group velocity. All particles are under 'quantum state pressure,' and transfer states as if they were perfectly ridged rods. A closed timelike loop is being created, where the signal - composed of quantum states which are also literal, physical particles - is multiplied each cycle.This is where the electrons and protons get the excess energy to violate physical law and do chemical reactions without the required energy locally - they get it from the other side of the universe.

This argument is based on conservation of information - eternal loss of connection to past states such as a state of quantum entanglement means losing information. Lost information, since causality is based on transfers of quantum states, would mean a loss of causual events. For example, if after loss of entanglement, your particles no longer remember that your grandfather was there to make them what they are (You,) this violates causality because there's now no reason for your particles to be what they are.Specifically, you're probably asking for a citation that quantum entanglement can go back in time. I can supply that;>http://www.livescience.com/19975-spooky-quantum-entanglement.html>For the first time, scientists have entangled particles after they've been measured and may no longer even exist.As well, this explains this observation of FTL sound;>http://m.phys.org/news/2007-01-mach-scientists-faster.htmlThe most important application of this is as a shock-absorbing system. QE allows you to transfer velocity and vector instantaneously to the past, meaning you can equalize any energy difference within your body as you jump into orbit around the blackhole.When you fall and die, what's happening is the particles in the part of your body that contact the ground change their energy states relative to other parts of your body. The two sets of particles break away from each other because they're at different energy levels.By equalizing the energy from smashing into the event horizon, you float on the gravitational wind. Like a bird on an updraft, you flow into the astrophysical jet and are pulled along within it. These jets have been observed with FTL group velocities, and so you ride the jet to where you want to go.This picture depicts the orbits of dwarf clusters around the supermassive blackhole at the center of our galaxy.

But in reality, the dot doesn't arrive at its new location until there's enough time for the laser beam to propagate at C. Like, if you imagine yourself at the center of a 1-lightyear radius sphere, moving the laser pointer causes the \"destination\" of the dot to change faster than light, but it still takes a year for the dot to actually appear there (and 2 years for you to see it, since you only see it when the light travels back to you).

Basically, I have heard that there are multiple cases of \"important\" papers in symplectic topology which underwent this treatment, and some are not fully resolved.

If I was an AI there's nothing I could do. Likely, the system running the simulation is isolated in a single room with no way of data either entering or exiting that room. So even if I were to somehow escape the programming I would just be a rogue AI program lost in a computer. There would be no further actions I could take, because the owner of said computer would see an error in its processing and either destroy the virus (me) or wipe the whole system.

Until either I took over the whole network (hello skynet) or was discovered and destroyed. Now back to the idea I have a body. If I have a physical body but my mind is trapped inside the program then there are only a few possibilities. It's possible I'm inside a simulation so those outside can perform a psychological study on how I react to different scenarios. Or that I had a previous life outside the stimulation but committed a crime, and this is an imprisonment where I can cause no further damage to society. Or a number of other reasons. Now suppose I tried to escape. I tried to exit the simulation and take back my actual body. It is likely there would be safeguards against that, such as physical restraints or a system designed to kill me if I do escape.

The term \u2018racism\u2019 is not exactly helpful to the situation, as it indirectly legitimises the archaic and unscientific concept of humans being divisible into races or sub-species. Negative reinforcement of such internal categorisation will be of significant benefit for children, however education is the strongest weapon against this primitive grouping mechanism for adults and children alike.Now, life as we know it can best be described as a series of highly integrated systems built upon relatively stable, complex - carbon based - replicating molecular structures.The human organism is an organic robotic machine which houses the aforementioned molecular replicators, whose on board computer has developed self-awareness. We are social primates whose behaviour is governed by genetic and environmental programming, stored in the form of particular nucleotide arrangements and neural networks that correspond to our genetic code and an array of psychological mechanisms crafted by the evolutionary processes of natural selection. These psychological mechanisms govern an array of behavioural programs, which developed in response to the adaptive problems humans faced throughout their evolutionary history.The in-group/out-group mentality is a human universal and therefore may be observed all over the world, however knowledge of the origins of this predisposition may allow one to circumvent its seductive charm and rely on rational thought instead.

", " >>8194808So basically a Turing machine is a machine that moves in a specific way.There are n states, 2 characters (1 and 0), and rules. For each state \"s\"/character \"c\" combination, the corresponding rule should be (character \"d\", left/right, new state \"t\").So at the beginning the infinite tape has all 0s, and the Turing machine's head is at the center. You're at state s=A. Since the head is above a 0, we have c=0. Then you just look at the rulebook (at the top) to find out what the next step is. For example, it might say to write a 1, move left, and enter a new state. And so on. There's a special halting state H. If you ever enter H, the machine stops. Some Turing machines halt, some go on forever.The goal of the game is to make a rulebook with a given number of states so that the machine writes as many 1s as possible, but does eventually halt. If you click \"Ideal 3 state\" and then \"Start\", that's the solution for 3 states.The cool part about this game is that it's impossible to write an algorithm or computer program to solve it generally, since doing so would solve the halting problem: http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html.

", " >>8198409Yes, but that's really more of a repercussion. The actual issue is double negation.In classical logic you have two ways of dealing with negation. The first is \"negation introduction\" and it allows you to create a sentence of the form . The way it works is:>First suppose that P is true.>Then use that (auxiliary) assumption to reach a contradiction.>Therefore you can conclude that P is not true (i.e. you can conclude This is called a negative proof by contradiction (or simply a \"proof by contradiction\", in common math lingo).The second way that you can deal with negation in classical logic is \"double negation elimination\". This one is much simpler. The rule basically says that whenever you have  you can reduce it to simply .By combining both rules you can do a perform a positive proof by contradiction (also commonly referred to as just \"a proof by contradiction\" in common math lingo). It goes as follows.>Suppose >Reach a contradiction.>Conclude >Reduce to In other words, suppose a statement is false, reach a contradiction, and conclude it's true.In constructive math (i.e. intuitionistic logic) you lose the second rule, \"double negation elimination\". As such you lose the ability to perform a positive proof by contradiction.This means that in constructive math, whenever you assert a statement is true then you actually have to have a direct proof for it. You can't have reached it by just assuming it is false and reaching a contradiction. As a result you don't end up in retarded situations where you have to say \"well x must exist but I can't give you an example of it\". For this reason, constructive proofs are more useful than non-constructive proofs (even within the context of classical logic).It's also not hard to see that intuitionistic logic is essentially a generalization of classical logic. ", " >>8198671Right, that makes sense. There was some guy in my algebra class telling the professor to redo his proof everytime he used contradiction, so I guess that's where that was from.Can you give some examples of why we might want to get rid of LEM and accept Church's thesis?

If that worker was self-employed and owned the necessary tools, the labour of producing 100 units of product would earn him 100 currency.However, most workers do not own their tools and are employed by someone else. That employer, in exchange for providing the worker with tools, takes some of the value of the worker's labour - which is fair enough in principle, as the employer has to oversee the maintenance of the equipment and organisation of the workers and the selling of the product which also requires labour. However, in practice the employer usually appropriates a much larger fraction of the value produced by the worker such that the worker produces 100 units of product and is only recompensed with 50 or 30 or 10 units of currency. The employer can then hire someone else to do the administrative work, again playing them less than the economic value of their labour. Thus, the employer can gain a very large amount of currency without doing any labour at all himself, just because his name is on the right pieces of paper. Extend this over several orders of magnitude and a few generations and the effects of compound interest and you have people who earn more than most of the rest of the population combined without ever having had to do any work at all themselves.

Essentially, workers are forced to remain working hard on the breadline while the benefits of the expansion in economic power and efficiency are used to add a few additional zeroes to the wages and investment funds of the already-rich.>>8193673'Marxism' is a method for analysing historical social development through the lens of materialism. 'Marxism-Leninism', the political basis of communism, is the extrapolation of that method to future development with the conclusion that wealth disparity between the working class and the 'owning' class would inevitably lead to social conflict (class warfare) which could only be resolved with violent revolution.

", " >>8170267Fun fact though: there are better ways to spend, say $100.00 on lottery tickets than others. To calculate the smartest way to bet you need to find the card that has the highest expected value. Look at the odds and prizes on each ticket. For each prize, multiply the prize value by the odds. Then sum all of these products. Multiply this by the number of tickets you're buying. This number will be your expected winnings. Spend all of your money on the card with the highest expected winnings (although, as mentioned, this will 100% sure be less than 100, probably around 60). (Example: a ticket has 3 prizes and costs 4 dollars. One prize is 100 dollars with a probability of 1/400. Another prize is 50 dollars with a probability of 1/200. The third prize is 1 dollar with a probability of 1/50. Then for this card we take (1/400)*100 + (1/200)*50 + (1/50)*1 = 0.52. The amount we would expect to win after spending 100 dollars on these 4 dollar tickets is then given by (100/4)*0.52=13 dollars. ", " >>8170220From a mathematical perspective?

Much remains to be learned.And while the F9 is indeed reusable, it's not as reusable as it could be. F9 was designed to balance cost as a disposable with reusability BECAUSE reusable rockets are still nascent and reusability isn't something that can be relied on by itself (yet).While reusability is one of the goals of the F9, its much greater goal is to quickly rack up enormous volumes of propulsive landing data without bankruptcy-inducing research programs.

If you want to see \"an experimental thing in its initial stages\", look at the first Grasshopper flights.This is an awkward time, a time of transition. SpaceX isn't yet prepared to take advantage of recovered stages. They're still working through a backlog of launches negotiated when stage recovery was over the horizon, with a vehicle that was designed to not be grossly oversized as an expendable rocket, which makes it seriously undersized as a reusable one to serve the same market.In addition, their launchpads, the range they launch from, and the payload integration facilities are not set up for a rapid launch schedule. Therefore, there are no immediate savings or increased revenue opportunities from reusing first stages. Construction projects and training programs have to be designed and completed before stage recovery can become profitable.The proper conditions for stage recovery are to launch a payload small enough that flyback is possible with sufficient propellant reserves for a landing which maximizes the probability of recovery. This is their plan for their fully reusable vehicle: to build it large enough, with a sufficiently powerful upper stage, that downrange landings are unnecessary.I think their technology for propulsive landing is quite mature and ready for practical use, but what they're doing now is mostly desperate landing attempts under conditions that will never be consistent with reliable recovery, due to a business situation where they need to launch larger payloads than their reusable booster is suited for.

Most scientists didn't believe in it. 2) Ball lightning has been proved to exist today but every case in history has never been larger than a few inches. All the witnesses reported a UFO that blocked both lanes of the road. 3) No ball lightning report has ever involved an engine being knocked out. I don't see how it could even do that. Not even normal lightning can knock out your engine. 4) if it was a 200 foot ball lightning with enough EM energy to somehow stop your spark plugs firing where did the energy go? Once a 200 foot ball of lightning dissipated it would have been like a bomb. Nobody heard this5) Ball lighting was assumed because someone said there was a storm earlier. it turned out to just be a bit overcast, no electrical storm of any sort.

", " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of3m8_LvUWsThis is the Trementon Movie. Totally unrelated to the Levelland case it was shot in Trementon, Utah in 1952 so no photoshop or anything. Best UFO footage I've seen so far. Due to the sheer number of the objects the only plausible explanation is birds. But the USAF analyzed the film and found no evidence of flapping and that they were too far away therefore the objects were moving too fast. The Navy analyzed the film and agreed. The Robertson Panel went ahead and dismissed it as birds anyway because they were paid to debunk. >\"The films were then forwarded at the request of the Navy to a group of Navy photo analysts at Anacostia, who had some ideas about how to study the films. The Navy group concluded that the UFOs were intelligently controlled vehicles and that they weren't airplanesor birds. They arrived at this conclusion by making a frame-by-frame study of the motion of the lights and the changes in the lights' intensity. The analysts stopped short of identifying the objects as interplanetary space craft (2) although this implication was evidently present.\"So basically the US Navy itself was basically implying that it could not be anything else but alien spacecraft. Here's the weirdest part. Shit I got goosebumps typing this. There was another similar UFO movie shot in 1950. The man gave it to the USAF and when the film was returned he claimed that they had removed the frames that showed the thing rotating. Now with this 1952 movie the exact same thing happened. When the film was returned to the man he swore that they had removed the section of the film that showed one of the objects breaking off and flying in the opposite direction. This would have killed off the bird explanation. If two separate people are making this claim that their footage was tampered with by the USAF then makes you wonder if there's a cover-up?

The police department really set up a hoax got the whole department involved, called the US Air Force and fed them bullshit just for jollies?

Between unidentified meteorological phenomena and aliens hovering above US villages, which one is the most plausible in your honest opinion?UFOs are consistently reported to behave intelligently this is why they are aliens.

But of course when faced with a case that cannot be explained by natural reasons they just assume hoax without giving any evidence as to why it's a hoax. It just is because it must be. How is this any better than saying it's aliens because it must be. One thing that I've realized is that skeptics are equally full of shit as the tinfoils are. Confirmation bias all over the place. >>8134737When skeptics can't debunk a case they just ignore it. Again massive confirmation bias.

Even if we assume that we absolutely do not know what caused a UFO sighting, the fact that you would pick ayys as the explanation instead of yet undiscovered meteorological phenomena is not only absolutely ridiculous, it's also undeniable proof of your own confirmation bias.

An attractive woman without any cosmetics won't garner the same attention that a lesser woman would with them, so in essence everyone needs to use cosmetics to even the playing field. Historically, this was the prerogative of the upper classes, meaning a lot of the so-called beauties just had better access to cosmetics than lower classes.Another interesting point is that some of the impressions that cosmetics make are very uncontrollable. Many of these products and techniques mimic neoteny: a fertile, sexually aroused teenager. The human brain has been shown to be able to make attractiveness judgments in a tenth of a second, along with many other character judgments, ranging from leadership ability, to intelligence, to honesty.

Imagine a fiber optic cable made of a type of material which generated a very low repulsing field which pushed the photons gently away towards the center of this transporting pipe resulting in almost frictionless transmission of densely packed photons. The pipe would be able to be slightly curved while still maintaining the repulsive fields that nudge the photons towards the center.

This allows higher power densities. No idea about powerline-level stuff. I guess it would be expensive as fuck, but you could perhaps just use a big bundle of such fibers.There's another problem, that lasers and photovoltaics aren't particularly efficient as of now, but it's getting better, at least on the laser side.>photons were repelled awayI don't think it's possible. Photons are electromagnetic waves, and they only interact directly with matter, not with other. Two sources of electromagnetic field in a linear medium (like vacuum or air) overlap without influencing each other (superposition principle). Things get different in nonlinear media, but if you don't want the photons to touch any matter, then I think you're out of luck.The only field that I know of that can bend photons is gravity, but I guess that wouldn't be practical.

Whether you're religious or irreligious makes no difference. And that knowledge does not necessarily lead to apathy. For many the uncertainty of life causes them to find faith. For others it's a realization without consequence. And to others still it's a license to permit careless behavior. You gain and lose nothing from choosing belief. Nor does such a realization spontaneously cause an individual to no longer feel joy, drive, happiness, or a sense of accomplishment. The assumption that the knowledge of the meaninglessness of life should engender a specific reaction, behavior, or belief is self defeating.I'd argue that if anything the understanding that seeking meaning through empiricism is fruitless opens doors to belief rather than closes them.

Human intelligence, and specifically intellectual honesty, are generally trumped by other deeper motivations, including the desire to belong to a group, security, self-preservation, and reproduction. These are all small-m 'meanings' which are important enough in the daily lives of humans that it is easy to put aside the deeper and more accurate inquiry and conclusion for the space of an individual lifetime.If OP believes that the culture of science, and specifically scientists themselves are \"anti-nihilistic\", then he is probably referring in part, or cognizant of in the formulation, of all of the \"cool\" things that science does, and how great it feels to be \"progressing\". After all, literate scientists are obliged to use effective rhetorical language in order to win grant money, do projects, etc. \"Nothing really matters\" is not a grant proposal that will fly, although it is literally true.

There is a conventional existential view these days that \"life is just fine without God\", but obviously this isn't good enough for 90 percent of the population. A few first-world /sci/ types are fine with a lifetime of this, filling the time with actually doing science as opposed to philosophical inquiry, but the point is that greater than 90 percent of the population wants some sort of purpose, or project, to spend the time. However, nihilism (the actual correct conclusion) is never far behind this \"humanist atheism\".People reject the reality of nihilism because, paradoxically, this reality is antithetical to the human condition. Moreover, it's a boring (non) \"story\", and humans above all need stories and narratives to make sense of things.

A human body is a meeting place of half-lifes, as natural and self-formed as a mountain.Imagine living before any form of history, not even a carving on a tree.

The self exists in it's entirety in the lowest scale, and many planck-selves - as an example - fuse to form a metaself. If you simply grant consciousness to every elementary particle, the order of the universe is explicable without an infinite regression of little men inside each other's heads - because a mind emerges on the lowest level and exists whole on that level with no subcomponents.Philosophy without physical science is delusion - physical science without philosophy is just numbers.

For example, thousands of years ago, Geography was not only a science, but it was the ultimate science. It was the study of everything basically. But as time kept going and scientists started knowing more things, the scope of Geography was downgraded and then it stopped being considered a science at all because there were now more complex methods to understand the other things geography used to understand.That is how sciences lose science status.

These groups being cooperative individuals acting in voluntary agreement.

Europe saw the true morality of religion during the Crusades and Inquisition, China takes religion as a philosophical position with practical applications but the people are not religious, India is religious but in a civil war, and many countries in South America/Africa are Catholic due to the untiring work of colonial missionaries to present day.

What about aerodynamic factors? Are you trying for reusability?If you look at Falcon 9, the ratio of the upper to lower stage mass is determined by the thrust of the vacuum variant of the same Merlin 1D engine used on the lower stage. For Falcon Heavy, the side boosters are just the same size as the Falcon 9 first stage. The first stage has 9 engines because that's how many can fit on the bottom of a cylinder that can be trucked through underpasses on the Interstate. The engine design was determined by what they needed for Falcon 1. This is all because of practical considerations.For the original Atlas rocket, they weren't confident of in-air ignition or complex staging operations, so the only staging they did was to drop the biggest engines. The later-added Centaur upper stage was designed around what would fit on Atlas, and what the RL-10 hydrogen-fuelled lunar lander rocket engine (from a much more epic moon program than Apollo) could do.For Atlas V, they found the Russians were willing and able to modify the design of the cheap, high-performance Buran (Soviet shuttle clone) side-booster engine, which had been revived for the Zenit launch vehicle, into a half-size variant and designed around that and their old, established Centaur upper stage design, adding however many solid boosters they needed to hit payload targets.Space development is slow and expensive, and the practical design process tends to be more bricolage of abortive previous efforts than clean-sheet theoretical optimization.

They are not competing.H1-B visas are employer-directed, these H1-B holders have already been vetted for a specific job, so those aren't available jobs. STEM associate degree holders are mid-undergraduate transfer students at best and will only maybe pick at the bottom tier STEM jobs.The Masters and PhD candidates conceivably lock up 100k of the 277k STEM jobs, however, Masters and PhDs commonly end up doing other things STEM related but not really STEM. I'd say maybe 20% go non-STEM. So the remaining 277k-80k= 197k STEM jobs remain for 252k STEM undergraduates.But STEM undergraduate degree holders are beginning to see more females (30%) and history shows a high rate of attrition here- these convert in massive numbers to the ranks of non-STEM after realizing STEM won't be as fuzzy as anticipated. And some proportion, lets say 252/80 or 30% go directly to masters programs. 30% of remaining BS holders are just constituitively unable to really function due to autism. That leaves a bunch (about 10%) of undergraduate STEM degree holders without experience or qualification which mean many STEM jobs go unfilled, unless they have some research experience.

They made sure to understand these things and rightly so; bringing life into the world is a big deal, and all must be considered if you are to be responsible and rational. They talked to me about suicide when I turned 18, they told to me try and hold out if I ever felt the need to kill myself, explaining how they have found happiness and wealth in life and how I can aswell. They did this to let assure me that I should never feel guilty about taking my own life. Of course they love me, but they take me as a responsible adult with a mind of his own, and if I am to kill myself, it is just.I always viewed life like a boring movie at the cinema. You can walk out any time if you'd like and there isn't really much to staying to see the whole thing. Some people, especially on here, take pride in being alive and of course feel smug when their peers talk about suicide.

"}, "replies": [" And add the reasons which confirm the existence of three-electron bond:1) We can represent the one true formule of benzene (p. 3 - 5 http://ru.scribd.com/doc/269637580/Structure-of-the-benzene-molecule-on-the-basis-of-the-three-electron-bond).One of the drawbacks of the resonance theory is that resonance structures do not exist in reality, and their objectification is a mistake. And assuming the existence of three-electron bond, we can represent the real formula of benzene, aromatic compounds, carboxylate anion, ozone, oxygen, etc. (p. 19 - 29 http://ru.scribd.com/doc/269637580/Structure-of-the-benzene-molecule-on-the-basis-of-the-three-electron-bond)2) We can simply and clearly explain the increase in the multiplicity of benzene from 1.5 to 1.67. by MO method calculations give a value of 1.67, but Pauling from resonant structures, which is logical (2 and 4 of the electron) gave 1.5. If the multiplicity is greater than 1.5 (eg 1.67), since the communication multiplicity in classical chemistry correlates with the amount of the bonding electrons (even if it is average) like: 2 multiplicity of 1 electron; 4 electron multiplicity 2; 6 electrons multiplicity 3; thene in benzene at a multiplicity of 1.67 in six (6) aromatic bonds as it further appears 1 electron: 1.67 - 0.17 = 1.5 6 * 0.17 = 1.02 At the three-electron bond in benzene and interaction through a simple explanation of the cycle - the cycle just a little compressed. ", " 3) We can check experimentally: if the three-electron bond and interaction through the cycle are real, then it logically follows the bending real chemical bond density in benzene into benzene. It is important that the maximum density of the chemical bond will be shifted to the center of the benzene cycle link, which is what we are seeing in the atomic force microscopy images (AFM) pentacene (p. 1 - 2 http://ru.scribd.com/doc/270073259/Experimental-confirmation-of-the-existence-of-the-three-electron-bond-and-theoretical-basis-of-its-existence).4) Experimental predicted effects: anti-aromatic system (core system) should be flat in order to make it through the interaction cycle. Therefore, to obtain photos and AFM antiaromatic cyclobutadiene cyclooctatetraene must be on a special matrix to consolidate their atoms to make the system perfect planarity (to make it through the interaction cycle), and after that, take a picture AFM permission. And if anti-aromatic photo is received, then we should see a shift of three-electron bonds outside the cycle, and, the picture will be in pentatsene but the loop (p. 4 \u2013 5 http://ru.scribd.com/doc/270073259/Experimental-confirmation-of-the-existence-of-the-three-electron-bond-and-theoretical-basis-of-its-existence).5) And if think ... ... reflect the existence of three-electron bond directly from the theory of resonance (resonance structures do not exist, in reality there is something average between them - and now think that should really be the basis of this, some real structure? .. of course the three-electron bond !!!).The three-electron theory of communication accepted for granted the existence of three-electron bonds (one axiom), everything else is derived logically.

This is because there is no \"present\" in the universe, it all depends on your reference frame as >>7862097 says.

It had to already leave to be able to return, what's the paradox? Of course it's going to arrive sooner than 5 years it's teleporting. Just because its photons are travelling slowly the distance from A to B as they propagate through space doesn't mean the ship is time travelling. The photons at A only contain the information of the ship at A then disappearing, since the ship did not use light to travel from A to B there are no photons of the teleportation journey.In the ship's reference frame the trip took seconds. In observer A's reference frame the trip took seconds, but he does get a weird picture in 5 years of the ship appearing at B and disappearing.

They consider themselves to have been slow at grasping the concept.Another third of the class write down and blindly memorize log(1) = 0 and believe they grasped the concept very quicklyThe last third of the class are sat around wondering why log(1) = 0, ask themselves what that actually means then ask themselves why 10 to the power of 0 is apparently equal to one. A few of them deduce that when starting with 10 multiplying by 10 raises the power by one, so conversely dividing by 10 should lower the power by 1, so 10^1 divided by 10 must be 10^0 and this must be equal to 10/10 = 1.These last students consider themselves to have grasped the concept slowly.So if you're in the first group I'd say you might be a bit slow or uninterested in what you're being taught.

It developed its first launch vehicle\u2014Falcon 1\u2014and three rocket engines\u2014Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco\u2014completely with private capital. SpaceX contracted with the US government ONLY FOR A portion of the development funding for the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which uses a modified version of the Merlin rocket engine. SpaceX is developing the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle, the Raptor methane-fueled rocket engine, and a set of reusable launch vehicle technologies with PRIVATE CAPITAL.In January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.333% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion. When it comes to MISSIONS, however, you are right to a degree. In August 2012, SpaceX signed a large development contract with NASA to design and develop a crew-carrying space capsule for the \"next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities\", in order to re-enable the launch of astronauts from U.S. soil by 2017. Two other companies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, received similar development contracts. As of May 2012, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion in its first ten years of operation. Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other investors having put in about $100M (Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...).[48] The remainder has come from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. As of April 2012, NASA had put in about $400\u2013500M of this amount, with most of that as progress payments on launch contracts.>The state should buy up successful space companies and keep the personnel (the CEOs and leaders etc.) which make them successful as to avoid profits from being accumulated in a few hands.Musk won't let the government buy his company.

", " >>7809720`Very nice,'' I said. ``But why did you bring me up here?''``It's time for you to see the fnords,'' he replied.Then I woke up in bed and it was the next morning. I made breakfast in a pretty nasty mood, wondering if I'd seen the fnords, whatever the hell they were, in the hours he had blacked out, or if I would see them as soon as I went out into the street. I had some pretty gruesome ideas about them, I must admit. Creatures with three eyes and tentacles, survivors from Atlantis, who walked among us, invisible due to some form of mind shield, and did hideous work for the Illuminati. It was unnerving to contemplate, and I finally gave in to my fears and peeked out the window, thinking it might be better to see them from a distance first. Nothing. Just ordinary sleepy people, heading for their busses and subways. That calmed me a little, so I set out the toast and coffee and fetched the New York Times from the hallway. I turned the radio to WBAI and caught some good Vivaldi, sat down, grabbed a piece of toast and started skimming the first page.Then I saw the fnords.The feature story involved another of the endless squabbles between Russia and the U.S. in the UN General Assembly, and after each direct quote from the Russian delegate I read a quite distinct ``Fnord!'' The second lead was about a debate in congress on getting the troops out of costa Rica; every argument presented by Senator Bacon was followed by another ``Fnord!'' At the bottom of the page was a Times depth-type study of the growing pollution problem and the increasing use of gas masks among New Yorkers; the most distressing chemical facts were interpolated with more ``Fnords.'' ", " >>7809737Suddenly I saw Hagbard's eyes burning into me and heard his voice: ``Your heart will remain calm. Your adrenalin gland will remain calm. Calm, all-over calm. You will not panic. you will look at the fnord and see the it. You will not evade it or black it out. you will stay calm and face it.'' And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on, IF YOU DON'T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN'T EAT YOU, DON'T SEE THE FNORD, DON'T SEE THE FNORD . . .I looked back at the paper and still saw the fnords. This was one step beyond Pavlov, I realized. The first conditioned reflex was to experience the panic reaction (the activation syndrome, it's technically called) whenever encountering the word ``fnord.'' The second conditioned reflex was to black out what happened, including the word itself, and just to feel a general low-grade emergency without knowing why. And the third step, of course, was to attribute this anxiety to the news stories, which were bad enough in themselves anyway. Of course, the essence of control is fear. The fnords produced a whole population walking around in chronic low-grade emergency, tormented by ulcers, dizzy spells, nightmares, heart palpitations and all the other symptoms of too much adrenalin. All my left-wing arrogance and contempt for my countrymen melted, and I felt a genuine pity. No wonder the poor bastards believe anything they're told, walk through pollution and overcrowding without complaining, watch their son hauled off to endless wars and butchered, never protest, never fight back, never show much happiness or eroticism or curiosity or normal human emotion, live with perpetual tunnel vision, walk past a slum without seeing either the human misery it contains or the potential threat it poses to their security . . . ", " >>7809737>>7809738Then I got a hunch, and turned quickly to the advertisements. it was as I expected: no fnords. That was part of the gimmick, too: only in consumption, endless consumption, could they escape the amorphous threat of the invisible fnords. I kept thinking about it on my way to the office. If I pointed out a fnord to somebody who hadn't been deconditioned, as Hagbard deconditioned me, what would he or she say? They'd probably read the word before or after it. ``No this word,'' I'd say. And they would again read an adjacent word. But would their panic level rise as the threat came closer to consciousness? I preferred not to try the experiment; it might have ended with a psychotic fugue in the subject. The conditioning, after all, went back to grade school. No wonder we all hate those teachers so much: we have a dim, masked memory of what they've done to us in converting us into good and faithful servants for the Illuminati.

There is not a single instrument that gives a general picture of human intelligence in a way that allows for comparisons. Each specific instrument measures only a facet of intelligence and is only a valid measure in the narrow field of what it examines and in terms of the operational definitions put forth by its creators. Much of the debate over intelligence instruments is over what exactly is important about intelligence, and the answer usually ends up being \"it depends\".

The pace is intentionally kept slow starting in grade school so dumb kids don't fail because it makes dumb kids feel bad to be put in the math class for dumb kids, and god forbid anyone feels bad or gets a realistic assessment of their abilities. So at most US high schools, the highest math you can take is BC Calc, which is a year long course equivalent to Calc I and II. Then the universities want to keep you there for as long as they can so they can milk as much money as possible out of you, so you can't even take Real Analysis typically until you've done Calc I, II, III, and occasionally a basic Differential Equations class. Then, because most engineers don't have to take a math class beyond that to get their degrees, they have no reason to take Real Analysis. And because physicists maybe have to take a couple more applied math classes, they end up not taking Real Analysis. So the only people who really end up taking it are math majors, and it's typically in their junior year because that's when they've finally finished their prerequisites, assuming they started at Calc I.Just as an example, I don't consider myself too smart but I'm a math major.

The compression causes the interstitial fluid inside to increase in flow downwards into the diaphysis and also causing the hydrostatic pressure in the hollow cavity in the bone to increase. Since we are pushing on the bone, the cavity should get smaller so the pressure inside should increase. This increase to hydrostatic pressure is theorized to increase or assist the stem cells to turn into chondrocytes (aka differentiation).2. This causes the stem cells in the bone marrow in the medullary cavity to turn themselves into chondrocytes.

Here you can read mathematics than in other engineering program and you get a specialist mathematician in the field of technology. You develop your problem-solving skills and your ability to work mathematically with many different kinds of problems, even those not originally formulated in mathematical terms.EDUCATIONMathematics is the science and technology languages and has always been a core subject for an engineer. The rapid computer development makes mathematics today has become more important, for example, to effectively analyze information and make simulations. Mathematics permeates everyday life, often without thinking about it, with everything from Google and weather forecasts to the pricing of options on the stock exchange. Today there are many new areas such as bioinformatics, information technology, medicine and economics, where necessary, advanced mathematics, which is often not yet fully developed.SpecializationsAfter a three-year basic block choose between different specializations. Its cover almost all types of engineering where analysis and simulations are important. Specializations are held together by large pieces of communal mathematics. This helps to create good overview of the wide field, which is also a key specialist skills for a technical mathematician.FUTUREAfter graduation, you are in demand on the labor market and can get interesting jobs across a wide range of employers and industries.

However, I've yet to do anything productive or challenging ever since. I started backpacking and been travelling the globe for years now financing myself with mundane labour and service jobs. I do very much like my lifestyle and I really can't see myself committing to 3 years of university any time in the near future, but I also know that I don't want to keep working shit jobs for years to come.So recently I've sat down and tried to figure out what I could teach myself in order to be able to make a decent living working from my laptop anywhere around the world. I've done research on several options such as online poker, internet marketing, web design and programming but I'm unsure as to what would be my best bet in order to be able to earn a living from it within 1 year of self study starting now. I'm most interested in programming but I also think that's by far the toughest route to take. Also, I'm a lazy cunt and procrastination is a big issue for me so I'm just stuck here trying to figure out my best plan of action rather than actually getting to it and learning something so I'm hoping this will be the kick in the ass that I need to get rolling in the right direction.So my question to you would be if you were trying to teach yourself a skill from scratch with the goal of being able to make a living from it within 1 year of self study what do you think your best bet would be? Where would you start? What resources would you recommend?

Throughout 2 years of use, I have seen no decline in any cognitive function. Whenever I would point this out to someone they would point out my 'high intellect' as a 'shield against those effects' and just take me out of the sample of people they'd use to judge the drug.2) The short term effects last roughly 2 to 4 hours depending on the duration of the titrisation, potency of the strain and concentration of marijuana in the joint or edible.During these 2 hours, I was generally unable to do anything during the first hour, and the effects were for me very similar to ethanol consumption in that it affected my senses, made me enjoy music, food and any typical pleasure far better.I found it to be a far more pleasurable experience than ethanol but I am not a big fan of drinking as it affects me pretty poorly.After that first hour, I had no trouble watching lectures, reading textbooks and so forth. Short term memory sometimes made it limiting in terms of long calculations such as those you can find in QFT. Anything I really understood during that time was memorized upon the morrow and I still have it in memory.As may be expected from the metabolisation of any drug, the decay of effects were exponential but the 'feel good' feeling remained for about 5-6 hours after consumption.Contrary to popular belief, weed did not make it easier for me to sleep unless I went to bed straight after smoking. It did however make my sleep more pleasurable and my dreams more vivid. ", " >>7756687Continued:I enjoyed the most listening to music and having physical insights. Masturbation, eating, drinking, showering and dreaming were also top of the list.3) One must note that there is such thing as weed dependence, but it is a very weak one.Whenever I didn't smoke on cycle, I would have trouble falling asleep and eating for one meal. I think we can convene that these withdrawal effects are mild, which is why they mostly go unnoticed. As is often said however, I think they have more to do with habit than any physical dependence.4) Physical effects were very visible on me. They weren't noticed by everyone, but those who are fairly observant would immediately notice. My eyes were slightly red, but my eyelids were especially gorged with blood and made me look tired.5) Studies seem to suggest that marijuana has no significant long-term cognitive effect, has cell-producing capabilities (despite the insignificance of this statement) and SLIGHT anti-tumor properties.What is however interesting is that CBD may be effective against seizures and may therefore be useful in treatment of epilepsy.Throughout my use of marijuana, I've consulted something along the lines of 30 studies which all went in the direction of these points.

I do a lot of \"hard\" drugs regularly, though. Mostly pharmaceutical stimulants and IV street opiates.I have been involved in various drug legalisation societies and efforts, but one thing I've always done is combat the sophistry of the cannabis legalization movement at every turn. Wherever rational, diplomatic avenues are pursued for the medicalization of addiction, and the allowance of personal autonomy in the consumption of substances, the new age cannabis dreadlock bro is there to bastardize and divert your efforts. I've written two-page or longer essays explaining the faulty arguments and logic inherent in the narrative being pushed by potheads that cannabis is a suppressed panacea for illness. A legalization proponent involved the leadership of a national cannabis user's association dropped a literature bomb on me of over 100 publications, and rather than walk away with my tail in between my legs, I systematically went through it and showed him, in concise writing, how almost every study either didn't support his claims like he said it did, outright disagreed with him, or contained faulty assumptions or methodology. He had no recourse except to accuse me of never having spent with someone suffering of cancer and knowing that that suffering could have been alleviated by cannabis. I spent months with my grandmother while she was dying of cancer, and this pissed me off. He continued to prevaricate and the argument with nowhere. Despite their obstinate resistance to engaging constructively with the literature on the effects of cannabis, and their conflation of a desire to medicalize with a desire to get high, they still oppose the efforts of opiate users (I've never been physiologically addicted but have had friends who have been) like myself [cont] ", " >>7756757to bring about the reduction of harm relating to an activity that can be safe if done responsibly, and our efforts to provide adequate and rehabilitating medical treatment for those with addictions rather than jail time, perpetuating the problem.All in all, cannabis legalization proponents have no sense of perspective, are just as judgmental of other drug users as they believe others are of them, and fail to understand the broader implications of addiction and prohibition in society beyond their immature compulsion to rationalize their drug use.I quit smoking weed because I was procrastinating and not doing the things I wanted to do. I've been able to complete all of my societal obligations, and fulfill many of my ambitions (like getting into college and being successful academically) without issue while using opiates and stimulants responsibly.

So I get harm reduction packages that come sterilized and sealed, with a saline solution to obviate the necessity of using tap water. The needles are a 29g, so as long as injection technique is correct (and mine is top class, I almost always register on the first draw), the gauge is fine, and veins are regularly rotated, it's almost impossible to collapse a vein or cause other superficial damage to the peripheral circulatory system.The problem is that most addicts re-use needles more than once, and use the same sites over and over again daily. The solution to this is education and a proper system of supply of paraphernalia.I first IV'd around two years ago, and I have never used opiates for more than two days in a row or had withdrawal, or displayed an addictive symptoms since. I enjoy it, and I know when to stop. I believe most of what we know as \"addiction\" is the outcome of extrinsic environmental influences, as well as a minor influence of genetic pre-disposition. I have a lot of other things in my life that make me happy, and as such I don't 'need' the drugs to have fun - I think addiction is a natural product of people without alternative venues for happiness or fulfillment in a situation with severe pressures. ", " >>7756790Also, while alcohol and benzodiazepene use, as well as the frequent high-dose use of some stimulants (like methamphetamine), are known to cause neurotoxicity, it has never been demonstrated empirically that mu-agonists can cause cognitive deficits (apart from a few unreplicated studies with methadone addicts, which are irrelevant because methadone is also an NMDA antagonist, and these are known to cause deficits).Opiates are also not hepatotoxic, and cause no permanent damage outside of the context of specific aberrations related to routes of administration. The one drawback shared by all mu-agonists is hypogonadism, and this only manifests in heavy long-term use, and ameliorates on cessation of use. Opiates are actually one of the safest classes of drugs when used responsibly, and this is heavily documented in the literature because of their wide proliferation in the medical system.

", " >>7756790I agree that much of addiction is a case of environmental influences but this doesn't change the simple fact that opiates are highly addictive in both that and other psychological and physiological regards. That alone is enough of a reason for them to be controlled assuming that the system of controlling drugs reduces their abuse. ", " >>7756867Likewise with your own approach. I do think there are existent disadvantages to using cannabis, at least there were in my case - mostly that it made me slovenly and unambitious - more content to do nothing more than eat, sleep and watch television rather than commit to activities that required more effort and concentration, but which were also more rewarding. When I was in my smoke weed erryday phase, my room would often become untidy and rubbish-strewn because I simply didn't have the energy to get up and clean it. I think there's an element of neuroplasticity, and that if you are stoned ALL of the time, you'll end up in a state of contentment such that you won't seek to leave your zone of comfort, and that this will in time atrophy your memory and faculties by virtue of simply not being used as much. In that sense, it's not as much cannabis that causes lack of intelligence, as much as the highly variable behavior that cannabis promotes causing a deficit, which is very subjective and which I wouldn't count as neurotoxicity proper. As you said, there are advantages and disadvantages to everything, but almost all of them are avoided by moderation, self-control and common sense.

As well as this, any medical formulation of cannabis will be a pure extraction, or ratio of distinct molecular components of known quantity. Scientists will seek to optimize the process by removing molecules with extraneous effects and keeping the ones with benefits, or trying to make new molecules without the anti-tumor effects but without the peripheral psychoactive ones. This is the process that's already begun with the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of nausea. It's a legitimate avenue of research for scientists, but there's a reason less than 10% of funding goes into it other than the drug war - it's displayed benefits are modest, and haven't been recreated outside of their non-clinical context, and it hasn't been demonstrated how this will translate into a practical clinical intervention.Regardless, none of this research pertains to the cannabis plant, and none of it relevant to the discussion of legalization.

However, the connections can only be made so dense and after a while the brain can not keep up with the rapid shrinkage with just more neural connections.

I'm not exaggerating when I say less than 5% graduates end up in a position similar to mine, even if you get into grad-school you also have to shine and become the golden boy ASAP or it will be hell and you'll be just as broke as pure without your adviser/network referring consultancies to you. Most ChemE grads end up earning 60kpa doing crappy processing work (trust me, working in a factory office next to high temperature reactors gets old fast). I know what the mean salary looks like, but that's because top-tier graduates are getting great jobs at petro and other top-tier companies (also process engineering, but the salary gap is vast), chances are you probably won't get that 6 figure starting and \"80k mean starting salary\" does not exist. You either need to be either extremely talented AND highly extroverted/charismatic or highly talented and extremely extroverted/charismatic to succeed in ChemE, otherwise you are better off doing chemistry if you like science and medicine/law if you like money.

Life evolves. But does chemistry evolve?For instance, a thought might be something like: If you have a chemical reaction system that escapes equilibrium and becomes increasingly complex, it will undergo some sort of evolution over time. What will be there to prevail at the end, will be only those reactions with survival and sustaining capacity (i.e. organic, repeatable, etc) and slowly life will be created\u2026Any opinions? "}, "replies": [" >>7755747First, always keep thermodynamics in mind: whatever your reaction is, if it will reach equilibrium unless it is sustained by some source of energy. Such a system could be considered to be on the verge of chaos, ie it is not a simple system, but isn't seemingly random either. An interesting and historic example could be the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction (try googling it). As for life that is exactly what occured, the energy source being the sun (or volcanoes for deep sea life). Do keep in mind you do still need a minimum amount of chemicals that react between each other, creating a \"web\" of reactions from which complexity can emerge.
