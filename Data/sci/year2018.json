But in general, most fossils you will find for sale will be the genuine article, mostly because the kind you find for sale are super common like my Trilobite. There are a few hard and fast rules though. 1) Judge a fossil not by it's perfection, but by imperfections as busts or casts do not have flaws or texture. 2) Parts of real fossils mineralize, look for evidence of crystallization or rust/oxidation as the real thing should have this in various amounts. 3) Research your source. There are just as many honest retailer as dishonest ones, believe it or not but buying online is safer than buying from random people in many cases. 4) Some retailers are unaware of how to spot fakes and end up with them in inventory unintentionally. One of the most commonly faked fossils are Mosasaur jaws. In many cases the teeth are real, but the jaw bones are not. You can thank Jurassic Park for the influx of fakes when it comes to species that appear in their movies. They also cause a ton of artificial inflation of prices due to surges in popularity. All in all though, you are mostly safe buying available specimens. Also understand that busts and casts may be your only way of acquiring certain species as we know many species from a one-off find, so they are not completely useless. The problems arise from people passing them as the real thing and fleecing people for them.

Any opinions? ", " >>10193381Not sure how interviews work in the States, but I've been to med school interviews for Oxford and Newcastle in the UK. In case it's relevant to anyone, a few tips:You want to make sure that you know the university and what the medical teaching program is comprised of. Oxford asked me about their policy on animal experimentation and whether I was comfortable with it, and Newcastle asked for my thoughts on it being a regional med school that may require students to make a lot of travels to various hospitals in the region for clinical placements.You need to be able to show them who you are, your strengths and weaknesses, and what makes you fit to be (or want to be) a doctor. Make sure you know yourself well before they get to know you.Everyone that gets an interview tends to have academic success, but not everyone is a deep thinker. You should be able to show them your thought process. Avoid giving short answers and put emphasis on how you reach a conclusion if you ever get a scientific question. For example, Oxford asked me why humans had two ears. I didn't know at the time. I thought it would have something to do with determining what direction the sound was coming from, and what property of sound the two ears could compare to do so.Ethical issues are almost always asked about and people often give conflicting tips regarding these. I personally recommend going through all the points for and against each side. This will show the interviewers your rationale and how you justify things, which is what's important, rather than the actual answer. I personally didn't choose a side in an ethical dilemma and that might have made me seem reluctant, lacking the will to take initiative, possibly devoid of leadership skills.Dress properly and have manners, but don't be a try-hard. Medicine requires you to adapt to various environments and personas, most of which can be quite challenging. Don't smile TOO much. ", " >>10194523Holy shit I just came to ask a similar question.

PhDs can be very flexible indeed, especially if you're shit hot on getting funding but you'll probably be able to argue it if you get the right supervisor.That said, if it's something you want to do, tell both sides you're considering it and get some advice directly from them.

An example of a nursing diagnosis is \"that guy is probably going to fall\". If anything slightly problematic occurs, you will basically have to call the physician for help.

I wish they'd teach us more and allow us to do more, but whatever. We are taught just enough to be nurses and just keep that in mind. The rest of the courses are fluff.

This is the story of the first MD/PhD program in Mexico.So, first you'll probably think something along the lines of \"if it is in Mexico its a shit program\" and your reasoning would be mostly sound, but there's an interesting fenomenon in this case. You see, in Mexico the best universities are public, if you go to a private one its probably because you were too dumb to pass the rigurous entrance exam to a public one, and I really mean it when I say it is rigurous. You can say Mexico is a land of retards and the validity of that fact would be up for debate but anyone who has ever heard the word statistics will have to accepts that any country has a few geniuses and savants.This is were this process comes in, the exam to enter in the medical program of the best university in Mexico is an exam with a 66,000 to 1 admission rate. But perfect, you might say that's just to weed out the retard population of the country, and while I would disagree, let's entertain the idea just to demonstrate my point. Now, at the beginning of the med course we have about 1,500 students of the best Mexico has to offer (medicine is by far the most demanded career). But that number is way to high don't you think? Well, that's no problem since at the end of the first year there will be only about 700 students who will pass to the second year (and a lot less who will even finish medicine). But what was I saying about the MD/PhD program? You see, this program, being the first here is something truly special. When you finish the first year you can apply for this program, you only have to be fluent in english, have at least 90/100 in all your classes and then pass an interview. And you got it, you are the best of the best here. Usually there are about 12 people who enroll in this program each generation.This is where hell starts. ", " >>10221273You see, this program is not like US ones, usually in those you take your courses of clinical medicine and there are inbetween periods where you work on your PhD. In this program you take your courses of medicine like everyone else, while also working in a lab of your choosing everyday after your classes. Oh, and you also have to take some extra grad school classes. And if you ever get anything less than 90% in any class, even the ones you take with postgrad students, they kick you out before you can flinch with nothing to show for the time you spent in there.It's common occurence to see students in this program crying or falling asleep while standing up, it is too fucking common. Also, it doesn't surprise anyone when one of us kills himself, no one even bats a fucking eye.Every class of the normal course is taken with people who aren't on the program. And why is that important? Because everyone fucking hates us, you can see the click in everyone when they find out you are one of us, the fucking faces of despise because a lot of them wanted to enter the program but couldn't. Anyway, that's not the worst of that, the worst enemy of anyone in the program is another one like him. As it turns out, when you subject a person to extreme conditions and pressure to excel, tell him he's one of the best and put him in an environment that hates him you create a deeply troubled person who will do almost anything to succeed. Shocker.Usually, the number of people in the program is cut by half at the end of the first year after they enroll, it honestly still baffles me that so many people continue each year. ", " >>10221277This program is still young, it has 8 years running and 8 generations up until now. The first generation just finished the whole thing.And why do people do this? Well, I can't speak for everyone but only for me. Have you seen or heard a genius who has also worked himself to the bone? Who has been to hell and back? Someone who has the talent and the hard work? If you have the smallest doubt, you haven't. At the second you speak with someone from the first generation, you know it, there are obly a handful of people in this world like that. Only a handful. Out of those who just finished, most have secured great positions in first world countries and their lines of research are outstanding. I bet both hands those fuckers are gonna change one thing or two. I want that.Anyway, I dont even know why I started writing this. I think its partly because I wanted to share my struggle and because this is the first time I have some time off in a long while and now I cant stand the anxiety when im not doing anything productive.Anyway, thanks for reading all of this.

In front of you are two squares, one larger and one smaller. Aside from their size, they are indistinguishable from one another according to you. However, if you were perceiving the third dimension, then you would be able to observe that the larger square is actually a box, but you can't. So, for some reason, you decide to try to stack the squares on top of one another. In doing so, the smaller square falls into the larger one, which according to your perception is impossible. What's happened here is that, while the observer is still perceiving in two dimensions, they're still perceiving the effects of an object with third dimensional properties. If, in the real world, we were able to find two objects that have fourth dimensional properties, and to see them interact in accordance with those properties, we could, convincingly, prove the existence of a fourth dimension.

Geometric quantization via classical mechanics and symplectic geoemtry (Woodhouse, Guillemin-Sternberg, Marsden-Weinstein).2. C*-algebraic and constructive QM via local operator algebras, e.g. GNS representation (>>10092747, Haag, Strocchi-Swieca).Both have their pros and cons, 1. Geometric quantization makes explicit the classical intuitions behind QM and the implementation of gauge invariance is straightforward via the moment map. In addition, the topological effects (i.e. A-B effect, Dirac monopole quantization, etc.) are almost immediate. However, such \"nice\" properties rely on some pretty stringent equivariant cohomological conditions, and the continuum limit (i.e. QFT) is not obvious.2. Operator algebras and the GNS representation is a purely C*-algebraic construction, namely it is completely independent of whether you're in a QM or a QFT setting. In addition, the QFT you obtain automatically satisfies all the Streater-Wightman axioms and the Euclidean reconstruction theorem can be obtained with relative ease. However, it is not clear how gauge bundle structure actually affects the operator algebra, which makes gauge symmetry elusive; and the topology begins to intertwine with the algebraic geometry, which is a massive headache.These two approaches have been proven (Zhang-Baez) to be equivalent in free theories via the particle-wave duality theorem, however, but it is not clear how to bridge the two in terms of their pros can cons.

(I add: people have this idea that physicists are masters of making intuitive mathematical judgements. this is incorrect. they are masters of ignoring terms that makes analysis hard. they are masters of truncating taylor series and assuming everything is a harmonic oscillator)3) if you have two neurons to rub together, you can learn how to derive lagrangians in a day. but classical physics does not give you any tools to make qualitative judgements about the ridiculous ODEs you derive about these systems. unless, again, you make assumptions4) similar statement holds for continuum mechanics. if for some reason you are greedy and masochistic enough to work in numerical methods, than maybe learning a bit of continuum mechanics is a good idea. but in terms of theory, the low-hanging fruit has all been eaten and shat out a 100 years ago.

The notion of kernel makes sense in any category with a \"zero object\", meaning an object which is both initial and terminal. (For example, this makes no sense in the category of sets). Once you have a zero-object, between any two objects there is a unique morphism which factors through 0, which we call the zero morphism. You can use this to define kernels.There is one subtlety, and that's the fact that the kernel of a ring homomorphism (i.e. an ideal) is not necessarily a ring (by any gentleman's definition, since it doesn't contain 1), so kernels do not exist in the category of rings. They do exist in the category of modules over a ring though, which is one reason modules are nice.

This one looks like it could be ok, but don't follow any guide religiously. For example, Apostol is a questionable choice for an intro to calculus if you just want examples or the knowledge of how to \"do\" calculus like you would need for physics or something else.Books on proofs might be ok, but my preference (at least the way I learned things) is to pick a more beginner-friendly book on some other more specific topic like abstract algebra, so you can get to the point quicker, rather than proving \"obvious\" things for a while.Axler is a \"controversial\" choice for linear algebra, since he bends over backwards to avoid determinants. A popular \"conventional\" introductory book is Hoffman and Kunze. This could also function as a good \"first rigorous math\" book.Dummit and Foote is also a pretty thick book for a first course. Personally I have a hard time sticking to a book that long and daunting. This is good as a reference as you go into more specific subjects, but you might want something lighter to start off, so you can get a feel for what makes the subject interesting without getting burnt out. Honestly I'm surprised this guide wants you to read this and then Lang's Algebra, which seems very redundant.After that, keep in mind these things don't have a specific order. Linear algebra, abstract algebra, analysis, and point-set topology don't really have an order you need to follow. Each will get motivation and examples from the other, but in theory you can learn them in any order. (One exception: learning point-set topology without a first semester of analysis would be difficult, since most of the abstract ideas in topology are meant to generalize concrete things in analysis.)A last word of advice: I like short books: Sarancino's abstract algebra, Fulton's book on curves, Atiya & MacDonald's commie algebra, Serre's \"A course on arithmetic\", etc. ", " >>10098281>Dummit and Foote is also a pretty thick book for a first course.

", " If the Earth was flat and the Sun moved in a great circle around the N pole, you would see a difference from reality in motion most marked at times of rise and set. Place yourself on the equator during the equinox. At rise, the Sun would appear somehow and from north of the equator (left), with slow movement towards you (foreshortened) and southward (right, as it follows its circular path). Its horizontal motion diminishes over the course of the morning as its direction loses an X-component. As it reaches overhead (Noon) it would be moving most quickly and almost straight east-west. After Noon it would appear to slow down and begin its drift right (north), and farther along it loses the vertical movement (yet never set) while gaining the drift to the right and magically disappearing.That of course, is not what we see at the equator during an equinox. The Sun rises due east, transits straight up, and sets due west all at a constant angular speed all along its path, which is apparently straight up, over, and down, because in this geometry you (not a distant pole) are at the center of a circle it appears to trace.Continuing south during an equinox, a flat-Earther would still see the Sun appear from the NE, approach but curve left to due north at Noon, then continue left and away to the NW, fading away. In reality, the Sun still rises in the E, moves up and left to north at Noon, and then set again in the W. This motion (also traced by the stars at night) clearly shows there is an axis of rotation that rises up from the southern horizon and extending up and away south to a south celestial pole on the sky. A Sun (and stars) moving around a disk cannot behave like it is revolving around two poles (north and south) simultaneously. ", " >>10067316Furthermore, a close-proximity Sun would increase in brightness from invisible at \"rise\" to its brightest at Noon and back again to invisible at \"set\" in the course of one day. Light intensity varies by the square of the distance from the source. This means the intensity of the light from the Sun (and Moon, and stars) would continuously vary all day, and most radically just before and after Noon. Again we see differently, the Sun remains more or less constant in brightness during the day, with a good accounting (and weather-dependent) for its dimming when near the horizon due to atmospheric opacity.Lastly, if it were a \"close\" Sun and Moon passing overhead, there would be an obvious change in the apparent sizes of the objects as they approach, pass overhead, and head off again. Again, this is not what we see. The Sun and Moon stay the same angular size throughout their pass. You can experiment and prove this yourself by taking photos of them during rise, then again five or six hours later when they are at their highest, and maybe again as they set, just for added data. Measure their sizes in the photos. They're the same.And if you really want to gild the lily, get in communication with someone a thousand miles away. Use an astrolabe (you can make a crude-but-good-enough one using a school-grade protractor) to measure the altitude of the Sun (or Moon) simultaneously. You can easily triangulate the height of the object, and your result will show it's near infinity (you both have close to the same angle, due to the crudeness of the instrument). But if it were 6,000 miles up, you'd be able to reasonably measure the 10\u00b0 different viewing angle, or nearly 30\u00b0 if they were the 3,000 miles often quoted.

I admittedly could know my theorems and basic formulas a little better, but even when relying on cheat sheets for all that stuff I have a hard time determining WHAT exactly I have to do given the information I have in order to arrive at the required result.>Do you mean you understand each individual step but not why someone would use the technique or method in that particular wayI understand both of these things, but I lack the \"initiative\" to use those techniques myself, especially when the problem requires a little bit of creativity.And when I have to do something that requires a very straightforward method (like calculating a derivative to study monotony), I manage to fuck up on the calculations.Sorry for the longpost.

Second case is nothing happens, so the probability of extinction is just P again. Third case is now there are twice as many aliens, so a chance of P/2.

Not only is electric charge produced when mechanical stress is applied, but also mechanical stress appears when electric charge is applied.Mechanical stress, if applied in sufficient amount, is accompanied by mechanical strain, or deformation of the material under stress. In quartz crystal, strain appears as a bending of the crystalline structure when electric charge is applied across the plane of a crystalline sheet.An oscillator circuit composed of an amplifier and a resonator applies charge to the thin sheet of quartz crystal, and the crystal mechanically vibrates because of the reversible piezoelectric effect. The crystal acts as the resonator in the circuit. It vibrates at a desired frequency based on its thickness, shape, and the lattice plane from which the crystal is cut. The vibrating crystal acts as a filter which eliminates all electric signals with the exception of the desired frequency.The vibrating quartz crystal feeds back its frequency to the amplifier. As long as electric charge is continuously applied, and temperature does not vary too much, the mechanical vibrations of the crystal resonator are regular and dependable. ", " >>9807770So, tldr; since I'm sure you probably didn't catch most of that.A crystal 'vibrating at a frequency' is no more special than a tuning fork vibrating at a frequency when you hit it in terms of what is actually happening. It is just that the mechanism for 'hitting' the crystal is more complex and this makes it confusing to a lot of people.Crystals are no more magical or vibratory than a tuning fork, and can also be tuned like a tuning fork to vibrate at whatever frequency we desire. ", " I would add that electricity _can_ have an effect on the human body, in the form of electric shocks and/or burns.These effects are well understood, and no, they don't have any therapeutic benefits.Magnetic \"healing\" is also 100% bullshit.We put humans through MRI's all the time. You can't get within 10 feet of an active MRI without it ripping the car keys right out of your pocket, but the machine has NO effect on the human body.Remember folks: science gave us the technology to go to the moon, make robot surgeons, get (or send) live streaming porn form a device almost everyone has in their pocket and/or clone living animals.\"Alternative medicine\" has NEVER done anything but separate people from their money.

Same rules still pretty much apply in C.A. - can't divide by zero, exp(z)=/=0, etc. Thus, albeit with a few kinks and quirks, most properties from real calculus carry over.

Given the gene's prevalence, we'd predict a higher rate of diabetes than we actually find. This is because environmental causes effect the expression of the diabetes gene.

No, that's completely impossible.

This has been demonstrated very well by observing animals and even humans who receive damage to different parts of the brain, or really interesting cases like split-brain syndrome when the two hemispheres are almost entirely disconnected from each other. The simple fact is that if the brain decomposes, everything that you consider to be \"you\" is forever lost with it. There is nothing that could possibly retain your memories or continue your thoughts. You cannot become a ghost or communicate with the living.All that said, this is really just about the idea of a traditional \"afterlife\" in which \"you\" live on after death. The idea of some form of consciousness still existing is not out of the question, but it wouldn't really be you. Think something like those weird religions and philosophies about the oneness of the universe and all that - this kind of stuff is most definitely NOT ruled out in any way by science and never will be because they're untestable claims.

That's literally all you need to explain it in its entirety. I'm not kidding. We can run simulations of networks that only obey that one rule and they too will form associative memories and pattern recognition. We use those today for all sorts of AI tasks and by changing the topology and size of said network we can change how quickly and strongly these connections form to better suit them to our needs. What we don't understand is the actual structures in the brain that actually organize these memories, but we understand very well what those structures are made of and how their individual parts work.

But to put it another way: there's nothing in human behavior that cannot be explained by a brain with highly ordered structure and somewhere on the order of a quadrillion connections. Our simulations have proven that the type of network we observe within our brain is capable of storing memories that resemble the fuzziness of memories that we store.

A small linear network and a large dataset is sufficient for most practical uses, in the end you get out of them only what you put into them: they learn by association so you need to train them a lot to make them useful. If you just want to get started understanding the basics then nothing beats Python for fast prototyping:https://pythonprogramming.net/neural-networks-machine-learning-tutorial/But if you have a language you're more comfortable in there's innumerable resources out there and existing libraries to use or pick apart for just about all of them.On the other hand, if you are fascinated by the ways they can resemble natural intelligence, some kind of artifical life with neural nets that evolve from genes with good old natural selection can be interesting, but that has a lot of parts involved most of which don't even have to do with the net itself, like deciding how you'll balance resources and senses. The environment matters at least as much as the subjects there. For the network itself, implementing the NEAT method is essential so you can actually give proper control over the topology to the genes, because when it comes to brains, artificial or biological, the topology of the network is by far the dominating force in determining its behavior: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdfIf you want to do anything practical you'll be better off using an existing library, but it can be a fun and educational side project.

There was a strong conservative pushback. It became important to prove that blacks are subhuman to justify their disenfranchisement.See pic related, from the following metastudy:Jelte M. Wicherts, Conor V. Dolan, Han L.J. van der Maas, The dangers of unsystematic selection methods and the representativeness of 46 samples of African test-takers, Intelligence, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2010, Pages 30-37, ISSN 0160-2896, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2009.11.003>In light of all the available IQ data of over 37,000 African test-takers, only the use of unsystematic methods to exclude the vast majority of data could result in a mean IQ close to 70. On the basis of sound methods, the average IQ remains close to 80. Although this mean IQ is clearly lower than 100, we view it as unsurprising in light of the potential of the Flynn Effect in Africa (Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2010) and common psychometric problems associated with the use of western IQ tests among Africans.Read the whole thing if you want, it's pretty illuminating. Basically with Lynn, high IQ = unrepresentative, low IQ = representative. He even contradicted his own stated selection standards at times. Lynn had responded to other critiques of his studies, but he went silent after this one.(1/2) ", " >>9579599>But even if average sub-saharan IQ is 80, that's still really low, right? Ha!Yes, and no one is debating that. The average IQ (as in the measured value correlated with \"intelligence\") should be lower in underdeveloped, famine- and war-torn nations.The question is whether or not the difference is genetic in origin. i.e. \"if you took those blacks and raised generations of them in London, what would their IQ measure then?\"So Murray/Herrnstein's book \"The Bell Curve\" did some statistical wizardry using Lynn's base figure of 70 and arrived at a calculated mean of 85. And that's where those curves originate.Of course, if the more accurate correct base figure of 80 is used, the american black IQ might have come up to 95 or higher, which would contradict the agenda of the organization funding all of these studies, a single group called the Pioneer Fund. So if we have to take some IQ samples from hospital-bound malaria-afflicted children, so what?The Asian curve also used Lynn's studies as a base, including a body of studies that have also been debunked. Especially notable is a study that placed Japanese IQ at 111, later debunked by Japanese researchers who found it based on extremely biased samples. But the eugenicist and segregationist agenda desperately needed these results as well, to promote what they perceived as racial \"purity\".(2/2) ", " >>9579660Side note:It's interesting that the useful idiots of /pol/ can't countenance academic dishonesty when it comes to racial IQ studies, but accept it quite easily in regards to other issues such as climate change.

", " >>9539037Repeating my point from last thread (unfortunately I didn't have time to explain it in detail):So, OP, we come at last to the crux of the matter. There don't seem to be any serious technical mistakes with this proof (just a few minor ones that don't really affect anything); all that remains broken is your fundamental misunderstanding of the problem, which keeps the proof from working.>Because A is unordered [...] all deterministic Turing machines that decide the problem must compare [...] the sequence of 2^n elementsThis does not follow. What stops me from finding a clever shortcut by analyzing X, rather than analyzing PS(x) directly?It is true that if I write an algorithm that (1) computes PS(x), lazily or otherwise, and then (2) tries to scan PS(x) by in-order traversal, this will take \u03a9(2^n) time. But that does not apply to algorithms that try to work with X directly, and you have not proved that no such algorithm can exist.There are a few minor things wrong with your proof, but they are easily fixed. This is the big one. ", " >>9539037What does it mean to \"fold over the sum operation\"? Your clarification doesn't help whatsoever, you need to actually learn at least some naive set theory so you can make it clear what you're doing. It seems x is a finite set whose elements are natural numbers. You then introduce what I assume is the powerset of x, but it isn't at all clear how you are ordering Px, since its elements are not natural numbers but sets of natural numbers. If you're saying that we should produce a new set whose elements are natural numbers by summing the elements of the subsets of x, you should be aware that this set could be strictly smaller than Px, since different subsets of x can have the same sum.You're misusing the term \"well ordered\", which has a mathematical definition already -- you should talk about the order inherited from the naturals, but again this only applies to sets whose elements are all natural numbers.The XOR operation is typically defined for only 0 and 1, or \"true\" and \"false\", you haven't defined what you mean by the XOR of two general natural numbers, and I don't see what this has to do with ordering anything.You claim that ordering A (wasn't this x a moment ago?) \"invalidates the power key of PS(A)\", but you haven't proven that. Indeed, you haven't really defined what that means!You then finish by claiming that it is impossible to solve this problem in polynomial time, but aside from the fact that your problem isn't well defined as far as I can tell, you haven't proven this claim. You are assuming a solution must go through every element of this list and order it, but that might not be so. You don't know how a potential polynomial algorithm will work. For example, you could make similar claims about deciding whether a number is prime, because you have to go through and check if it's divisible by all smaller numbers, but primality testing CAN be done in polynomial time, just not by trial division.

I thought A was an input, and PS() was a well-specified algorithm. If PS(A) is an input, then that itself is already exponentially large, and the problem disappears.

You try to hide behind the fact that it's \"multiple keys\" and layering multiple functions and definitions, but essentially you're just performing one long complicated algorithm.. It doesn't matter if it's a series of keys, an algorithm, or sudoku puzzles it doesn't change the problem. You're just assuming some algorithm exists that always takes \u03a9(2^n) time to solve, and in doing so you're begging the question. If such an algorithm (or series of keys, or sudoku's, or whatever) exists, then you must first prove P = NP in the first place. In order to actually solve the problem at hand, you would have to find an actual algorithm and then rigorously test it and prove mathematically beyond a shadow of a doubt that NO other direct path to a solution exists. And if that sounds impossible, then congrats, you just found out why this has never been solved. ", " >>9539215here's another way to answer your question:the thing you have to show is that PS(A)[x xor KEY] is ordered. You question can be stated as \"Can you just examine A and KEY?\"No, you can't, because that's mathematically equivalent to sorting a set of 2^(|A|) size ", " >>9539215I'll definitely add a clarification for that point, if you just skim the paper it's easy to overlook some things that show that's not possible, so I'm not being clear maybe ", " >>9539265>the thing you have to show is that PS(A)[x xor KEY] is ordered. You question can be stated as \"Can you just examine A and KEY?\"Indeed it can.>because that's mathematically equivalent to sorting a set of 2^(|A|) sizeYes, so? The key point is that this is not an arbitrary list of 2^|A| elements -- it's a list *that I know to be generated by the PS() function*. Which means I know a great deal about the structure of PS(A); and if you know something about the structure of a piece of data, you can often avoid examining the whole thing. Just like you can search a sorted array in logarithmic time, by making use of your knowledge of the ordering-structure present in the data; likewise, I may be able to use the structure I know to be present in PS(A) to compute the problem you are after, in vastly less time than |PS(A)| = 2^|A|.I can mathematically search a sorted array A in O(log |A|) time, by making use of the structure I know to be in it. I claim that I can likewise solve the problem we are looking at here in O(log(|PS(A)|) = O(log(2^|A|)) = O(|A|) time, by making use of the structure I know to be in it generated by the PS() function. Your proof is not done until you can prove me wrong.(I don't actually claim to be able to do this, and I do think that P != NP. But proving me wrong on this IS the essential part of the P != NP problem.)>No, you can't, Prove it. ", " >>9539278If you're making this argument then my proof is not clear.

The problem is that you don't have anything to support this central point at all, in your proof OR in your head.

", " >>9539278also you can exploit the fact that the (x xor KEY) also is a special kind of sequence, not just any permutation of 1, 2, ... 2^|A| ", " >>9539037Okay, I'll go with the new thread if you insist on claiming the whole board with your proof attempt. First of all, assuming a fixed bound on the input size means you no longer are making a claim about P vs NP, as those are infinite classes of problems parameterized by the naturals (okay, thats not exactly true either, but you may assume this for your proof)My point about the keys remains unanswered: how do you guarantee that the keys are unique for every list of sets? If you don't, then first of all the name 'key' is confusing (keys refer to a unique value, it could be considered a hash otherwise). Second, why don't the keys have to be unique? Next, do you have a guarantee that the keys will be of polynomial size? If not, your problem doesn't even lie in NP!Also, it remains unclear to me what 1. is the input to your problem, PRECISELY and 2. What is its size? ", " >>9539305I wasn't going to complain about that part, because it's part of the easily fixed errors in the proof, and OP can fix that particular part by replacing his xor scheme by an arbitrary permutation input (you can specify one in O(n log n) bits, after all, meaning it doesn't significantly change the input length). But yes. ", " >>9539314I don't think you can specify an arbitrary permutation of the powerset in O(n log n) bits. ", " >>9539310Just to clarify, you stating that 'the key length is very tiny' doesn't answer my question at all. Prove it my man! ", " >>9539120holy fuck i fell on the ground laughing ", " >>9539310What OP is trying to get across is the following:- There is a function P(S) that for a set S generates the powerset of S in a particular specified order.- There is a function V(T) that for an element of P(S) computes a natural-valued value. V(T) = sum(T), but that's not really relevant.- There is a restricted class of permutations of P(S), let's call it X(S). This can express some particular permutations of P(S), details irrelevant; but the size of an element of X(S) is polynomial in |S|.- Consider the problem where you have an input S, and a permutation sigma in X(S). Problem: is the list [V(P(S)[sigma(i)]) for i in |P(S)|] non-sorted?- This problem is in NP (the is-sorted version is in co-NP), for a certificate can consist of elements i, j in [0, |P(S)|) such that V(P(S)[sigma(i)]) >= V(P(S)[sigma(j)]).- It also requires \u03a9(|P(S)|) = \u03a9(2^|S|) time to compute, because checking for sortedness of [V(P(S)[sigma(i)]) for i in |P(S)|] requires | [V(P(S)[sigma(i)]) for i in |P(S)|] | = \u03a9(2^|S|) time, and therefore so does checking nonsortedness in the worst case.- Thus the problem is in NP but not in P.Finding the central flaw is left as an exercise to the reader. ", " >>9539286not him, but your argument basically boils down to>here's this really hard thing to solve (NP)>it takes exponential time to solve normally but with keys we can prove a solution easily (P)that's the fucking easiest part. Anyone can do this, congratulations. There's thousands of NP- complete problems without a known solution that you're pretty sure is unsolvable. Nobody cares about that part. The problem here is this part:>therefore a turing machine with perfect information about all of the algorithms with all of the maths ever can't solve it I'm sorry but you can't just glance over this part. This is the very crux of the P = NP problem, the rest of this stuff isn't important at all. You are just assuming it can't solve it due to the complexity of your algorithm. But are you sure there are no short cuts? Yes, 99% sure whatever, but can you mathematically prove it? You are trivializing the most important part of the proof.No, it's not proving P=NP because the algorithms are really hard and your puny human mind can't come up with a way to solve them.

Environment. 10% of wilderness has vanished since 1992, and this will continue to decline. A lot of that is for animal agriculture. The greenhouse emissions of Veganism are also far lower, which is preferable, and the amount of hypoxic dead zones in the ocean is lower if everyone follows a vegan diet. Animal agriculture has also created a massive collapse in genetic diversity amongst species because we've replaced all the habitats with fields for cattle. 2. Overfishing. I can't eat fish. We are collapsing the oceans by fishing down the food web, taking the tops of the trophic chain away then continuing to overfish the stuff that is left for oil and fish farm food. Deep sea fishing is becoming a thing due to demand which targets very slow breeding deep sea fish that cannot sustain population when faced with our technologies. 3. Antibiotic resistance. This is primarily driven by animal farming on an industrial scale and is something that could quickly spiral out of control. This alone is enough of a reason to stop eating factory farmed meat at the very least. Fish farms have the same issueI am aware there are healthier diets but I'd rather take a couple of supplements than support the damage done by this industry.

This doesn't change the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, though, and the Amazon is an irreplaceable jewel so I don't want to risk funding the damages being done. I'm pretty sure that many of the grains grown there are exported to other countries for cattle feed anyway2. Farmed fish are almost always Salmon, Tuna etc, which are high trophic level fish and require fish feed, ie, they require the continued fishing of already exploited fisheries. These farms also contribute to dead zones because the fish shit so much into the narrow bands of water.

My girlfriend is a vegan and she's a normie so she browses facebook constantly and sometimes I'll just lay on her tits and see what she's seeing. The first time I did this I was fucking shocked because every 5 posts on her feed are either PETA propaganda showing animals getting slaughtered or capitalist propaganda trying to sell her food that is supposedly good for the environment and animals. (And for some reason, the capitalist propaganda always comes right after PETA's propaganda. So we know that facebook has some really fucking advanced emotional manipulation AI.)After seeing this a couple of times I confronted her about her veganism and she admitted that she really wishes to eat meat because it tastes so good. And she also hates veganism because stuff like vegan cheese costs 10 times what normal cheese costs and she isn't rich at all.That settled it for me. Veganism is a capitalist meme. Think about it. The food market is stale. The best and most efficient methods for producing food have been discovered long ago and are used by the biggest companies. So how does a new player actually compete in the market? By telling their customers that if they eat traditional food they are literally HITLER. Then, to pay for all this extra marketing (funding PETA) they raise the prices of their bullshit food. AND IT WORKS. I honestly consider my girlfriend to be a victim. This is psychological manipulation. This is emotional manipulation. Veganism and vegan propaganda should be outright illegal. PETA should be banned from all social media, and vegan food companies should be punished for this kind of punitive marketing.So my take is this. If you are a vegan, either you've been brainwashed by a corporation looking to make a quick buck, or you are one of them and you are a SICK FUCK.

Vegan propaganda will make you buy the latter.Also, I remembered something that adds to the Hitler thing. PETA published a video on facebook about how one of the methods of killing [some little animal, don't remember which one] was by putting them inside a gas chamber. And they were undercover interviewing the farmer and they asked them to show them. Then the farmer grabbed 5 of the little animals and put them in the gas chamber to fucking die.

The best diet is obviously one which is high in vitamins and nutrients as opposed to empty calories of fat/carbs. There is no debate on that, so meat/butter/sugar based diets are out of the question. A diet should be based on high antioxidant, vitamin+fiber rich whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. No one argues that these foods are very healthy and you should base your diet on them. All health authorities recommend this.The dispute is whether milk, meat, and fish should be included in the diet for health. I'll say a few things: There is no issue getting all vitamins, minerals, proteins, and essential fats on a vegan diet. Processed meat is a carcinogen [2] (Group 1, known, they are as sure it causes cancer as they are sure plutonium does), and red meat is a probable carcinogen.>Processed meat is defined as any meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or with the addition ofchemical preservatives; examples include bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs or processed deli or luncheonmeats.

So I can't really blame anyone for wanting to be vegan to spare the pain of animals, it's really whatever floats your boat.

If it's identical, even- let's say you ignore for the sake of the argument the structural and regulatory advancements that would be needed in our knowledge of how genetics works, and say we can implant the gene that controls for a cow rib superstructure, and all the necessary support genes, into a pumpkin plant, and can grow what would essentially be cow ribs (meat attached) on a plant. There would be, of course, no more \"\"pain\"\" than harvesting from a pumpkin plant, but it would be identical in composition to actual meat.At that point, would it be something vegans would dig?
