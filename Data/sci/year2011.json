", " >>4056601Nope.Hint: Nothing more than basic knowledge of how knight moves is needed to solve this riddle. You can use the knight's tour to prove the tactic used for lower dimension for higher dimensions but that's not the part of this riddle. ", " A knight can go to any square on the board given enough moves. So that if they worked together, the oddness, or evenness of the number of squares on the board would be the deciding factor. When you know this to be true, the objective for the 'due-to-lose' player becomes to make an odd number of squares on the board inaccessible to their opponent. The only way to make squares inaccessible to a player, is to make all the paths to those squares blue, without visiting the square. In the case of a board of any size, this would be most easily achieved by bluing-out the accessing squares of a single corner square, but there's no way to force your opponent to not just jump to the middle. I can't abstract this outward, but in the case of a 4X4 board, if ana places the piece at the edges, she'll win. you make th eopponent choose between corners at the start, and they never get back to it. ", " >>4056567Not true.

", " >>4056601You can't do this for a 4x4 board. It's not possible to get to each corner. ", " Hint: All three dimensions mentioned use similar tactic. This tactic also works for 4 x 4 board where the knight's journey is impossible. ", " >>4056638sorry, yes, I should have said, I'm drawing a rough search-tree and applying adversarial ai-algorithms. At least in a 4x4, if both players play their best moves, this will always be the case. I'm assuming that no limit-of-foresight applys in a 4x4 board. if ana thinks ahead and plays effectively, betty will never get a chance to 'fuck up' her moves -provided ana places her piece on the outside. in a 4x4 setting, the first move is critical. Note the difference in options for betty if the piece is placed on an edge(not a corner ) as opposed to in the middle. ", " >>4056666I like your idea but no, if Betty is smart enough, she can ALWAYS win 4 x 4 (provided Anna goes first). ", " This seems familiar, does the solution involve dividing the squares on board in groups of two? ", " >>4056690Yes it does! Do you know the answer? ", " For the 4x4 case, the first person to play a center square loses. Once someone plays the center, you follow up by going to a corner. Then they must take the only remaining square in the center. Followed by going into the opposite corner. And there are no more moves. ", " >>4056704Err, this works if it doesn't start in a corner. ", " >>4056695I'll try,for 4 x 4, you've got to divide the squares in groups of two, where both squares are mutually reachable. You're then left with 8 pairs. Anna moves first and puts the knight somewhere on board. Betty then moves the knight to the other square from the same group. This way, Betty will always have somewhere to go in her turns. Anna will eventually run out of squares to visit and loses.The same tactic is used for 6 x 6.For 5 x 5, it's a little different. Again, the squares are divided in groups of two where both squares are mutually reachable. One square is left unmarked now, and that's where Anna puts the knight. Betty then moves the knight anywhere she wants to. Anna will then keep moving the knight on the second square from the same group. Betty will then eventually run out of places to go and loses.Comprehensible enough? ", " >>4056704This would work if Anna cooperated and put the knight in one of the four corners.

Do you somehow know the riddle or are you just smart? ", " >>4056716How exactly do you divide the squares? I'm not sure what you mean by mutually reachable. ", " >>4056737And if Anna starts in a corner, then Betty will move to the center. Anna can either move to the edges, and then it will be like starting on an edge and lose.

", " >>4056761Mutually reachable means being able to jump with knight from one square to the other one in the same group. One such possibility ", " >>4056778Ahh I see.

Concurrently, the Plasma Membrane Redox System allows the cell to turn its NADH back into NAD+ by dumping electrons outside, where they tend to interact with low-density lipoproteins and propagate throughout the organism. The cell basically sustains itself at the expense of its surroundings.Please note that these mutations are comparatively rare and don't tend to appear in any significant proportion in young people. Only certain specific mutations - those that quickly and completely knock out oxphos - can cause clonal expansion. Other types of mutations are either fixed by mitochondrial glycosylases and pol gamma or lead to membrane damage that causes destruction of the entire organelle.

Mitochondria like everything originated in unicellular organisms that were obviously not human ", " >>4021564The mutation rate of mtDNA is actually significantly higher (60x) than nDNA due to lack of histones, poor repair capacity, and proximity to the electron transport chain (the main source of ROS in the body). The most common mutation is the incorporation of 8-oxo-dG into the genome, which tends to mispair with adenosine, likely leading to a 'leakier' electron transport chain and the 'slipping' of more superoxide molecules. These ROS tend to cause membrane damage, which results in the destruction of the mutant mitochondria. Therefore, it's only the mutations that I previously described that are relevant in this case, especially since any mitochondrion with a functional ETC engages in fusion and pools its proteins with other mitochondria.I've read nothing in the literature about why mitochondria cannot ever leave the origin cell, but my best guess is as follows:Many mitochondrial proteins (and assemblers) are coded for by the nuclear DNA at this point in time, including enzymes necessary for the glycolysis that sustain the clonal-expansion-prone mutant mitochondria. As such, destroying the host cell would very quickly put an end to the mitochondria (which are already operating far below normal capacity), ensuring that no such proliferation is possible.

At that point it isn't anything at all, it just becomes another drug.It's fun, but I don't know if I'd ever do it again. The whole feeling is one of your brain spasming under the weight of all these bizarre reactions. You just fry, your world gets turned inside out and you start seeing things in these odd ways. I've done it only 4 or 5 times I think. The last two times (years ago) I felt as if I had complete control over it, like it wasn't anything at all. I knew what to expect, and as soon as it came I knew how to deal with it to the extent that it almost felt like being drunk, like you can handle it if you've been drunk before.In that sense it seems like the effects are overblown by hippies and psychonauts who think it is the key to understanding or something. It's just a drug, one that sends all of your senses for a loop and balloons your conciousness to this more objective perspective.

", " >>3932536Holy shit, imagining all these things makes it a little more interesting, awesome, thanks ", " >>3932553It's just a guess. I'm also uncertain if there is any oxygen at all in the fuel compartment of a normal lighter. It seems like that shouldn't be allowed for this exact reason. It's still possible that some managed to get in there and build up over time until a spark managed to get down in there and set it aflame, but this is just one possible explanation.Another example is that the metal bit may have been hot from keeping a flame for a period (you may have noticed this happen sometimes). Then when you put it under the pringles can for whatever reason it insulated the lighter which allowed for the heat to not dissipate to the atmosphere, but rather to the plastic portion containing the pressurized fuel. Since the fuel is already under pressure to stay as a liquid (not a huge amount of pressure, but still some), it is fairly sensitive to heating, because relatively little heat would be required to make it go back to the gas phase if it wasn't under a large amount of pressure. Since gasses are less compact than liquids, the increasing pressure of the vapor over the liquid would cause the already elevated pressure to increase, and the plastic can only take so much. The explosion may have come about in this way, and then residual heat in the insulated area under the can, as well as the heat generated from expanding the gas under a constant volume before the lighter exploded, could have given the butane enough energy to light on fire and melt the plastic. Like I said, there are a lot of variables and it's hard to say without having been there.

Because if so that's probably the cause of the explosion.The lighter was probably very hot after you used it and putting a pringlecan ontop of it would prevent the heat from getting out so the heat instead spread all over the light and the heat combined with the weight of the can made the lighter break, then the heat ignited the fuel.

Logical thinking requires energy. You should go for a walk, maybe you'd actually burn some. ", " By the early 1970s, as the costs of the Vietnam War and increased domestic spending accelerated inflation,[1] the U.S. was running a balance-of-payments deficit and a trade deficit, the first in the 20th century. The year 1970 was the crucial turning point, because foreign arbitrage of the U.S. dollar caused governmental gold coverage of the paper dollar to decline from 55% to 22%. That, in the view of neoclassical economics and the Austrian School, represented the point where holders of the U.S. dollar lost faith in the U.S. government's ability to cut its budget and trade deficits.By 1971, the money supply had increased by 10%.[1] In the first six months of 1971, $22 billion in assets left the U.S.[2] In May 1971, inflation-wary West Germany was the first member country to unilaterally leave the Bretton Woods system \u2014 unwilling to devalue the Deutsche Mark in order to prop up the dollar.[1] In the next three months, West Germany's move strengthened their economy. Simultaneously, the dollar dropped 7.5% against the Deutsche Mark.[1] ", " >>3853202Due to the excess printed dollars, and the negative U.S. trade balance, other nations began demanding fulfillment of America's \"promise to pay\" \u2013 that is, the redemption of their dollars for gold. Switzerland redeemed $50 million of paper for gold in July.[1] France, in particular, repeatedly made aggressive demands, and acquired $191 million in gold, further depleting the gold reserves of the U.S.[1] On August 5, 1971, Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar, in an effort to protect the dollar against foreign price-gougers.[1] Still, on August 9, 1971, as the dollar dropped in value against European currencies, Switzerland unilaterally withdrew the Swiss franc from the Bretton Woods system.[1][edit] The ShockTo stabilize the economy and combat the 1970 inflation rate of 5.84%,[3] on August 15, 1971, President Nixon imposed a 90-day wage and price freeze, a 10 percent import surcharge, and, most importantly, \"closed the gold window\", ending convertibility between US dollars and gold. The President and fifteen advisers made that decision without consulting the members of the international monetary system, so the international community informally named it the Nixon shock. Given the importance of the announcement \u2014 and its impact upon foreign currencies \u2014 presidential advisers recalled that they spent more time deciding when to publicly announce the controversial plan than they spent creating the plan.[4] Nixon was advised that the practical decision was to make an announcement before the stock markets opened on Monday (and just when Asian markets also were opening trading for the day). On August 15, 1971, that speech and the price-control plans proved very popular and raised the public's spirit. The President was credited with finally rescuing the American public from price-gougers, and from a foreign-caused exchange crisis.[4][5] ", " >>3853202By December 1971, the import surcharge was dropped, as part of a general revaluation of the major currencies, which thereafter were allowed 2.25% devaluations from the agreed exchange rate. By March 1976, the world\u2019s major currencies were floating \u2014 in other words, the currency exchange rates no longer were governments' principal means of administering monetary policy.

You have created an artificial situation that does not reflect reality. THe manufacturing emissions of an EV are not many orders of magnitude greater than a regular car. The emissions involved in making the first generation prius were higher, because it used nickel metal hydride batteries which require smelting, an emissions heavy process. This is where the commonly shared meme that \"Hybrids pollute more than gas vehicles\" came from. Modern EVs use lithium batteries. Lithium carbonate is a nontoxic mineral salt that, when refined into lithium metal, is among the softer, stickier metals known. For this reason it can be extruded in a process that need not use fossil fuels as the equipment involved is hydraulic, driven by electrical pumps. Even when it is powered from the grid it remains vastly, vastly less polluting than smelting and the end result is a vehicle with less in the way of manufacturing emissions than a gas auto.

Refer to this study: http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_wtw.pdfThe gist is that because an electric motor is 85% efficient at turning electricity into forward motion versus 15-25% for internal combustion engines (which waste most of the energy in gas as heat or transmission friction) and because charging a lithium battery is around 99% efficient, and average loss in transmission from the power plant to your house is 6.5%, and large scale powerplants are more efficient and do a better job of reducing emissions than automobile engines, the end result is that even when charged from today's grid (which is 45% coal, not 100%, and 30% of it is nuclear + renewables) it's still twice as clean as a gas vehicle under the worst conditions.

Then, a good time to sell is when you think the stock is about to crash, or just as the stock begins to crash and at a point higher than what you bought for. Don't worry about not making as much money as you could, you still made money. Additionally, if you're going to lose money, its better you lose it, than to sit on the stock hoping it goes back up. Your investment will almost never *completely* disappear, so even if you lose, you can still take that money and invest it into another stock immediately, rather than sitting and hoping and praying and waiting for the stock that crashed to stop crashing and rise in price.You also want to look for price points that the market does not like to pass through. For example, a stock may continually spike as high as $10, but never go higher than this for very long, so you would know that if this stock were to spike to about $10 that you should probably sell (self fulfilling prophecy, perhaps).Also, rule of thumb, don't invest more than about 3% of the money you have available in a single stock.

The financial markets exhibit significant Brownian motion, making it impossible to select stocks, bonds, mutuals, or other financial devices that will perform exponentially well in the very short term. As a trained economist I have enough sense to know that quantitative finance is bullshit and economics isn't much better.Thirdly, taxes on short-term capital gains are very high, meaning that a short-term market player loses significantly. The tax accounting (and accounting in general) of day-trades is insufferably complex, meaning that any competent day trader (the few that there are) must employ an accounting assistant.

As someone else said earlier, I believe, it could be a metaphor more for the introduction of evil into the world that for the creation of the world/universe itself.Secondly, simply because old-skool Christians/Jews believed that Genesis was a literal account does not mean that it is. Again, the most probable situation would seem to be that in which those who were born closer to the time of writing of Genesis possessed a better understanding, but that is not necessarily the case at all. You are, essentially, saying that \"old Christians believed this, and therefore this is your argument.\" I suppose it is a straw man, in a way. Anyway, if scripture is indeed \"divinely inspired\" (by a necessarily transcendent being) then what makes you think that even those close to the time of writing would understand it's meaning? Even the author(s)?Thirdly, I believe using the definition of the Hebrew for \"day\" as an indefinite period of time is used more for Christians who are not YECs interpreting Genesis literally.

In Teutonic cultures it was a flat disc encircled by a massive snake and suspended in the branches of the world tree, Yggdrasil.

The largest lofstrom loops possible with current engineering can lift 500 million tons a year and since you could only fit about 1000 on earth it would take nearly 10 million years to disassemble the planet. But it can be done only with proven technology, no super materials or new energy sources needed. You could power them using huge convection towers that contain liquid halite, which would be heated by the hot lithosphere you are uncovering. And of course the job would only get easier as the planet is taken apart: less gravity, more heat being radiated, more materials for building and maintaining the loops. That said you still have to use nuclear pulse propulsion to move the material for the first loop into orbit, about 2 million tons of it. But with nuclear pulse propulsion that is doable. Then we arrange all that matter in a dyson sphere. Then we use nuclear pulse propulsion to go to other stellar systems and repeat ad infinitum.

And worst of all, the humans and aliens cannot even fight properly given their ships' capabilities.The humans should have just introduced argon into their engine. When the antimatter annihilates that argon the energy released would excite the remaining argon and it would release lots of photos. So the argon could act as a lasing medium. 1g of antimatter should give you about 3.5 seconds of 1 terawatt laser power. Since each second the laser emits 239 tons of TNT. That would fuck up the starfish something good. Or they could have just collated the engine exhaust more and used it as big fuckin particle gun. Idiots.The aliens used a plasma torus, fucking retards! Plasma loses energy as it emits photons, in the two second it took to reach the human ship it would have bled off 75% of it's mass even if it wasn't fusing. Also instead of using all the electricity they needed to make that plasma, contain it in a magnetic bottle, and project that bottle, they could have just made couple of rail guns from any ferrous material they had lying around or even the superconductive carbon materials they had and used their XBOXHUGE magnetic field. And it would hit the human ship with five time the kinetic energy the torus did for the same amount of electricity used. And it would not have created the fuckton of waste heat the making that torus would have and therefore not given away the fact that they were going to shoot.For all their \"genius\" the vampire and aliens are tactically retarded.

Does a general know how to use every weapon in his army? Does he know how to traverse every artillery piece? No, his job is long term strategy. He is the last to know about events in the field and occasionally his orders are rendered irrelevant by a divisional commander acting on new information he just recieved. Sapience is for long term strategy. I you study karate and program you muscle memory to let you fight more efficiency using that style, it is the muscle memory doing a lot of it. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the sapience was what decided those would be useful traits to acquire. When we start taking about organisms that can modify themselves genetically or mechanically it becomes even more of an advantage for the same reason. Long term planning and assessment of the viability of the organism as a whole. And I don't even see how you can divide the mind up like that anyway, sapience is a process not a single program. It occurs what the frontal lobes link to any other part of the brain and fire in tandem. It's not really something that can be separated out, at least if it acts the way we think it does. And if we start getting into organisms that can self modify then the ability to self assess becomes very useful. And if you started strapping on extra synthetic neurology(CPUs in a backpack) and slowly letting your central nervous system integrate with them over decades you would end up with something which is smarter than the vampires and still able to self assess, while at the same time the percentage of the neurology used for that sense of self is reduced since you never really need more of that function.

They have to take of over stellar systems so that they can prevent the spread of alien probes, prepare the way for human colonists, and be ready with stockpiles of rkvs to fire at communicative civilizations as soon as they are discovered. Berserkers are only really useful long after they are deployed, since their job is to check the advance of other intelligent life. Ultimately we might just want to hit every single planet with liquid water on it with an rkv just be sure, it's not like we'll need a biosphere at that point anyway.Part of the problem I had with Watts thing was that the aliens lived in an energy poor environment compared that around a star. Which indicates that they are either to stupid to understand that more energy=more reproduction, or they were driven into that environment by something else that does specialize in energy rich environments. But then why didn't that energy rich species make the same antimatter propelled ship the humans us and colonize the galaxy already.Rather than resolve the fermi paradox in the book, Watts makes it worse.Unless the starfish are a benign Barcell probe sent by a species that is too stupid to try to kill all other intelligent life.

That way you are ripping them apart with extensional force rather than trying to burn through or shear them apart, which they are resistant to. Now that we are that close just tighten the magnetic cage that collates our engine exhaust. The exhaust from a antimatter engine should give off a fairly well collated plume of protons stripped from whatever reaction mass they are using to provide thrust by being heated by the hydrogen/antihydrogen reaction. And the plume would be 50,000 miles long to several million miles long depending on how well it was collated. The plume of Theseus's admittedly under powered engine as described in the book will release the force of several megatons/second when it hits the target. The reason you wait so late is that the damn thing's magnetic field could disrupt the exhaust cone quite badly, but at under 20,000km it will not have enough of an effect to prevent significant damage. And as a bonus you can have the drones fire their little pea shooter perpendicular to the ship as you come in, giving the Rorshach object the equivalent of a relativistic hail storm. But only do that will the photon drive/laser is firing the deceleration from the normal reaction engine would likely shake the drones off the ship, and unless they could make enough of a course correction to hit the alien object they would be wasted.

The peak oil graph you guys use alot on your sites is on the Hubbard Decline Curve. However this only counts proved recoverable reserves rather than known recoverable reserves. Proved means that you have 4 wells within the drainage radius of the proposed well site, which ensures that you will hit oil. Putting this way, proved reserves are for areas with active drilling, while known reserves are estimates based on geology but in sections of oil fields without enough active drilling to prove the reserve exists. I always used the lower estimates though, so the number should be as conservative as the current data allows. Hubbard Decline Curve is also optimized to predict decline of oil production from Texas limestones, in fields where all data is available(Texas law states that all companies have to give their well logs and production reports to the state and that they must be accurate), and that there are outside markets that cause diminishing returns from marginally producing wells. This was an excellent graph that tracked the production of Texan oil very well. However a graph showing the worlds production of petroleum as it is exhausted would be a descending plateau rather than a peak, since there is no outside source of oil to make the marginally producing wells undesirable. So instead of a 150 year slow decline from a peak, you get a 75 year slowly rising plateau and a steep drop off at the end.

However I must warn you that Cohen is the Edison/Tesla of nuclear power, he is a shameless self-promoter, although with good reason. He often words his sentences to play up is inventions, note that every statement is factual but worded in a way that may be misleading to those unfamiliar with nuclear reactors. Example: Cohen would state that there is a 5 billion year supply of fissionable uranium assuming that all the U238 in the lithosphere was recovered and used in breeder reactors. However given estimated recoverable U238 reserves, an increase in electrical consumption of 10% compounded yearly, and the halflife of U238 there is only a 23,000 year supply. Of course even that assumes that all the 10% yearly increase will come from nuclear energy. But remember that that 10% increase in consumption compounded annually can quickly outstrip the the demand of 200 billion people with the current demand of a US citizen. Hence why his numbers indicate a 23,000 year supply rather than a 30,000 year one. ", " >>3074331I read them, they were okay.

These replicas would then be sent out to other star systems. The original \"parent\" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, \"Lungfish\" (see Examples in fiction below), David Brin touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a Darwinistic fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions.

Then when you have your value for r, sub it into the original volume equation to get your volume.For the last part, you can prove whether a point is a maximum or minimum by taking the second derivative: d^2V / dr^2Then when you have the second derivative, sub in the value you got for r earlier on, and if it's comes out negative: it's a maximum and if it comes out positive it's a minimum.Most people tend to find the first part of the question the hardest, but it's not so bad once you get the hang of it.

An example of such an experiment is placing a single unstable atom in a controlled environment; it cannot be predicted how long it will take for the atom to decay; only the probability of decay within a given time can be calculated. Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities. ", " >>2930707undefined means that it can be defined. This is a non-achieved state of a particular knowledge.Hard or impossible (for now) to define (therefore, to predict) is not \"random\". Even Q states are not random, just undefined, unexplained.Nothing can be randolm, as the single faintest shadow of a property in an object will affect the outcome of its reactions and states, so, it can be predicted. No randomness, no perfect objects etc. These are the limits of our current mathematical models and ideas on how the universe works.

According to that principle, you have a ball at the top of a hill that starts rolling down after a completely arbitrary amount of time.Of course, Newton also has a law that says that something can't start moving without a force applied to it, so it's a paradox... or else the principle that Newtonian mechanics is reversible in time is flawed.

For example, the Bohr atom consists of a bunch of marbles, but the Bohr model only predicts some energy levels in the shell and such.>Because this is the easiest representation of the model to us?Yes. Building models is all about what you want to describe with it. For example, QM describes your car completely, but it would be a pretty inefficient idea to calculate whether its door is open by doing QM. Instead, you could look at the door. Similarly, if you're just looking for the main energy transitions of hydrogen, the Bohr model is good enough. However, when you start looking closer, you'll notice that your lines aren't single lines but packs of smaller ones. In order to understand these, you'll need to break l degeneration, which is QM. (If you keep looking, QM will fail and you'll need quantum field theory.)>I guess, the question is; though measurable and able to be modelled, is it our human limitation that prevents a more faithful model from being constructed?See above. You only need to model so far as you want to have predictions.There are no EM waves in our life. There's light, i.e. the impression of brightness. To make reasinable predictions, you start modeling light as straight lines with a color and speed. You can now understand refraction and such, everything's fine.

Furthermore, several studies show a significant decrease of cancer death rates in areas with high backgrounds. It can be concluded that prolonged exposure to high levels of natural radiation possibly triggers processes such as the production of antioxidants and repair enzymes, which decreases the frequency of chromosome aberrations and the cancer incidence rate.\"\"Inhabitants of Ramsar, a city in northern Iran, are exposed to levels of natural radiation as high as 55\u2013200 times higher than the average global dose rate. Furthermore, radon levels in some regions of Ramsar are up to 3700 Bq m?3. To assess the association between the radon concentration and frequency of lung cancer, lung cancer patients recorded over the past 2 years in eight districts of Ramsar with different levels of radon were studied. Data from the Ramsar Health Network show that both crude lung cancer rate and adjusted lung cancer rate in one district with the highest recorded levels of external radiation and radon concentration are lower than those of the other seven districts.

The fuel is not more available, it isn't actually cleaner, and it doesn't pose any less risk of making nuclear weapons more available.

While our remote vertebrate ancestors possessed tetrachromacy, our nocturnal, warm-blooded, mammalian ancestors lost two of four cones in the retina at the time of dinosaurs. Most teleost fish, reptiles and birds are therefore tetrachromatic while all mammals, with the exception of some primates and marsupials, are strictly dichromats.Primates achieve trichromacy through color photoreceptors (cone cells), with spectral peaks in the violet (short wave, S), green (middle wave, M), and yellow-green (long wave, L) wavelengths. Not all primates, however, are capable of trichromacy. The catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes) are routine trichromats, meaning both males and females possess three opsins (pigments) sensitive to 430 nm, 530 nm, and 560 nm wavelengths. In contrast, with the exception of Alouatta and Aotus, all platyrrhines (New World monkeys) are allelic or polymorphic trichromats.\"\"These two conflicting forces (homogenization and polymorphism) suggest that a balancing selection for trichromacy is present in the form of heterozygote advantage. Diurnal primates generally eat fruits and young leaves, and it has been argued that trichromatic color vision is an adaptation for folivory and frugivory. Trichromacy is observed in nearly all New World primates, and can offer a selective advantage in the discrimination for the most nutritive, colorful items; behavioral studies have shown that trichromats are 50% more likely to detect fruits compared to dichromats. However, in dim light, trichromats have exhibited a slight disadvantage for discriminating fruit from foliage. Since almost all New World monkeys are known to search for food cooperatively, the entire group can benefit from the advantages of trichromacy and dichromacy.\"Read more: Why humans cannot see colors that fall in the ultraviolet or infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum ", " Seriously though, if certain animals can hear sounds too high to too low for us to hear could the same not apply to light aswell?

Some species, like horses, give birth to fully developed infants and as a result their offspring can take care of themselves within minutes or hours after birth. On the opposite end would be animals like marsupials which technically give birth to an embryo (although it then develops inside the pouch). Inbetween you've got animals like mice and rats which give birth to offspring late in the fetal period (which is why rat pups are bald, blind, and completely incapable of doing anything other than twitching) and humans which give birth right on the border of the fetal and infant periods. As a result, human newborns are still pretty helpless because they haven't actually finished developing yet. Reason for that being that humans' heads make birth extremely difficult for the mother. If humans were to wait any longer to give birth pretty much every birth would end in death because the baby's head would be too big to fit through the birth canal.Also, thanks much in part to our huge brains, humans develop very slowly. There are a few other animals that develop slowly as well, like elephants.

", " The criteria for getting into a good grad school really depends on the field. That said, I can give you some concrete advice on grad programs in Math, since that's what I did for my graduate studies. Some of it will likely apply to other fields.Obvious fact #1: A good grad school is harder to get into than a mediocre one. If you're looking to get into a top 10 grad school it helps if you were in a top 10 school for undergrad. There's some leeway but you'll have to impress the admissions people another way if you went to a B-tier school.Top-tier schools have top-tier professors, and top-tier professors do research. In fact, it's often their primary focus. Teaching is just a side thing for a lot of them. These professors will be interested in what research you did as an undergraduate. Make sure you do at least one research project during your undergrad career. Not only will it help you get in to grad school, it will let you find out if the work interests you.Letters of reference are really important. We like to think academia is a meritocracy, but the truth is that you're more likely to get a good recommendation if your professors like you. Make an effort to get to know them. If you do undergrad research the professors will likely be able to give you a good recommendation.GRE scores (like the SAT, but for grad school) can keep you out of a good program but they won't get you in. That means they expect you to ace it, and if you don't it will raise some questions. Just aceing the exam isn't enough, though. References and research are weighted far more heavily.For math, getting a perfect score on the Putnam exam guarantees you entrance to any grad program in Mathematics. That said, the median score is 2 out of 150.

The vast majority of actual real world monopolies are not \"necessitated\" by economies of scale but instead have been politically conferred by government at the instigation of formerly dominant firms grown fearful of emerging competition.Where natural monopoly situations do exist, they tend to be of comparatively short duration, since advances in technology quite regularly seem to create opportunities for new competitors to undercut established giants of the industry.Even where natural monopoly situations exist for prolonged periods, high elasticity of demand due to the availability of substitute goods very often means that \"monopolistic\" levels of price and output turn out to differ very little from the theoretical competitive optimum.Even where natural monopolies exist for prolonged periods and potentially would cause sizeable divergences from socially optimum levels of price and output, there is very little reason in theory or in historical experience to expect that real world regulatory agencies will in fact bring output and prices any closer to the theoretical optimum, because regulatory policies in practice are almost always much more responsive to arbitrary political pressures (especially from the regulated industry itself) than to any burning desire to have price equal marginal cost.Moreover, financing the regulatory agency's large and highly paid staff (as well as the payroll for the regulated firms' expanded legal department and lobbying organization) is itself a sizable social cost imposed by the regulatory process that often outweighs any social benefits achieved.\"- Dr. Paul M.

For example, having a larger V1 region would mean you would retain finer visual features better, while having a larger prefrontal cortex would mean being able to remember more details and having more complex associations/memories in general. Humans are very fortunate because of our vocal chords and enlarged prefrontal cortex which allowed us to eventually develop a language. Our environment and how \"generic\" our body is (hands/etc) allowed us to gather a lot more knowledge about the world than most animals can. Once we gained the ability to share and store knowledge and pass it to our children, we as a race began evolving (not in the sense of genetic evolution) much faster, at least as far as knowledge is concerned.For example elephants have fairly large brains, but their body is highly unsuited for development of high-level intelligence like ours.As for the topic at hand, I think the case of blacks having lower IQs is mostly educational, but genetic probably plays a small role as well. Even if someone's neocortex is slightly smaller in some regard, they can still compensate for it, as long as the WILL to learn is there.
