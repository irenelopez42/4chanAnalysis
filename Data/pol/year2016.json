So, many public schools were originally funded with the purpose of making workers for the industrial economy; you can see still see relics of this all over such as school bells.\n\nWhat you have now is roughly the byproduct of the cold war, the great depression, and a la mode politics of the day. Industry is much less involved in the curriculum of schools directly as the majority of work can be done by someone with a middle school education, but the great depression forced students to attend for a greater period as to take them out of the competitive workforce. Nationalism in the US was fed in the cold war to garner public support for vague American principles.\n\nCommon taste is really more of what you're talking about. It's not so much of a top down deal, though. Schools are modestly competitive to other schools thus they want to showcase how they're improving and utilizing their budgets for \"modern\" projects. Thus you get bullshit classes that might be completely useless, but sound fancy. Likewise, books reflect the taste of the era as they have to be sellable to these schools. Then you have local school boards who have elected positions who have to cater to whatever is considered the fashion of the day.\n\nThus, you eventually just end up with a school system that sells modern values to students because it allows teachers to justify their spending, sells books, and otherwise just keeps them in work.", ">>99541350\n\nsee\n\n>>99542274\n\nDo you think Steve Wozniak went to school to build the first Apple computer?\n\nHow many pioneers of software or IT specialists making their own million dollar companies actually went to school for it?\n\nI'll give you a tip: pretty much none of them.\n\nI know you faggots want to think that your time spent in class wasn't a waste of time and money but it was and your inability to compete with people who have true initiative that learned with books and practice will stare you in the face for the rest of your life.", ">>99542660\nThis should be massively changed somehow.

The internet continually subverts, and the efforts of those who subverts must be continually subversive. \n\nNo, it can only be shut down and censored, which I believe is the inevitable outcome. Without the internet, there simply is no Donald Trump - there is no 4chan, there is no reddit, etc. Any threats to the establishment can be removed.\n\nThe censorship will come indirectly. Large companies will purchase and own massive content aggregators and servers, which will create an internet sandbox for the average netizen. This has already happened and will continue to happen. Though there will be much more freedom overall, the main narratives can still be controlled.", "Assange has undeniable proof that the Holocaust is a hoax.", ">>91447712\nI agree in spirit, but in practice I think the idea of a deep state is too nebulous and too frightening to ever take hold.

It's simply in the interest of the deep state to keep things running for normal people. They will eventually fail at that, but in the meantime we have it pretty good.

That's just for starters. Ask about his mind control sometime. \n\nAnyway, here is the story of Donald Trump's quest to save Hillary Clinton from her twin demons: Bill and Crooked. Some parts get a little twisty but don't worry, it's dank.\n\nHillary Rodham started life as a well adjusted young girl, bright and adorable. She was the smile on your grandpas face and the red in a schoolboys cheek. Life was an amazing adventure, full of laughter and fear and striving and loving and losing and wishing and hoping and yearning! This was a girl who knew no danger, knew no limit, knew no obstacle she could not overcome.\n\nAnd she grew up to be a good little Goldwater girl. Old America, red white and blue. A wonderful life awaited!\n\nBut she met Bill.\n\nBill was a cunt. The most charming guy you'll ever meet, but his biology gave him the ability to lie without feeling bad \u2013 an ability our bright eyed girl from the Midwest had no defense for. Bill looked at her and said \u2013 lying, with sincerity! - that the rumors about him were all untrue and he was a good man and he'll be true and you'll never regret it...\n\nBill was a cunt. He lied well enough that our girl followed him lovingly and hopefully to meet her second demon.\n\nCrooked came so easily onto our girl that it should scare all of us. Bill's lies couldn't hold up forever, Hillary was far, far too smart for that. But the idea Bill is a demon....? No. He is a good man.\n\nThe first lie. Crooked dug its talons deep with the first lie."}, "replies": ["Uppity sluts claiming to the media that Bill had not been a good man were threatening his campaign for governor, and our Hillary stood in righteous defense of Bill, who was a good man. Crooked whispered that they were lying...the stories arent't true...Bill Is A Good Man. \n\nWith this, Hillary died. Crooked sank her talons in deep, and a bright eyed, happy child became Crooked Hillary. Such a monumental tragdy \u2013 an innocent lost to a demon she could not hope to outmatch! - reverberated through time and space and reached the ears of one Donald J. Trump, a humble wall merchant among the time-traveling large genitalia having future culture of blonde bawdy bosses. He heard her cry.\n\nAcross time and space...Don heard his girl cry for the first time. As Crooked pulled out her heart, his keen senses and boundless compassion created a bond unique in the universe between himself and the girl that could have been. The universe would never know what was lost. Don shook his head as tears rolled down his strong jaw. He would never have his girl.\n\nBut then he remembered he was a time traveler with a massive dong so he sent himself back in time to be born as a humble real estate developer's son in New York.\n\nNow some may take this opportunity in the narrative to flesh out details, have several minor and major plots, make you really feel for the characters involved. Some may.", "We all know the story up until now. How Bill and Crooked \u2013 the lying, so much lying, why won't it stop he makes me please why does he make me lie! - tore our little girl Hillary to pieces and left her corpse to be a puppet of the echoey interests.\n\nAll of this Don watched from afar, weeping every night because of what was being done to his true love. He would never feel truly at home with anyone but Hillary \u2013 his beautiful Hillary! - and Don's list of loves lost grew every year because of it. Empress Melania knew of his deep devotion to Hillary and loved him all the more for it because of the beauty and esoteric nature of such a transdimensional commitment. Melania loved the Don that would die for Hillary \u2013 and he was man enough for both of them, she well knew. She smiled, thinking about the three of them together one day. He could love and provide for two women easily \u2013 for he was not a cuck.\n\nOn the Labor Day before the election, Don saw something that chilled him to the bone. His girl \u2013 our girl, Hillary! His girl was coughing on national television. She was coughing and hacking and having a stroke it seemed, but no, just a cough. Her voice returned, low energy at first, but it was there. That sweet, sweet voice he first heard years ago crying as it was silenced by Bill and Crooked.\n\nIt would soon be time to slay Crooked and begin saving his girl.\n\nThe first debate started like any other \u2013 standard introductions, claps, fake smiles, all the pageantry of an alleged democracy. When Don reached out to clasp Hillary's hand - his girl! no, Crooked still...- he felt the whisper of an echo of the memory of what some weaker men would call nervous for the first time in his impeccable life. Her hand felt as he hoped it would.\n\nIt felt better. It felt like home. He had a chance at his girl and he seized it.", ">Why are you so full of bullshit, hillary?\n\ni i i i ...\n\n>Hillary.\n\nI am standing up for my pr...principles and fighting to make women equal to men and the poor wealthy and the unclever wise and night not to be so dark.\n\n>Hillary, you are a liar and a clown for the masses and the willing marionette of the masters whose flagrant strings you deny.\n\nStop that isn't true.\n\n>Hillary. You know it to be true. Search your feelings, my love.\n\nNo, I'll never love you, you're a monster!\n\n>Stop lying to yourself, you know who the real monster is.\n\nAs Crooked fell dead, vanquished and invisible, Hillary saw the truth for the first time in her life \u2013 Bill was a cunt.\n\nDon comforted Hillary that night, not forgetting that the eyes of the nation \u2013 and the world, for that matter \u2013 (editor's note \u2013 and the transdimensional planes!) were fixed on Him and his new old love. He gazed into her burning eyes \u2013 burning with tears and regret and vengeance \u2013 and asked her one thing. Never lie again.\n\nCrooked was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl.", "Hillary looked into her savior's eyes and knew in that moment all could be set right \u2013 all the evil of Crooked \u2013 if only her man and our man became the leader of the free world. We can do it together, she gasped to her lover. We can do it together.\n\nDon mistook this endorsement for an invitation and kissed Hillary pasionately on the neck. He felt as her skin formed shy girlish goosbumps of innocent love at every kiss and lick and caress. He gestured that the cameras be dismissed and the crowd dispersed so he could have his love.\n\nAnd so his love could have him. And she did. \n\nIt moslty got in her hair but we'll call her a swallower anyway if it makes her feel good about herself. Women are weird.\n\nRemember, earlier, how I said some parts will be twisty? Buckle up.\n\nWith Crooked dead our Hero set off to slay the monster of his girl's youth \u2013 the demon Bill. Don asked his love Hillary where the lecherous father of Crooked would be found and Hillary told him the only two things she knew to be true of ol' Slick Willy. He loved saxophone music and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nDonald Trump was crushed. How could he find the elusive Bill with such sparse intelligence. Don't be so stupid, Donald! His father's voice rang in his ears. There are many things that are sparse, but your intelligence, my son, will never be! Don remembered his father so well \u2013 nobody had believed in him so much. And he knew the words were true. Donald Trump is a brilliant man.\n\nDon decided to narrow his search as much as possible using the data he had \u2013 saxaphone music and Vladimir Nabokov. After literally half an hour of unadulterated autism, Donald Trump discovered that a Jazz saxaphonist had been booked to provide entertainment on a jet called the Lolita Express. Don smiled to himself, thinking where else would Bill be than listening to saxophone music on a private jet named in honor of his favorite author?", "Wearing his customary suit and tie, all smiles, Dangerous Donald embarked on his greatest caper yet (ask about the time he saved Tokyo)! His private jet \u2013 TRUMP proudly emblazoned upon it like the banners of your countrymen \u2013 roared into the air chasing after Bill and the Lolita Express!\n\nThe Lolita Express was in a leisurly holding pattern over international waters. Lolitas don't like turbulence, Bill had said. The pilots had laughed dutifully then went back to not paying attention to anything but the front window. Watching for turbulence.\n\nTrump Force One, using very high enrergy, caught up to the Lolita Express and became the only turbulence of the day. Don was arguning with the crewman who finally relented and let him keep his signature tie on as he was strapped into the escape rigging. If you can't look amazing doing something, don't do it.\n\nThe heroism hatch on the back of Trump Force One opened, and Dangeour Donald \u2013 our hero, Hillary's man! - jumped out and aimed for the top of the Lolita Express. He landed with a gentlemanly thud and nimbly attached himself to the aluminum hulk careening through the skies at a breathtaking clip. He had to work fast.\n\nThe drill made short work of the emergency hatch, and Dangerous Donald was inside. He was a predator. Keen senses, sharp mind, charm and compure \u2013 these were his allies. He heard a lick of music...saxophone? Saxophone. Bill could be near. He crept closer to the sound and quickly came to a door. Looking through...cheerleader? Why were there cheerleaders here? For all the world it looked like a Jr. High cheerleading practice, but the girls all looked a bit sadder than usual. Curious.", "All that for another time though, because our Donald \u2013 Hillary's love, her hero! - heard Bill for the first time.\n\n>Come sit on my lap and ask ol' Bill what you want for Christmas, sugar.\n\nDon was shocked! Bill was clearly doing the good work of the Clinton Foundation, volunteering his valuable time to make Christmas bright for these at risk preteens. Maybe Bill Is A Good Man.\n\nNo! No, Crooked, you will never again arise! Bill's trick had almost worked on Don, but Don's inherent machismo saved him from the slings and arrows of the villain. With a heavy heart, Don recognized that even though Bill was being a perfect gentleman and noble with those young cute cheerleaders, he still must die.\n\nBill must die so Crooked can no longer torment Hillary.\n\nWith the war bellow of a troop of gorillas, Dangerous Donald charged through the thicket of young girls and seized lecherous Bill by his most dishonorable member. Don was not impressed by either the length or the girth and frankly his hand has never stopped smelling faintly of intern and homework. Grasping the demon Bill by the loins, Trump radioed back to Trump Force One and was whisked clear of the Lolita Express. He spared a thought to the young girls now left unattended with a jazz musician, but such things are racist.", "Donald Trump pulled evil Bill onto Trump Force One through the heroism hatch, which sealed behind them. Our Don relinquiched his hold over the demon's wand and asked Bill if he had any regrets for what he turned beautiful Hillary into \u2013 the pawn of Crooked, a monster of Bill's making.\n\n>I did it for the pussy bro.\n\nAnd Don wasn't even mad, because, lo, he did it for the pussy too. For he was not a cuck. \n\nBill was a cunt, though, so he must die. To save our girl.\n\nDon looked at Bill and asked if the devil had a last request.\n\n>Just lemme see it. I have to know.\n\nOur hero, great Donald, a man of his word and beyond all reproach, did drop his trow and bestow the gift of the Visage of the Don upon Bill. The length, girth, and pure aesthetics of our hero's D are only described in hushed whispers of awe in modeling agencies the world over. It was too much for one man to bear the immense responsibility of viewing. All Bill could say was\n\n>You're a big guy.\n\nDon, taking up his pants and holstering his magnum, smiled wistfully. He straightened his tie, perfected the angle of his french cuffs, and fingered the grip of his smaller gun. He pulled it out, admired the custom wood grips hand chistled by nuns in Abysinnia, and pointed it at the Monster.\n\n>For you.\n\nTwo bullets through its heart and his body falling from 30,000 feet, the demon Bill was slain.\n\nHillary \u2013 our girl! - was safe.", "Touching down on Trump Force One, Don greeted Hillary with a passionate kiss. She melted into his embrace, feeling as one. Feeling like home. The most improbable, vivid, true, interdimensional and transtemporal love affair of all time had come true. Crooked was dead. Bill was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl!\n\n>Don, I've taken care of everything. I've conceded the race to you, you're going to win the election!I know I'll never be the president I wanted to be, but I just wanted to make the world a better place all those years ago...before Bill. Before Crooked.\n\nI know, love. I know. You are a good girl, I've known it forever. You hated the lies and the tricks and saw what the merchants were doing to our country...but you were their unwilling stooge, Hillary. I love you. It's all over now. And I was wondering something, Hillary.\n\n>Y-yes, my Don?\n\nWould you like to be my vice president? Pence won't mind, he knows he is just there to shill to the evangelicals.\n\n>Really, Don? It would be a life's dream...and I know I do not deserve it!\n\nYou do, Hillary! You deserve the moon and the stars and the grandchildren to cover a continent! Please allow me to honor you as I may, since I may not as you deserve. I am, after all \u2013 he smiled \u2013 but a humble wall merchant.\n\nDonald and Hillary walked the Capitol steps as the first married couple to take the office of President and Vice-President, respectively. Over six million attended the greatest inauguration the United States has ever witnessed. Ovens were busy for weeks before hand baking all of the wedding cakes needed for the big day \u2013 many couples wanted their wedding day to coincide with the auspicious occasion of the inauguration. The whole country was in a giddy mood as Don and Hillary took office. It was a painting and a movie and a song that fills your soul.", "It was perfect.\n\nAnd in that moment, among the seven million, among the throngs and the press and the officials and the Chief Justice, Hillary looked deep into the sapphire wisdom of her love's gaze.\n\n>Don\n\nYes, Hillary?\n\n>If I asked something of you, here, now, in this moment \u2013 would you do it?\n\nFor my love I would move time and space and slay demons.

Michelson and Morley were proponents of the luminiferous aether model, which purported that all of space was filled with a fluid (the aether) through which electromagnetic waves propagated. They developed an experiment to test for its existence and came up empty. His real contribution was the development of the Michelson interferometer.\n\n\n2) Lorentz and Poincare developed the mathematical language (transformation matrices) that come up in relativity, but they didn't connect it to kinematics. They were trying to develop a way to transform electromagnetic fields between reference frames while preserving Maxwell's Laws. The result was the Lorentz tensor, and while this mathematical framework was used to produce new results in electromagnetism, neither Lorentz or Poincare pushed it any further.\n\n\n3) Einstein's contribution was wholly unique. Einstein showed that Lorentz and Poincare's results could be derived without any assumptions about the invariance of Maxwell's Laws, but instead falls out as a natural consequence of postulating a constant speed of light. Not only was he able to completely rederive all of their mathematical framework, but he took it a step further and applied these new transformation laws to Newton's laws, and in doing so uncovered all the phenomena we associate with special relativity - length contraction, time dilation, relativistic doppler shift, etc.\n\nMinkowski later accomplished something similar using a third, separate starting point - the assumption of a locally flat spacetime metric (Minkowski space).", ">>87407177\nDamn, this is OC.

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond.

It\u2019s important to note that GMO crop are to be made on a mass production scale and require heavy and expensive machinery (in order to keep up production) that poor farmers- especially 3rd world farmers- cannot afford. Unlike normal, natural plants, GMO crops (seeds) do not come back every year and must be repurchased from Monsanto with money that farmers do not have! There was a mass suicide among farmers in India over a ten year span that started in 2005 simply because they, as poor, 3rd world farmers, could not meet Monsanto\u2019s requirements and fell into financial ruin!

Monsanto has patented (copyrighted) GMO seeds, making them illegal to use/ sell unless paid for. Many crops, such as corn, are wind pollinated and can easily contaminate a neighbouring farmer\u2019s organic crop (via wind). \n When their crop tests positive for GMO and they don\u2019t pay Monsanto- they sue the farmers and succeed in doing so! See how they can scare farmers?!\n These crops, because of how large the sale is, must be maintained with the use of chemicals. (Chemicals synthesized by Monsanto as well). As stated before, Monsanto\u2019s use of pesticides and fungicides contain chemicals that are very harmful to us and the environment. It\u2019s odd how a chemical can kill all the plants (weeds) around the crop but not the actual crop itself. When it rains on these crops, its causes a toxic runoff that drains into bodies of water and pollutes them! Hence why it\u2019s only recommended to eat fish once a week, as their mercury levels are so high (and for some reason we take that as fact and we\u2019re all okay with it!)\nThe only financially reasonable way we can help is to spread the word and raise awareness of this company and what\u2019s its doing to us and our planet.

Don't want to sign the contract? You won't get GMO seeds.\n\nFarmers find the increased profitability from using GMO seeds to make it worth the extra costs.\n\nFor many crops such as corn, you wouldn't save the seeds anyway. In the US, very few farmers have saved corn for seed since the very early 1960s or later 1950s. It has nothing to do with GMO organisms.\n\nSome crops such as corn are what are called F1 Hybrids or First Generation Hybrids. The parents of the corn are of entirely different varieties of corn that are bred, by hand, specifically to produce the new hybrid. The new hybrid is very uniform in terms of its larger size and in maturation date.\n\nIf you replant the corn and grow it, the second generation corn will not be very uniform. It will mature at different rates and produce different sizes of corn. The result will be less profit. The price of seed corn is low enough that you should make a better profit with the F1 Hybrid seed corn than you would with the second generation if you did save it.\n\nAs far as I know, neither Monsanto nor any other seed company has ever sued someone based on the patent.

When the virus found a cell with the right markers, i.e. a cancer cell, it would replicate itself inside the cell destroying the cell in the process. Only those with the cancer cell being attacked would become ill and the illness would cure them of the cancer!\n\nHowever, I doubt that we will see that because of the issues of the virus mutating to attack other cells.

It has almost 100% been Jews who have been pushing this, making my life dark and depressing. I felt gross inside and out. \nWhen I stopped listening to Jewish lies I can't tell you how everything changed.

We had a lot of patients, but the only ones who would game the system or come in only for pain meds were black. The only ones who got violent were black. My apartment complex was dangerous as fuck, but the whites seemed benign while the blacks were fucking gangbangers. That destroyed the idea that everyone is equal, because in a place where all other factors are equal the blacks were disproportionally violent. Due to their culture and genetics, they behaved differently. That was an undeniable fact of what was going on around me. If you went to the neighbourhoods with low income and no blacks it seemed like a struggling area but with a sense of community. If you were where I was, then it just seemed like every single person was out for themselves and would be violent and animalistic to get what they want.\n\nThe second bit was being diagnosed with GID, and seeing how the left treats trans people is ridiculous.

We've just had 8 years of a black president and it looks likely that we'll have at least 4 years of a woman president, and frankly so much of the world is hugely sexist and racist that this hurts our positions internationally, weakens our ability to negotiate. We simply WILL NOT be respected as much. Furthermore the obsession with social justice at home has lead us to push positions and issues which are frankly incompatible with most cultures on Earth. It was easy to press for democracy and freedom when the impression given off was that countries would be able to keep their existing cultures mostly intact. It's much harder to do now that we've packaged such values along with things like gay and transgender rights, 'human rights' most countries don't respect and don't care for.

They may also thrust rhythmically against you, so enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer that a minute or two.
