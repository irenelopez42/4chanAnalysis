Since 1979, he has published the Global Competitiveness Report, an annual report assessing the potential for increasing productivity and economic growth of countries around the world, written by a team of economists. The report is based on a methodology developed by Schwab, measuring competitiveness not only in terms of productivity but also based on sustainability criteria. He has authored and co-authored several books, including The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2016),[19] Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution (2018, with Nicholas Davis), COVID-19: The Great Reset (2020, with Thierry Malleret), and Stakeholder Capitalism (to appear in 2021, with Peter Vanham).", ">Foundations \nIn 1971, Schwab founded the European Management Forum, which in 1987 became the World Economic Forum, as a not-for-profit foundation committed to improving the state of the world. He founded the WEF in 1971, the same year in which he published Moderne Unternehmensf\u00fchrung im Maschinenbau (Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering). In that book, he argued that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten), to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. Schwab has championed the multistakeholder concept since the WEF\u2019s inception. In 2015, the WEF was formally recognised by the Swiss Government as an \"international body\". Under Schwab's management, the WEF has been keen to promote its image as a driver for reconciliation efforts in different parts of the world, acting as a catalyst of numerous collaborations and international initiatives. In 1998, Schwab and his wife founded the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, another NGO based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2004, Schwab created a new foundation using the US$1 million prize money from the Dan David Prize he received that year from Israel. The Forum of Young Global Leaders aims to create a dynamic global community of exceptional people (under 40) with the vision, courage and influence to drive positive change in the world. In 2011, he founded the Global Shapers Community, a global network of local communities, or \"hubs\", of young people aged 20 to 30 who are exceptional in their potential, achievements and drive to make a contribute to their communities.

He also exercised a number of other functions, such as being a member of the Peres Centre for Peace and a member of the board of the Lucerne Festival. During the earlier years of his career, he was on a number of company boards, such as The Swatch Group, The Daily Mail Group, and Vontobel Holding. He is a former member of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group. He is honour member at FC Bayern Munich.

In recent years, studies have suggested that low-level RF exposures that don\u2019t generate heat\u2014non-thermal exposures\u2014may be able to disrupt the activity at cell membranes as well as cause oxidative stress and even cell death.\n\n>But the data that firmly linked the experiences of the diplomats to RF exposures came from studies looking at pulsed RF exposures. \u201cThere was significant research in Russia/USSR into the effects of pulsed, rather than continuous wave (CW) RF exposures because the reactions to pulsed and CW RF energy at equal time-averaged intensities yielded substantially different results,\u201d the report notes.\n\n>In a review of Russian-language studies, researchers found that \u201cpulsing may be an important (or even the most important) factor that determines the biological effects of low-intensity RF emissions.\u201d The report notes that some of the studies involved exposing military personnel in Eurasian communist countries to non-thermal microwave radiation. Afterward, the military personnel reportedly experienced eerily similar symptoms to those reported by the diplomats. That is, they experienced headache, fatigue, dizziness, irritability, sleeplessness, depression, anxiety, forgetfulness, and lack of concentration, as well as internal sound perception from frequencies between 2.05 to 2.50GHz. Other studies have since backed up the finding that pulsed RF can have wide-ranging effects on the nervous systems of animals and humans, including negative effects on cognition."}, "replies": [">RF exposure can also explain the bizarre auditory and sensory experiences reported by the diplomats, the committee noted. For this, the experts turned to data on the \u201cFrey effect,\u201d which was identified by American researcher Alan Frey in 1961. Frey found that pulsed microwaves can essentially be perceived as sound by humans, even those who are deaf. In summarizing some of Frey\u2019s findings, the committee\u2019s report noted:\n\n>The areas near the ear were most sensitive to these RF exposures; modulating the RF energy could produce a variety of effects including the perception of \u201cbuffeting of the head\u201d or pressure on the face/head without dizziness or nausea, a \u201cpins and needles sensation,\u201d and a sound described as a \u201cbuzz, clicking, hiss, or knocking\u201d within the head for RF frequencies between 0.4-3 GHz, depending on pulse width, pulse-repetition frequency (PRF), and peak power density\u2026 Frey reported these symptoms with an RF source transmitting at 1.3 GHz (which provides the greatest absorption depth into cortical tissue) with a PRF of 244 Hz, 6 \u03bcs pulse width, peak power density of 267 mW/cm2, and average power density of 0.4 mW/cm2. Others have demonstrated that GHz range, pulsed RF energy (~14\u03bcs pulse width) interacting with common materials can produce external sounds that are audible to nearby humans.\n\n>Last, the committee also noted that the pulsed RF explanation also fit with the common report from diplomats that the episodes they experienced were only in \u201cspecific physical locations near windows or as originating or emanating from a particular direction.\u201d", "Bump.

Meet the optimal 21st century man.\n\nHave you ever heard of the song, \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\"? It's rather famous, but if you haven't, it's a song from the 70's band King Crimson. The song itself may only be vaguely related to the Vietnam War, and materialism, but the title, oh the title. In the modern era, the Schizoid Man is truly dominant. \n\nIf you wish to be independent from the pursuit of family life (which you shouldn't), then you should make your net impact as positive as possible. Learn, learn as much as possible. Mental wealth transcends Jewish wealth in every way. The ego, unbroken, is a tool used to manipulate you.

Innovation helps to make their life individually better but with increased complexity of innovation large parts of the own population are exempted from participating while foreign groups slowly creep up their sleeves. Individualism is best displayed in capitalism, which results to sell own technology for capitalist gains (Imagine Greeks selling the Spartans selling their blueprints and knowledges honed for hundreds of years to Persians - you can't). Since they are not *that* individualist, they slowly replace the original workers (Example: corrupt Indians in California hiring each other, Silicon Valley) using the very same society, tools etc. created by its inventors.", "Individualism also is at fault for the no-kids situation since individualism enforces the homo economicus mindset.

This was because they faced racial discrimination in the form of political disenfranchisement and the denial of civil, religious, and social rights.[17] Formed in 1816, the American Colonization Society (ACS) was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders. Quakers believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S.[6][18] While slaveholders opposed freedom for enslaved people, they viewed \"repatriation\" of free people of color as a way to avoid slave rebellions.[6]\n>In Slaves to Racism: An Unbroken Chain from America to Liberia, Benjamin Dennis and Anita Dennis argue that the Americo-Liberians replicated the only society most of them knew: the racist culture of the American South. Believing themselves different from and culturally and educationally superior to the indigenous peoples, the Americo-Liberians developed as an elite minority that held on to political power. They treated the natives the way American whites had treated them: as inferiors. The natives could not vote and could not speak unless spoken to. Just as people of color were prohibited from marrying white people in most of the United States, the indigenous Africans could not by law marry Americo-Liberians. Even when some indigenous Africans became educated in Western ways, they were broadly excluded from government positions.[24] Indigenous tribesmen did not enjoy birthright citizenship in their own land until 1904.[9] Americo-Liberians encouraged religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia#Early_colonization\n\nHas happened already.

Laws, the judiciary, sentencing for wrongdoing, arrests, etc... are these forms of censorship? \n\nIf you answered no, then you agree with not only preventing verbal harm on the internet but preventing it in all other spaces as well.\n\nRemember - physical violence is illegal in almost every circumstance, and physical violence is almost always temporary and really not so bad. Someone punches you in the face, very very hard. Ouch! You lose a tooth, maybe. Usually not in my experience but I have strong tooth bones. Maybe someone punches you in the tummy and the wind is knocked out of you. That hurts, but soon enough the pain is gone and so is the wind. Physical violence, though illegal, is usually not so bad.\n\nSo why is emotional violence tolerated? Why is it legal to inflict emotional wound on others that almost always last a lifetime? I still remember the first time I was talked down to by someone whomst I believed my better anyway. This person said I was \"a complete and total fag\" and I have never gotten over that. To complicate things, I did in fact become a homosexual. Was he clairvoyant, or just incredibly intuitive? Did I tip him off somehow? Whatever it was, he hit the nail on the head and I've not forgotten it and never will.\n\nSo why should we not censor the internet if the internet is where most emotional violence happens?

Jews are \"a closed society\" that uses \"anti Semitism\" to quash criticism, which is considered \"hatred\" or \"self-hatred.\" Shahak says Judaism is largely a primitive, materialistic, authoritarian credo. \n\nJews have been held prisoner by Judaism which is the template for the NWO. First Jews, then Masons and now all humanity is inducted into this satanic cult. A satanic cult exploits and controls its members by corrupting and making them sick. \n\nThe Talmud is devoted to Jewish supremacy and contempt for Christianity and non-Jews in general. The Cabala embraces many gods including Satan. (Shahak, p. 33)\nJEWS COLLABORATED WITH NOBILITY\n\nThe following is a brief summary of Shahak's argument in the chapter, \"The Weight of History.\"\n\n1. In spite of persecution, Jews throughout history formed an integral part of the privileged classes. The poorest Jew was immeasurably better off than the serfs.

In fact, in many ways they have dramatically improved.

Its theorists all also claim the moral right to argue in bad faith in return.

This is why I hasten to uproot and tear out this deadly opinion. I said that the synagogue is no better than a theater and I bring forward a prophet as my witness. Surely the Jews are not more deserving of belief than their prophets. \"You had a harlot's brow; you became shameless before all\". Where a harlot has set herself up, that place is a brothel. But the synagogue is not only a brothel and a theater; it also is a den of robbers and a lodging for wild beasts. Jeremiah said: \"Your house has become for me the den of a hyena\". He does not simply say \"of wild beast\", but \"of a filthy wild beast\", and again: \"I have abandoned my house, I have cast off my inheritance\". But when God forsakes a people, what hope of salvation is left? When God forsakes a place, that place becomes the dwelling of demons.\n\n(2) But at any rate the Jews say that they, too, adore God. God forbid that I say that. No Jew adores God! Who say so? The Son of God say so. For he said: \"If you were to know my Father, you would also know me. But you neither know me nor do you know my Father\". Could I produce a witness more trustworthy than the Son of God?\n\n(3) If, then, the Jews fail to know the Father, if they crucified the Son, if they thrust off the help of the Spirit, who should not make bold to declare plainly that the synagogue is a dwelling of demons? God is not worshipped there. Heaven forbid! From now on it remains a place of idolatry. But still some people pay it honor as a holy place.", ">>279183183\nJudeo-satanic is redundant.

You will never find two beings or people that are absolutely equal which means one will always excel above the other at least in some capacity.\n\nIf you use the concept of equality as a goal for your society you have wrung it's death knell. for three main reasons.\n\n1. Equality will elevate those that ought to not have as much status, or recognition or freedom as others. It elevates murderers and rapists to be considered the same as Saints, and the charitable. It elevates children to the authority of adults. This is an unnatural action and cannot be maintained, children are not capable of making adult decisions. To make them equal is to accept chaos because those things cannot change their nature and are not inherently equal.\n\n 2. Because all social animals are inherently hierarchical. There is a reason that most people are essentially sheep, and its because the majority of people cannot rule themselves. People crave structure, a system that works, leaders and mentors to look up to, mothers and fathers to raise them. Hierarchy is an innate demand of all social species, there isn't a single social animal, or nation that has ever existed that doesn't maintain some sort of hierarchy. Trying to disobey natural laws leads to the end of society. Without a good hierarchy people are lost and give in to their own desires or constantly seek that leader or structure they never had.\n\n3. It destroys competition, and therefore it destroys innovation. To push equality is to push people into positions they are not capable of doing, and to push those who are capable into lower positions where they cannot meet their full potential. It keeps things in either a state of degradation or stagnation, which is a death sentence for any nation. Once again lack of competition does not occur in any species, all being must struggle to survive and this struggle is what makes them strong and innovates them to improve themselves."]}, "275580553": {"op": {"timestamp": 1599041753, "title": "Penis size", "comment": "How much does penis size matter in the year 2020?\n\nI'm not trolling, I'm only 18 years old and 5 inches and I'm scared about how much degenerate slut culture has affected girls, how am I supposed to settle down with a girl when they all only want 7 inches and above"}, "replies": ["Try having a bigger dick you kangaroo fucking faggot", "slide thread", ">>275580553\n5.5 inches here\nIt sucks when my gf makes fun of my dick but we make do", ">>275580553\nYour no better than a nigger if penis size really means that much to you.", "It doesn't matter you've just watched too much porn.

In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\" -Viktor Frankl (a holocaust survivor I know but its a pretty based quote) First be aware of that space. Next try to grow that space as much as possible without feeling bad when you indulge in the response. Don't punish yourself for failing. Practice growing the space. For instance when you want a drink, have a glass of water or something else first. Then have another NA drink after your first drink. You aren't denying yourself the drink, you are just delaying it. The better you get at delaying the more you will be ready to quit, until the day that you actually do. Like with smoking, only smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes a day is certainly better than smoking 10, and easier than smoking none. Eventually you won't need to smoke anymore.

All of this is an effort to restore the treason that was happening at the behest of China under the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nEuropeans depend heavily on Russian oil / gas. They do not like Russia having a lot of leverage over them in this way. Poland / Ukraine are the eastern border of Europe as far as Western Europeans are concerned, so they want NATO running a defensive corridor there.\n\nThe Middle East primarily sells oil / gas to China. They do not have pipeline access to Europe, and the United States blocks pipeline access to China via Afghanistan (which we occupy, for this exact reason).\n\nIn the middle of the Obama regime, they toppled Egypt / Libya, specifically by supporting rebels in eastern Libya. You probably don't know this, but eastern Libya is the highest per capita recruiting grounds for al-Qaeda anywhere in the world. They are the ones who were largely responsible for building IEDs that killed most of our troops in Iraq. Lots and lots of American blood on their hands. These are the people Obama supported against Gaddafi however.\n\nWhy? Libyan weapons stockpiles were shipped to Syria. The plan was to overthrow Syria and then Turkey. The intention here was to open a pipeline path from Saudi Arabia to Europe. The easiest way to do this is Jordan / western Iraq > Syria > Turkey > Europe\n\nThe fallout of such a pipeline opening up goes like this: Saudi energy becomes cheaper than Russian (easier to extract than Russian, but comparable delivery prices once a pipeline is available from Saudi Arabia to Europe). Europe switches to ME energy. Russia then has to switch to selling to China. Afghanistan is no longer valuable real estate in controlling Chinese energy sovereignty.

It's a big long, but I'll post the whole thing:\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-jewish-american-pedophiles-hide-from-justice-in-israel/\n\n>Tel Aviv \u2014 It's a tense stakeout, waiting for Jimmy Julius Karow to appear. He is a wanted man and is considered dangerous. Accused of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in Oregon in 2000, he fled to Israel before authorities in the U.S. could apprehend him or figure out where he went. Karow has been running from U.S. law enforcement ever since. Currently INTERPOL, an inter-governmental policing organization that works with 194 countries, has a Red Notice to alert police worldwide that he's a fugitive.\n\n>Two years after he fled the U.S., Karow was convicted by an Israeli court of child molestation in a separate case. He served time and was released. Now another alleged Israeli victim has come forward, saying he began abusing her when she was 5-years-old, and continued for years.\n\n>Karow has successfully evaded authorities by moving between communities in Israel for almost two decades, and he is not alone. \n\n>A widespread problem\n\n>A CBS News investigation has found that many accused American pedophiles flee to Israel, and bringing them to justice can be difficult. \n\n>Jewish Community Watch (JCW), an American organization that tracks accused pedophiles, has been trying for years to find Karow and help bring him to justice. \n\n(Part 1)"}, "replies": [">>244399143\n>JCW says Karow and other wanted men and women have been able to exploit a right known as the Law of Return, whereby any Jewish person can move to Israel and automatically gain citizenship.\n\n>Since the small organization started tracking accused pedophiles in 2014, it says more than 60 have fled from the U.S. to Israel. Given its limited resources to identify these individuals, JCW says the actual number is likely much larger.\n\n>\"The same thing that is going on in the Catholic Church right now around the world, the exact same thing is happening in our community,\" JCW's founder Meyer Seewald told CBS News. \"The cover-ups are the same, the stigma, the shame.\"\n\n>Seewald says tightly-knit Jewish communities across the U.S. will sometimes meet accusations against a member with incredulity, and that can have a chilling effect. \n\n>\"Everyone goes and surrounds this individual and supports him because they can't believe a person can do such a crime. They take the abuser's side and the abuse continues,\" Seewald says. \"They put him in another community. A few years later, he's done the same thing and we hear more allegations that the person is abusing children. Victims don't want to come forward when they see that.\"\n\n>JCW says the majority of its cases originate from modern Orthodox to Ultra-orthodox Jewish enclaves in the U.S., but that it happens across the wider Jewish community. Because perpetrators can't be held accountable unless victims come forward, many cases are believed to go unreported. To try to get them out into the light, JCW holds awareness events across the U.S., and offers victims of sexual abuse advice and emotional support. \n\n>Mendy Hauck decided to come forward after receiving support from JCW. The father of two says he was just 8-years-old when he was molested by a teacher at his Orthodox Jewish School in Los Angeles. Hauck says the abuse started one day when a friend brought in cookies for his birthday. \n\n(Part 2)", ">>244399179\n>\"I actually went ahead and reached for the biggest cookie and he said, 'Put it back and you could come back by recess and get your cookie,'\" Hauck said. \"So after he handed out the rest of the cookies to the other classmates, I had to stay behind if I wanted my cookie, and I did. He called me up to his desk... and that's when he started... rubbing me.\"\n\n>His alleged abuser is Mordechai Yomtov, a then-35-year-old Hebrew teacher. \n\n>\"I jumped backwards like a step or two and he grabbed my hair and said, 'it's fine, you can come close. I won't hurt you. There is nothing wrong,' and he did it again,\" Hauck recalls.\n\n>Hauck says the abuse continued over the course of the year. He says he felt trapped, with nowhere to turn. \n\n>When the year finished, Hauck moved on to the next grade. That's when Yomtov's crimes caught up to him. In 2001, police arrested and charged him with committing lewd acts with three of his other students, ranging in age from 8 to 10. But Hauck never told anyone about his ordeal until years later.\n\n>Yomtov eventually pled guilty, served time in jail and was released on probation. But once free, he violated his probation by fleeing to Israel via Mexico.\n\n>JCW tracked him down and confronted him in Jerusalem with a hidden camera. Yomtov admitted that he violated his probation and illegally fled the United States, with help. He also said that in Mexico he obtained a fake passport in order to travel to Israel, where he lives illegally. \n\n>Yomtov denied abusing Hauck, but offered a general apology to his victims, saying: \"I'm very, very sorry. I hope that God will help every single person who went through this. Please forgive me.\"\n\n>It wasn't until 2016, when another alleged victim of Yomtov and friend of Hauck's came forward, that Hauck felt compelled to tell his story. He filed a police report hoping to get justice, but says the processes has been slow. For him, justice is twofold.\n\n(Part 3)", ">>244399211\n>\"I want the (LA County District Attorney) to step up their game \u2014 you know, actually fight to get him back here and give him what he deserves,\" he says. \"And also, I want the communities to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\n>The district attorney's office told CBS News there has been no request to extradite Yomtov back to the United States, and declined any further comment. \n\n>Red flags, more victims\n\n>Help from the community is a reoccurring theme. Rabbi Yehuda Oppenheimer knows first-hand how a pedophile is able to flee to Israel. In 2000, he unwittingly helped Karow escape.\n\n>The two met when Karow expressed interest in converting to Judaism. One day, Karow suddenly said he wanted to move to Israel. \n\n>When asked whether there was nothing at all that raised red flags up to the point when Karow said he wanted to move to Israel, Rabbi Oppenheimer responded: \"I wish I could say that [it didn't raise any red flags], but unfortunately, I can't\u2026 He [Karow] said, 'I plan to go to Israel, I need to go much more quickly than I thought I needed to go.\"\n\n>\"He said that there was something in the past that happened when he was young but nothing had ever happened since. I felt that I could trust him. So I wrote him a letter, he bought a ticket and he left.\"\n\n>Oppenheimer gave Karow the contact information of family and friends in Israel to help him settle. Then one day a close friend called the rabbi. \n\n>\"I'll never know exactly what happened but something severely sexual\u2026 something happened with their daughter, and [Karow] was arrested.\" Oppenheimer says it felt like \"a punch to the gut. It was very painful.\"\n\n(Part 4)", ">>244399254\n>He says he carries that guilt to this day, and that's why he came forward with his story. He has a message for other rabbis and community leaders:\n\n>\"When somebody has offended in this way, the odds are that they will do so again, no matter how kind and pious and wise and nice and charismatic they are,\" Oppenheimer says. \"You simply can't trust them. You have to take steps to prevent, you cannot have them around youngsters, you cannot have them in your home.\"\n\n>One of the girls Karow allegedly abused in Israel is \"Amoona.\" She asked us not to use her real name, to protect her family. \n\n>\"I was 5, 4 or 5 years old. My mother was on bedrest. My father is a rabbi so he wasn't home. (Karow) used to come to our house. We used to play games and then it became sexual.\" \n\n>The alleged abuse took place over the course of more than two years. A July 2019, Israeli indictment against him details allegations of severe sexual abuse, including rape and sodomy. She says he would threaten and manipulate her to keep her quiet. \n\n>\"'I'm going to give you a cookie because you do it so nicely.' It's all about the cookie it's all about lying and it's all about being so evil to a little child,\" Amoona recalls him telling her. \"He also threatened and to kill my parents. He would choke me. He would hold me.\"\n\n>Inaction, even protection? \n\n>Amoona is angry that Karow was allowed to enter Israel in the first place, but JCW's chief operating officer Shana Aaronson says the failure begins in the United States. She says there are elements of the Jewish community in the U.S. that are willing to help pedophiles escape.\n\n>\"Oftentimes there's some sort of community incentive, either somebody owes them a favor or someone in the community, let's say an institution, has covered up for them in the past and they know that if this goes to court there's a lot of civil liability coming down the line,\" she says.\n\n(Part 5)", ">>244399283\n>While Aaronson puts blame on Jewish communities in the U.S. and the U.S. government for not aggressively pursuing extraditions, she says Israeli authorities have also failed to prioritize the hunt for suspects. \n\n>She tells CBS News it would be easier for the police to locate and arrest Karow, for instance, but it has fallen instead on the JCW to track him down. \n\n>Israel is known as a nation on the cutting edge of technology, but Shana says that doesn't trickle down to local law enforcement. Shana says police don't request background checks of perpetrators arrested in Israel who have recently moved there from other countries. They don't even do a Google search, she says.\n\n>\"The general standards and protocols for investigations by local police are poor,\" she says. \n\n>JCW says the problem reaches into the upper echelons of Israeli politics as well. They note that Yaakov Litzman, leader of an ultra-orthodox alliance in Israel's legislature and the current minister of health, has been accused of preventing the deportation of a Malka Leifer, a former head teacher at a Jewish school in Australia, where she is wanted on multiple charges of child sexual abuse.\n\n>CBS News obtained an Israeli police recommendation that says there is enough evidence against Litzman to recommend he be charged himself with fraud and breach of trust for protecting Leifer. Litzman's office told CBS News there was not any wrongdoing. It's now up to Israel's attorney general to decide whether to indict the lawmaker.\n\n>\"It's a good example of the lengths the community will go,\" JCW's Aaronson says. \"It's really disappointing and disgusting.\" \n\n>Israeli police wouldn't comment on specific cases but insist they take the cases seriously, and that they coordinate \"closely with the Ministry of Justice and worldwide police organizations in order to find suspects overseas.\"\n\n(Part 6)", ">>244399318\n>The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on specific cases too but praised their relationship with Israel's law enforcement, adding sex offenders have been successfully extradited in the past. \n\n>The stakeout\n\n>On the day of the stakeout, JCW received its best tip in months \u2014 that Karow was going to be at a clinic in Tel Aviv. They know he is 6'2\" and over 200 pounds, but he could have changed his appearance, and previous attempts to capture him have failed. \n\n>\"Obviously the fear is that he'll figure out that someone is looking for him and he'll bolt,\" Aaronson says, clutching an old photo of JCW's target. \n\n>An ambulance pulls up and a man steps out with a bandaged right arm. He fits the description of Karow. Aaronson's team confirms his identity and calls the police. \n\n>Within five minutes a police officer on a motorcycle arrives and they move in to make the arrest. \n\n>Karow is brought out by two officers. He doesn't look surprised to be in custody. We ask him if he assaulted a girl in the United States. \n\n>\"No,\" he replies. He denies fleeing to Israel but doesn't answer when asked if he assaulted girls in that country. He says he knows he's wanted under an international arrest warrant. \n\n>Karow now faces charges in both Israel and the U.S. \n\n>The District Attorney's office in Clackamas County, Oregon, told CBS News it was \"working with federal authorities to secure his extradition.\"\n\n>Outside the clinic, Aaronson calls Amoona to share the news of Karow's capture. In Israel, victims are allowed to confront alleged offenders before trial. Amoona brought a box of the same cookies Karow used to manipulate her, to throw back at him. \n\n>\"It was good to confront him,\" she says. \"To have that closure in my life.\"\n\n>Meanwhile, Mordechai Yomtov remains at large. \n\n(Part 7/end)", "Wew, and /pol/ says mudslimes are the ones who rape kids", "And of course /pol/ doesn't say shit, go figure", "it's just we already knew", ">Israel hiding Jewish criminals \nThis is sad but it's not a new phenomenon.", ">>244399143\nAnd money launderers, human traffickers, mafiosi, ...", ">>244400164\n>>244400092\nSo it's cool?
