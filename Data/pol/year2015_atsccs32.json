Your FOIA request must reasonably describe the records you are asking for, which means that the text of your request must allow an agency employee to find the record(s) with a reasonable amount of effort. Assume the FOIA officer is not familiar with your topic. Many agencies search for documents electronically so, if you know them, you should list the relevant keywords and phrases.\nMake sure your request is reasonable in scope. Agencies are not required to process unreasonably broad requests or requests that require them to create documents.\nProvide a date range for records or a date of the event you are researching. Providing a date helps the agency narrow the scope of the request and find the documents you are most interested in. If you do not give a date range, the agency will search all of its records, which could generate hundreds or thousands of pages. This could lead to lengthy delays, and the agency could contact you to narrow the request.\nProvide accurate titles and full names, and include any news stories discussing the subject of your request. In other words, help agency employees by providing relevant pieces of information. If you are aware of common alternate spellings for names or other key words, you may consider including them to aid in the search. News stories or other supporting materials will help the person processing the request to understand its context.\nKeep your request brief. Include necessary supporting information, but avoid narratives or excessive supporting materials that may confuse agency staff.\nSpecify whether you want the records in paper form or electronically. Agencies are required to release records in electronic form when requested, if they can reasonably do so.\n\nhttps://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/foia-tip-writing-a-good-foia-request-part-ii/", "Don't worry, CIA is on our side.", ">>58426284\n>/pol/ is a board of peace, you bigot.\n\nTop kek, based aussie shitposter.

A new tenant moved into an apartment in an adjoining building \u2013 a single woman and her 3 daughters (living crammed into a tiny 1 bedroom apartment). Within months, this new family was a fixture in our home. So much so that I finally asked if we could establish some boundaries between our family and theirs. Instead, my wife informed me that she and the neighbor were in love and I was the one who needed to leave the home.\nI begged my wife to try and work on the marriage, but she refused. I then reminded her that we barely had enough money for one household in NYC, let alone 2 (she had always refused to work). She said that the lack of money was my problem, not hers. So, we started divorce proceedings.\nWhile we worked on negotiating a settlement, she move in with her lover. Three months later, we had hammered out a (very generous) agreement whereby she would get to live in our brownstone for 2 years at which time we would sell it and split the equity. The agreement stipulated that her lover would NOT be permitted to live in my home as the family therapist had warned us both how confusing that would be for our kids."}, "replies": ["The day before we were supposed to sign the agreement, I came home (at this point, I was still the one living in the building) and found my wife taking apart my belongings, and moving herself back into the residence.

You just assaulted me and I'm calling the police.\"\nI thought she was joking or bluffing, but sure enough, she dialed 911 and reported an assault. The police came and she showed them a small red mark on her knee (the sort you might get from bumping your leg against a wall). The police were apologetic but they explained that they were forbidden to dismiss any complaint involving domestic violence. With that, they arrested me and I spent the next 36 hours in jail.\nA condition of my release was an automatic order of protection which was granted her, effectively barring me from my own home. Once free, my lawyer informed me that my ex had fired her lawyer and hired a new attorney who immediately yanked the negotiated settlement off the table. I was also told that she would not permit me to see my children (despite the fact that I had them 50% of the time before this incident). We proceeded to go to trial.", "Fast forward 6 months: My ex, of course, immediately moved her lover and family into my home (my 10 year old son is now actually sharing a room with her lover's 10 year old daughter). My lawyer was sure the judge would slam her for this outrageous action but the judge just said to me, \"it's almost 2013, get over it.\"\nThe criminal matter won't go away. I even took a polygraph test and passed it with flying colors. She of course refused to take one. This did not sway the district attorneys office to drop the charges. I then had the family therapist write a letter on my behalf stating that he didn't believe I was capable of acting violently towards my wife, and moreover, he believed that she was very capable of lying to manipulate the situation. This also did not make any difference. That trial is scheduled for February.\nI am now sleeping on a friend's pull-out couch while she sleeps with her lover in my old bed.\nI have spent over $50K in legal fees.

Googling the names of these fairly well-known individuals will give you some accounts and what-not, but my personal experience with them gives a more comprehensive picture that is, quite frankly, despicable.\n\nWhere to begin? Well, in 1994, a young Jewish-atheist-Holocaust denier called David Cole made the headlines by appearing on Donahue, where he promoted his independent documentary. He soon became notorious, as his coverage concerned how abhorrent his perspectives were. Historians recognized him for his appetite for attention, rather than soundness for bold claims. Aside from the professional scrutiny, David Cole soon found himself in the sights of the public and in 1998, he seemingly vanished off the face of the earth for fear for his life.\n\nIn actuality, he changed his name to \"David Stein\" and seemed to turned his attention to legitimate historical documentation of the Holocaust. His new name gained traction and he began to consult with big names from all walks of life, all the way up to those in the Executive Branch. In Hollywood, he hosted parties that catered to A-list celebrities and politicians.\n\nBy 2008, Stein was deeply involved with the Right-Wing group, Republican Party Animals, which hosted a number of highly-successful parties. In fact, Stein took up administration of the group's web presence. By this time, he had become involved with the up and coming actress and model Rosie Tisch, who helped invigorate the Republican Party Animals by attracting men in the vicinity."}, "replies": ["In late 2011, however, the relationship of Stein and Tisch faltered and by 2012, Stein had left his girlfriend of five years.\n\nIn early 2012, a new player entered the scene. At a Republican Party Animals meeting at a restaurant, the group's hectic presence necessitated additional staff to be brought in, so the aspiring B-list Scream Queen Jennifer Lynn Warren arrived and served Stein's table. Stein befriended the lady and they began to hang out, with even Warren's mother being treated by him.\n\nStein recognized Warren as not being good for a relationship, as she was heavily involved with the drama of her mentor and roommate, Pruitt Taylor Vince. Additionally, she acknowledged that she was working with aspiring Indian director Nikhil Prakash, who was hoping to get in her pants, in exchange for his production services.\n\nThrough stalking, Rosie Tisch found out about Stein and Warren's friendship. Tisch began to address Warren with derogatory remarks, including \"Pig Nose\", which Warren mistook for a compliment and a new friendship blossomed. Tisch told Warren about her break-up and Warren responded by berating Stein for something she was not involved with. To say the least, the short-lived friendship was over.\n\nTisch had not had enough, however, and publicly declared that David Stein was the adopted name of the infamous and long-lost Holocaust denier, David Cole. Instantaneously, once-again-Cole was removed from the Republic Party Animals and upon hearing that he still maintained his extremist and controversial perspective of the Holocaust, his friends and professional associates cut him from their lives.", "Two years later, with the release of his new book regarding his wild ride with Tisch called \"Republican Party Animal\", Cole was contacted by a young man pretending to be a lawyer called Ryan Miles. This guy admitted that he was not, in fact, a lawyer and had been goaded with the affections of a woman he wanted to sleep with. The woman, who happened to be Warren, wanted to strong-arm Cole for trashing her in his book... even though she was not mentioned once. Sure, Ryan Miles did become her boyfriend... because, as she tells people in her social circles, he is a young, unknown and talentless book writer who is out of competition with her.\n\nWhile I have heard people describe these kinds of situations as \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\"... I don't even know how to fucking classify that with this one! I mean, this shit that I have seen firsthand is just trash and I can't even contain myself anymore.
