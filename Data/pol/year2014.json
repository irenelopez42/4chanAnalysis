They are feared and respected but also looked down as apes sometimes.\n\nCommies are looked upon with disdain by everyone. No surprises here.\n\nLib arts are the vast majority so no one really has thoughts about them. I find many are either way too serious about whatever impractical shit they're studying, or hilariously self-deprecating and have resigned to their fate as a Starbucks barista. It really is a mixed bag, anon - people are all different. But the main thing I've seen is that most of the libarts kids are going to school because society expects them to and their parents can afford it. They're there for the quintessential \"college experience,\" not to get an education.\n\nBecause STEM is so rigorous, the kids who don't actually want to go to school for it drop out fairly quickly. Most kids either do it because they know it'll quite literally pay off, or they do it because their parents forced them to (many kids from China/Korea who end up in chemistry/pre-med fall into this boat).", "STEM basically means money, it has absolutely nothing to do with actually bringing diversity to fields that are highly skewed, like welding, carpentry, or pouring asphalt.", ">>39749225\nP&G, started off as a process engineer with a background in chemical engineering/polymers\n\nMoved to a different division in our company to make that sweet $130k + stocks bonus.

Unlike other STEM majors, chemistry and chemical engineering tend to have a 50-50 ratio rather than the classic 95% male demographic.\n\nRealistically, though, it's good to be diverse. Just because you are in STEM doesn't mean you need to meet and hang only with girls within STEM.\n\nMost of the guys and girls I know (and myself included) dated outside of engineering, because it's way too fucking stressful to spend all of your time with an engineer when both of your lives consist of being constantly stressed.\n\nDiversity ain't always a bad thing to have. If you want to meet girls outside of STEM, get involved with clubs/extracurriculars (I assume you're in uni/college). It is by far the best way to meet people.", "If you want to meet girls while in STEM, do nursing.", ">>39749860\n\nThat's awesome. Thanks for the reply, dawg.

His extreme physical weight makes it much harder for him to navigate properly across the room's floor littered with empty Mountain Dew bottles and all kinds of various dragon dildoes. He seats himself on his dirty and run-down chair which groanes at the shock of his two-hundred extremely heavy pounds bearing down on it and presses the start button on his outdated computer. As his computer boots up with a humming sound Shlomo picks up a dossier from the trash-littered floor and examines it. It's his trusty old manual made by the JIDF, containing various instructions for debate with anti-zionists in online forums. He proceeds to open the dossier with his fat and very smelly hands. One of Shlomo's fat arms accidentally knocks down one of his countless empty vaseline tubes and underneath exposes an old picture which he had long forgotten. Shlomo was utterly surprised to see it was still there. \"Oh Miranda, you dirty gentile Shiksa, why wouldn't you love me?\", Shlomo whimpers under his heavy breath. Suddenly all of his repressed and painful memories back from high school return to Shlomo. Being rejected by his love, her filthy goiim friends laughing at him, him starting to cry and running off like so many times before. To this day he remains a bitter and hate-filled virgin. He always blamed the gentiles for his own failures.\n\"I don't need this stupid Shiksa anyway! Or any inferior white gentile cattle girl for that matter!\", Shlomo bitterly mumbles filled with his own impotent anger, and proceeds to throw the picture of Miranda into the trash which is already filled to the brim with used kleenex tissue papers.", ">>37800741\n\nFinally logging into his computer Shlomo is greeted by his home wallpaper consisting of a huge black cock. After discovering the internet he soon found an outlet for his repressed sexuality by fapping to cuckold porn. He wanted to approach Teyrone about his feelings just so that he could lose his virginity before he turned 25.\nStill, Shlomo had not found the courage to talk to Teyrone or anyone except for his mother after he finished high school for that matter. \"I always just wanted to suck your black dick, Teyrone... \", he sighed.\nShlomo opens up his outdated internet explorer and searches on bing for 4chan's \"politically incorrect\" sub-board. Suddenly he remembers his mother's words. She always told him to get a job in real estate or become a lawyer like his father Moshe David Stein Goldowitz.\n\"Please get a real job Shlomo! I'm begging you!\", she would say, but she just doesn't understand. She doesn't understand how utterly important it is to protect the chosen nation of Israel from these scumbag stormfags and arab palestinians on the internet whose ultimate goal it is to wipe him off the map! Shlomo now begins to type on his keyboard: \"Fucking racist stormfags, listen up here...\"\nAfter a short time of posting on 4chan Shlomo is sweaty and frustrated yet again like so often before. \"FUCKING GOYIM SCUM!\", he agressively yells at his computer monitor. Shlomo is so upset that he actually knocks his Applejack pony figure off his desk.\nLittle Shlomo sniffs his tears away and forces himself to calm down for a little while.\n\"I'm sorry Applejack.\", he says. Shlomo then turns to his wall which he has covered in JIDF, MLP and cuckold posters. In the midst of this most unholy mess is a framed picture with the arch words \"REMEMBER THE 66 BILLION\".\nNow Shlomo euphorically salutes his wall, and with a burning passion for Israel in his heart, sitting in his mom's basement, he types endlessly:\n\n\"Oh, you gosh-darned goyim stormfags...\"", ">>37800741\nThat's the same exact the video i was watching when you posted that\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dDtRtGdcZA", ">>37800018\nhooked up = making out now?", ">Be me, 18 year alpha\n>Throw Halloween party last year because my parties are the shizzle\n>dress up as myself because I'm already so bad ass\n>feelcompletelynormalbadass\n>people arrive at party\n>Drugs, alcohol, promiscuity everywhere\n>feelsgoodman\n>see faggot fedora neckbeard barely fitting into a walmart made nazi uniform, poorly made talking to my gf\n>she calls him a fag and walks away\n>faggot goes up to my sound system and unplugs it\n>pic related...it's the faggot\n>he says we are degenerates and will be punished to hell\n>laugh our asses off\n>throw neckbeard out of party, he's crying like a school girl whale\n>whole school laughs at him from then on\n\nfelt good fucking gf after party, twice", ">>37800290\nlol at thinking you won't have to talk to people to get a) that job or b) the credentials required to get that job", ">>37800518\n>things that never happened", ">>37800861\nHoly shit, really?

The reproductive window for women is generally only 40-60% of their total lifespan.\n\nThis difference in reproductive capability results in differing reproductive strategies in order to produce the best offspring. These strategies are almost entirely driven by instinct, certain conscious decisions can effect them, but the underlying drive for procreation that these strategies are predicated on is hardwired.\nIn dimorphic species, males will attempt to mate with nearly every female they come in contact with, this is the best strategy for genetic legacy. The more mates, the more likely some of his offspring will survive. This guarantees females will have reproductive opportunity, and because females have guaranteed genetic legacy, this allows females to be selective for the optimal mate.\nMales with many sexual partners have not only been selected as optimal mates by those many partners, they have ensured that their genetic line will continue. That is why they are considered *studs*. Women with many sexual partners have suppressed their biological drive for reproductive selectivity, or completely lack it, therefore likely to produce sub-par offspring, and are a genetic liability. That is why they are considered *sluts*.\n\nAs humans we have the ability to consciously understand that much of what drives dimorphic reproductive strategies in reference to promiscuity does not really apply to us, but that does not change the fact that we are still animals driven by sub-conscious instinct. That instinct tells us promiscuity in women is a genetic liability, and no amount of political correctness, social engineering, or slut walks is going to change that.", ">>37802703\n>If you're hooking up with a chick for casual sex you're no less a degenerate then her.\nAbsolutely wrong.

After years and years of political positioning, most of us have no clue as to what issues are passionate concerns of this woman. For those who follow Warren, such is not the case, at all. More than this, in making her indecision known, Hillary has allowed for the notion that she is more of a danger to Obama's legacy than is Warren. \n\n\"According to the Post, Valerie Jarrett and M. Obama, both 'haters' of Hillary, are working behind the scenes for a Warren candidacy as they try to convince H Obama of a Warren run for the presidency. Understand that there is nothing that demonstrates the pettiness of Michelle Obama and Jarrett more than their dislike for Hillary, a discontent that is without foundation -- purely personal and as unprofessional as it gets.\"", ">>37024235\nlol Well if we're fucked lets run Monica Lewinsky.

Assuming Hillary would win that battle, a huge assumption, the past-First Lady would come out of such a battle, far less the progressive's choice, than before the primary process, very much 'damaged goods.'\" \n\n\"We are about to discover the strength of the 'Marxist/progressive' influence within the Democrat party.

I think he also would not appeal to the Midwest (ie. OH, MI, MN, IL, and WI). Republicans are permanently walled out of the West Coast and I don't think he would appeal to Hispanics enough to win New Mexico or Nevada. The best case scenario for Christie is that he wins Ohio's 18, Pennsylvania's 20, Virginia's 13, Florida's 29, and New Jersey's 15. That gives Christie 301.

The single white woman, lacking the beta provider hubby (ironically, mostly by her own hand) seeks to fill his absence with the alternative \u2014 the looming Big Man tribal leader, which in modern America is the federal government, and its shaman is Obama.

And just like an alpha provider/protector, the government is very good at forcibly extracting tribute from the beta male masses.\n\nOn this last factor, the American growth industry of single moms is certainly pushing the country in a more redistributionist direction, because no demographic outside of blacks, gays and Hispanics is more generally and reliably pro-government handout than the single mom with kids to feed and no dad around to help out.", ">>37027095\n>>37027064\n>>37027027", "Run of the mill/base D's already have Hillary in the back of their minds, she should take the primary with little argument or fuss and dems will have established a consensus very early, if they haven't already.

This intern leads to a secondary infection with said phagocytes exciting outside c3b receptors causing increased lysosome production. The lysosomes work in reverse releasing digestive enzymes such as lysozyme and protease outside of the phagocytes cell walls into the blood stream. This causes a massive dip in potassium levels and can stop the heart.\n\n\nAny blood cell not destroyed by immune system creates more copies of the virus. The process of reproduction releases toxins into the blood stream some of which severely damage the kidneys leading to renal failure.

How many races there are and what characteristics are used to determine racial identity is entirely subjective, since there is no such thing as a \"race gene\" or a series of genes that define race in the absolute sense. Race is therefore a social construct and not a physical science, even though it is based on genetics. It is no more meaningful to say that a person is of a certain race than it is to say that they were born in Indiana rather than Illinois.\n\nCategorizing people by race is also non-sensible and irrelevant. Consider the entirely feasible example of a girl born to a white European and a native African marriage. Given the different races involved, which one would she be considered? More importantly, how could it possibly matter? Would being either \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d or something in between make her any different of a person?\n\nRace also serves as the foundation for racism, which tries to emphasize distinctions between racial categories \u2013 arbitrary as they may be. Racism is the \u201cscience\u201d of drawing broad conclusions from comparative studies, which are then assumed to apply to all members of a particular group who happen to share a genetic profile over which they have no control. \n\nRacism is deeply flawed because it is fundamentally irrational. Human beings are not groups, they are individuals.\n\nThere is not one scientific or cultural fact that can be determined about an individual based on their race. One cannot know what music another person enjoys, how they vote, how high they can jump, nor any meaningful thing about them simply by knowing their race."}, "replies": ["In fact, all racial stereotypes dissolve at the individual level. No matter how fast one runs, how quick one thinks, or how moral one\u2019s character, there can almost always be members of any other race found who better excel at each of these \u2013 or any other imaginable measure. There is simply no such thing as a meaningful racial stereotype. People are generally whoever they choose to be.\n\nThis makes perfect sense to intelligent people. Since racial identity is arbitrary, it cannot be deterministic. Without determinism, there can be no science. Therefore, neither racism nor the study of race has anything factual to offer. \n\nIn addition to being a false science, racism is morally wrong because it is the foundation for racial discrimination, in which different rules and standards are applied to individuals based on their presumed identity. In the past, people suffered tremendously (and unfairly, of course) because of this.\n\nThus, the artificial system of race serves no positive purpose. Lending legitimacy to the flawed theory of racial distinction leads, almost inevitably, to racism and the justification of racial discrimination. This, along with the inherent absurdity of even classifying people by race, should be enough to merit junking racial identification altogether.", ">>34044090\nThis reminds me of something. Not too long ago, I was thinking about the concept of evolution, and all organic life having started somewhere, with all organisms being (very, very distantly) genetically related to one another.\nWhat particularly struck me was that, as species evolve over the eons, each individual organism is the same \"species\" as its parents and as its offspring.\nBut of course, if you examine two organisms separated by a few dozen thousand years, even if they are genetically related they could be considered different \"species.\"\n\nWhere do we draw the line between different species? How much genetic difference is required between two organisms for them to be considered different species?\n\nSimilarly, just how different does one human have to be from another for them to be considered different races?\nI'm not denying that there are genetic differences between individual humans, obviously there are, but at what point do those differences become enough to warrant being considered a different race?\n\nAnd what about people of mixed race?

Who decided that whatever your local city counsel says is the law? An important answer to that question is to notice that most munincipalities are incorporated -- they are corporations. That's why cities have charters. These charters are typically granted by the county or other provincial equivalent. What gives the counties the authority to do that? They get it from the state (or province) that created the county. In the US the \"several states\" are sovereign and thus have an inherent right (in other words, a natural right, aka God-given right, not the kind of made up bullshit \"right\" that some mafia government decides to enforce upon you.)\n\nFor an interesting story, look at the land reform act in England somewhere in, I think, the mid 1500s that turned all the largely unregulated land into a careful system of hierarchical administration.\n\nOr the Administrative Procedures Act, just one of the gems you get to pass when there's a Great Depression (hint hint).\n\nOr why what we commonly call \"London\" is really the \"City of London,\" a \"medival anachronism\" as Wikipedia correctly cites. (The origin here lies in the city-states of Northern Italy that assumed power in the wake of the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire.)\n\nYet another interesting avenue is called the \"Manufacturers Certificate of Origin,\" part of the UCC, which is why you don't actually own your own car, and why they can force you to have a license in order to drive -- many people mistakenly propose that driving represents a privledge rather than a right because they don't actually understand the underlying legal or philosophical basis.\n\nAs for the UN? \"Might makes right.\" I suppose some would derive its power from some treaty or other.

It tells us that at least some witness stories about bodies being recovered at Roswell are true. It also destroys the Air Force's absurd explanation for the bodies as misidentified \"crash dummies\" tested in the 1950s and 1960s. \n\n\"IN THE 'DISC' THEY WILL SHIP\" tells us that the crash object was being called a \"disc,\" not a balloon or any part of a balloon, and that it had an interior with contents worthy of shipment. Balloons or radar targets (what the Air Force is still trying to sell as a misidentified \"disc\") have no insides with anything that could be shipped. The radar targets, in fact, were two-dimensional, balsa wood kites weighing only a few ounces. The balloons had nothing inside but helium gas.\n\nEven if every other word in the Ramey memo was contested as incorrect, these two phrases alone are sufficient to tell us that the Roswell events were about recovered bodies and an object called a \"disc\" (with an interior compartent containing something important), just as witnesses have been telling us for nearly the last quarter century.\n\n(Note: The font of the printed words below the phrases represent actual teletype font of that period.)", "http://www.roswellproof.com source.", ">>31043157\n>mogul scientist\n\nthe what now?", ">experimental aircraft\n>some jamoke claims \"zomg ufo! gubmint conspiracy!\"\n>government doesn't want to claim it was an experimental aircraft\n>government is like, \"okay, let them think it was aliens\"\n\nbam. it's completely reasonable that the government just never felt like correcting hicks who thought it was aliens", ">>31047966\n\nsomeone who owns a lot of science", ">>31042905\nit was a high altitude manned balloon project, meant to have the USAF spy on the Soviet Union's radio transmissions."]}, "30922585": {"op": {"timestamp": 1402161036, "title": null, "comment": ">Daily reminder that democracy is a shitty idea as long as people are given the option to vote for objectively inferior ideas"}, "replies": ["THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN DEMOCRATIC STATES IS NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO \"VOTE\" FOR INEFFECTUAL, OR DETRIMENTAL THINGS/POLITICIANS, BUT DEMOCRACY ITSELF.", ">>30922585\nDemocracy is an excellent idea.\nThough not everyone deserves to vote.
