Russia has been preparing a military operation since the start of 2021 (so for the entire year basically)\n2. Russia is issuing an ultimatum to the west, and its demands are: either you reduce your presence in post-soviet space, or we solve the problem our way.\n3. The amount of forces Russia committed to the war in 2014-2015 is comparable to 8-12 BTGs (one BTG can be 800-1,200 personnel)\n4. The potential Russian operation planned for early 2022 could involve anywhere between 50 to 100 BTGs.\n5. Russia has set up not only assault forces on the border, but also territorial control forces (meaning it is planning to hold on to large chunks of territory after the initial op)\n6. Russian leadership doesn't care about Javelins, or how many weapons the west sends to Ukraine, because political leaders never really care about tactical-level weapons to begin with. It's the problem of the generals to figure out how to minimize losses against tactical weapons, not the job of the politicians.\n7. Russia is viewing the war as a Plan B, but it already did everything to fully prepare for Plan B, to make it physically/materially viable. The political establishment in Moscow is increasingly engaged in an echo-chamber of convincing itself that war is the only option.\n8. The US/NATO have no tangible ways to prevent this war, aside from conceding to Russia's demands to leave Ukraine, and reduce their forces in Baltics.\n9. Decision to use war as a viable way to achieve Russia's goals seems to be fairly solidly established in the Kremlin, and the question for them is only to figure out when going to war would be less costly?

I bet every tranny here has some female sycophant you tells you \"you go girl\" and encourages your degenerate behavior. She probably even occasionally talks to you about \"girly\" things, maybe asks you to go shopping, maybe she even asks you to go to the bathroom with you when you're out. It not only makes you feel valid when she does this, but it lets you know you might just have a chance with her, or if not with her, maybe one of her girlfriends. Isn't sisterhood great?\nHere's the truth, she is hanging out with you, or if it's an online relationship, even talking to you, for two reasons:\n1. You are the equivalent of a purse puppy to get her social justice points when she brags about having a trans girlfriend\n2. You make her look 100x more attractive in comparison. The more trannies there are, the hotter every real woman looks in contrast. Your existence makes a 1 into a solid 5, and a 5 look like a 9.\nWomen interact with you only as a product of a crude calculation, which is what trannies always are - they know other women will be forced to give deference to them due to their progressiveness and, more importantly, that you increase her odds of landing a Chad. You are nother more than a number to your galpals, once again. They don't like you. You are not \"friendsies\" or \"girlfriends\". She will NEVER fuck you. You are a tool in every sense of the word for these enablers and when you kill yourself, you give her infinite social points to turn it into her own suffering.\nNo one will remember you, and she will sit pretty atop the social bounty that is your grave.\nI know this because I am a woman and I have seen trannies do this many times.

Russia is a zionist occupied government, just like America, China, and Europe. Putin is an ethnic Jew on his mother's side, which makes him a racial Jew by the strictest yid standards of inheritance.\n\nPutin and Xi know what you refuse to accept and what we've been warning about for 20 years, which is that America is collapsing. Putin is trying to make himself seem reasonable so when Russia conducts an \"invasion\" of America under the guise of intervention and aid, the common man will welcome it instead of shooting his ZOG soldiers to death on sight. Russia and the Taliban are actively courting the American public, because they know how the game is played and they know what's going to happen next. I would expect Xi to begin doing the same thing soon, unless he decides he wants to focus on Africa. \n\nThe irony is that a faggot memeflag shill who only comes here to crank out shart threads for bait is actually far more likely to eagerly line up to lick Putin's boot when he does eventually send people over to \"help.\" \n\nDon't worry.

Niggers are stupid and easy to enslave or exterminate if you're willing to just kill them on sight. He could easily rob a third of Africa of it's resources while everybody else is busy, and I suspect that's exactly his plan. \n\nXi doesn't care about America. He wants to turn Africa into a bauxite mine and he wants Australia as a forward military base and stripper casino for Beijing. ZOG leaders and shabbos goyim are in on the plan. It's why they're all fleeing the continential United States as fast as possible and buying up condos and McMansions in New Zealand. It's why Zuckerberg married a hideous chink and made sure his kike heir of a son would be a happa. \n\nAll signs point towards Xi not caring about the future of America. But I think Putin and some other ZOG interests care quite a bit. The collapse is inevitable at this point, but they don't want some kind of populist autocracy to reform out of the ashes and create an entire continent of angry and motivated white men. They have clear self-interested reasons to interfere and try to guide the rebuilding in a direction that favors them. \n\nWe'll see how it plays out. I don't think it's going to go according to their plans. The vaccine rollout certainly didn't. You'll notice Putin remained silent on the issue until it became obvious which direction the wind was blowing. If most people had accepted the vax, he would have never spoken out against it.

His mother's name was Maria Ivanovna Shelomova. Shelomova is a Jewish surname, and is literally a Russian variation of Shlomo. His mother was an ethnic Jew, and several mainstream sources even admit this. If his mother is a Jewess, that makes Putin an ethnic Jew by any Jewish racial law you care to name or use. \n\nChina is ZOG. Russia is ZOG. America is ZOG. Europe is obviously ZOG, you can't even criticize the Jews there. You're some fat retard from the American midwest who was born to Protestant parents but then \"rebelled\" by becoming Orthodox, even though you don't understand the first thing about it.

When technocrats, occultists and elites began to fund and/or use people's taxes in institutes like Tavistock, for research involving mind control, ritual abuse, promotion of new age ideas (and here the ETs come in) etc., a contrary dissent emerged (funfact: it was the same one that brought the MKUltra to the attention of the public), but what they wouldn't expect is that the hole was lower and government agencies were dealing with magic and extra-dimensional beings. Amazed, this group gained a fundamentalist character, thinking that the only way to fight this would be to transform the US into a theocracy, and from then on they were committing several unethical acts to avoid a greater evil.

Scientists assume that the main reason for this is not primarily sex, but rather intimate social relationships.\n\nIn bottlenose dolphins, a subspecies of dolphins, all males are bisexual. The homosexual encounters help the social structure of the dolphin groups. At a young age, male dolphins form a particularly close relationship with another male dolphin which solidifies over time and grows into a lifelong partnership. The same-sex couple become companions, traveling long distances through the ocean together and defending each other. When one partner sleeps, the other keeps watch and protects him from predators such as sharks. Even during sexual maturity and reproduction with female dolphins, the homosexual relationship between the male dolphin couple remains. When one partner dies, the \u201cwidower\u201d often remains alone for a long time.

Rothstein disclosed that the CIA conducts the \u201chuman compromise\u201d operations worldwide while the FBI serves to cover CIA tracks where leaks occur, concluding that about 70% of top US government leaders are compromised through CIA coordinated child sexual abuse operations.[11] A prime example is the CIA-Mossad Epstein-Maxwell operation. Decades ago, while working with fellow NYPD law enforcement associates and their Scotland Yard counterparts, Rothstein determined that an organized web of an international child sex trafficking network actually existed and has been thriving ever since. Detective Rothstein explained that:\n\nVIP members met at various world locations where each destination catered for a different type of degenerate sexual proclivity, including \u2018satanic-themed\u2019 abuse.[12]", ">>325295211\nBased", ">>325295607\ngibs jobb 2me", "I got what I came after.

The FBI in Lincoln swiftly invaded Caradori\u2019s office along with forcing his childless widow to turn over investigative files at their home, thus stealing all incriminating, smoking gun evidence linking the sitting US president to his murderous pedophilia-drug network.", "So DeCamp set forth writing his powerful expos\u00e9 indicting the murderous pedophiles in power. But in recent decades while the pedophilia epidemic has surged, the complicit mainstream media has remained silent, sweeping everything under their filthy fake news carpet. A few years after William Colby uttered these chilling sentiments about what he knew too well, in April 1996 his mysterious \u201cdrowning\u201d death is speculated to be the result of Colby\u2019s reported plan to expose the CIA for sexually abusing and misusing children for political and diplomatic blackmail as part of its mind control program.[97] And in 1990 Nebraska, instead of placing the ex-CIA director as the next lead investigator after the Caradori murder, a central figure in the investigation stated that the state legislative committee grew cold feet and couldn\u2019t have selected a more incompetent choice as the next replacement chief investigator, local attorney Kirk Naylor.[98]", "Incredibly, a week after investigator Caradori\u2019s murder, the Nebraska state grand jury in Lincoln soon followed by the federal grand jury in DC completely disregarded the mountains of evidence, never even calling King to the witness stand, dismissed the inquests calling the entire Franklin affair \u201ca carefully crafted hoax.\u201d[99] Senate committee chairman Loran Schmit was extremely disheartened that the forces of evil were able to defeat his mission to uncover the truth and lay out all the evidence for the grand juries to indict and prosecute the guilty parties, concluding that the justice system is so corrupt where truth becomes falsehood and right becomes wrong.[100] Sadly, that is exactly the objective of Luciferians, through cunning deception and pure evil they are extremely skilled and adept at inversely twisting everything around.[101] We can clearly see that with the Bush-Clinton-Obama dynasty\u2019s New World Order.", "As mentioned in previous chapters, there exist numerous so called charity organizations around the globe working closely with children from within CIA front companies, the child \u201cprotective\u201d welfare system, international adoption agencies, to global war zones and refugee camps collectively feeding off the innocents.

I'm almost 27, and it's hard to believe that being 16 and 17 years old was a decade ago. I drank a lot, and wasted a lot of my youth being drunk. If you drink, I recommend you stop. It isn't going to make you feel better. Of course, by now I think you know that. I was drinking every day (or at least every other day) by the time I was 18. Got drunk for the first time when I was 15, started drinking heavier by 17, and by 18 I was drinking a case of beer nearly every single night. I went through literally hundreds of beers a month.

I could light bonfires with all of the empty beer cases I had laying around. It seems that the last 10 years went by in the blink of an eye. I know some of you know what I mean. I blinked and it was gone. I wish sometimes that I could take back some of the years, but I can't. And it won't do any good to wish for something I can't have. That kind of wish will burn you out.\n\nI've been a loser for a long time, but I don't have to continue that way. You're only REALLY a loser if you see the problem and DON'T fix it.

The Jews know the White slaves are not a threat and will never revolt, leaving the only possible threat to the Jews being the brown people.\n\nThe Jews genetically castrated the White race in WW2, killing off 100% of fertile men with the capacity to fight and defend themselves, leaving only the spineless, meek, cowardly, and mentally ill to reproduce. These slaves are incredibly docile and guillible. Brown people are harder to control, so the Jews want to pollute the Brown animal purity with the genetically culled White slave stock. The Jews want to make brown people more dociile and gullible, so do to this, they're trying to pollute the blood of brown people with White altruist genes. Look at mulatto people, all of them \"act white\" and have white tendencies, they lost most of their animal savagery with the only bit left being feigned due to confusion about their dark skin but inability to \"be black\" or be accepted by black people. \n\nAnother advantage is that mixed race people are raceless, so they cannot have \"race preference\" and instead can only identify with the group \"everybody\", which pidgeonholes them into faggot liberalism which defends \"everybody\" and puts race mixing on a pedestal. Ironically, mixed race people have very little favor compared to their race-mixing parents because the goal was the race-mixing, once a mulatto, the person is treated as \"basically white\" by the Jews.", ">>315003948\nUnderated", ">>314998121\n>women in the priesthood\nDo Americans really?", ">>315004505\nFrench ((ppl)) have always been race mixing weirdos", ">>315004474\ni would stab your face 100 times", ">>315005361\nAww u changed your vpn and put a meme flag on now what a sad faggot u wouldn\u2019t stab u shit u pussy", ">>315004409\nhawt", ">>314998121\nI hope some based rednecks make a sport out of hunting these things down during the coming tribulation.", null, ">>315004923\nThis is why advertisements are all race-mixing of White/Black or otherwise, rather than actual mixed race people.

Fucking kike-tier shit. Women are animals that don't have moral agency. Women biologically evolved to be submissive to men, if they didn't, then women would be able to physically challenge and overpower men, which they can't. \n\nWomen didn't biologically evolve to have freedom or independence from male dominance, so expecting women to function well with freedom is like expecting niggers to function well in civilization despite evolving to exist in the absence of civilization.\n\nThis isn't to say that real men exist, as if they did, the women and niggers wouldn't have gotten loose.

The same is true about Jews, because Jews are demons and don't have moral agency or free will, they were sent by God to tempt you unto damnation, literally \"enemy NPCs\" to test and see if you will fight to the death n the name of God or voluntarily remain enslaved by the Children of the Devil. \n\n>Pic related\n>Also Hitler was a kike\n\n>>315004923", ">>315005865\n>Keep pos", ">>314997527\n>>314997566\n>>314997657\n>>314997709\n>>314997789\n>>314997846\n>>314997888\n>>314997928\n>>314998016\n>>314998071\n>>314998122\n>>314998177\n>>314998213\n>>314998249\n>>314998315\n>>314998391\n>>314998462\n>>314998549\n>>314998649\n>>314998834\n>>314998889\n>>314998995\n>>315000503\n>>315003922\n\n>>315006390\nproving once again that women aren't funny", ">>315006588\n>BLAH BLAH BLAH\n\nFuck off chirstkike, you won't be in my society, it worships the true gods.\n\nHusbands and wives and husbands are meant to be loyal to eachother and nice to eachother forever.", ">>315006699\nPost tits", ">>315000747\nis he gonna be ok", ">>314997602", ">>315006390\n>This isn't to say that real men exist, as if they did, the women and niggers wouldn't have gotten loose.\n\nIf you read the post, you would realize that Western \"men\" are not men. \n\n>If man cannot control his beasts, then he is nothing more than a beast himself.\n\n\n>>315006390\n> i am a biological woman\n\nAgain, you don't understand what I'm saying. I don't have an opinion of you. I can have an opinion of your father, your brothers, and men who have influenced your life. I cannot have an opinion of you because you don't have agency. Women are incapable of acting without the consent and \"permission\" of men, meaning that men can easily stop anything a woman is capable of, thus a man needs to allow any action a woman commits.\n\nA woman cannot be \"bad or good\" because their actions are not determined by their own agency, but instead by the men that control the women. Whether you are bad or good is irrelevant because you are entirely the product of the men who control you, even if they exert this control by refusing to control you.\n\nI'm going to presume you're a kike/tranny/faggot shitposter because if you're a woman on this website you're probably a monster physically, psychologically, and socially. That being said, you don't have agency, so I cannot condemn you for being the product of the whims of men who control you. \n\nI am actually willing to believe you are a woman with a vagina for being submissive to my words, actually reading them, which takes a higher level of insecurity to actually acknowledge what I write. Most men are bullheaded and just condemn me without trying to read, but you made an attempt, showing you seek to \"please\" those who \"appear powerful\", which is a womanly trait.\n\nAgain, few if any Western men have agnecy. Look at them. They complain online and expect somebody else to \"do the work\", they expect someone else to \"do the heavy lifting\", and they just complain and sit at home all day.

There are few true Gods. Most Gods are derelict or unstable, think of how the Aztec rituals crippled their civilization, think of how the Jewish-Canaanite rituals are crippling the West currently. To think of \"true Gods\" being eternal Gods, there are very few. \n\nRealize that Christian God is one of the few that explicitly commands his people to exterminate the Jews (Deut 20:16). God explicitly \"predicts\" that when you tolerate the Canaanites, then your civilization will succumb to their vices. That's the only reason I need to support that God. You shouldn't need one either. If anything, you should hate \"Christians\" because they don't listen to the Commandments of their God or understand how their faith has been corrupted into a Canaanite faith.\n\nThat's the point here. Even if a homeless alcoholic black man tells me \"You need to exterminate the Jews or they will teach your people corrupt and abominable rituals\", he is still equally as correct as God.

As such, it is supposed to always be used as an adjective or adverb for those goods or services (e.g., \u201cI use the Google search engine for Google searching stuff on the web\u201d), never as a noun or verb for them (e.g. \u201cI googled it\u201d). Using a mark as a noun or verb will cause the mark to become generic - the mark will become the common word used to describe the good or service and will no longer function as a trademark. Aspirin, escalator, and yo-yo are former trademarks that have become generic terms. So what can I do?\n\nNever capitalize google Always use it as a verb or a noun The real killer, use other trademarks in combination with google as a common word \u2013 e.g., DuckDuckGo for safer googling, a Bing google turns up better results, etc. Push google/googling as a common term for search/searching in online dictionaries, in forums, etc. If enough people do this enough times, google will lose its trademark.

Openness to, and engagement in, a critique of nationalism has seemed greater. And while it has been vital to our purposes in Ireland to examine nationalism, doing the same for imperialism is equally important and has a significance far beyond British/Irish relations.\u201d\n\n>\"Imperial powers use a mask of modernity for cultural suppression, economic exploitation, dispossession and domination,\" says Higgins. \u201cThose on the receiving end of imperialist adventurism were denied cultural agency, assumed to be incapable of it, and responsible for a violence towards the \u2018modernising\u2019 forces directed at them.\u201d\n\n>\"British imperialists did not recognise the Irish as equals, he says. \u201cAt its core, imperialism involves the making of a number of claims which are invoked to justify its assumptions and practices \u2013 including its inherent violence.

Biden for his 10th term 2060\n\nThe year is 2045. The southern United States lives under BLACK RULE. All white males are sissified. White women live to serve BLACK KANGZ in vast reproduction facilities. Welcome to America's BLACK FUTURE.\n\nAlex Lang remembers life before the revolution \u2013 before the government-issued hormones, the sissy wigs, frilly lingerie, and mandatory chastity. He lives on the war-torn outskirts of New Africa, where he hides his beautiful blonde step-sister Kaylee from the clutches of the brutal New African army.\n\nAs musclebound black soldiers prowl the countryside searching for fertile white women, Alex will stop at nothing to protect sweet Kaylee's purity. In his pink-and-blue wig, flirty sissy skirt, and fishnet stockings, Alex gives his tender white body to a gang of pitiless black alpha soldiers: the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice. But is sissy Alex prepared for the overwhelming demonstration of power and domination? The encounter brings him face-to-face with his worst fears... and his most unspeakable sissy fantasies.\n\nAcclaimed author and pro domme Whitney Ryan presents a tantalizingly political vision of the future. Her powerful, vivid, fly-on-the-wall passages of three-on-one interracial man-on-sissy action push the boundaries of sensual fiction. The BLACK KANGZ have their way with Alex's sissy body, pumping and pounding and cursing through one of the hottest gang scenes in the history of the genre. And interspersed throughout the sizzling prose, a suspenseful narrative full of imaginative world-building unfolds.\n\nExperience the true power of black bulls in black jackboots. Prepare to pay the ultimate reparations.
