He finds, second, the natural world around him, the nature-given habitat and resources which economists sum up in the term \"land.\"[3] He finds also that, in seeming contrast with animals, he does not possess any innate instinctual knowledge impelling him into the proper paths for the satisfaction of his needs and desires. In fact, he begins his life in this world by knowing literally nothing; all knowledge must be learned by him. He comes to learn that he has numerous ends, purposes which he desires to achieve, many of which he must achieve to sustain his life: food, shelter, clothing, etc. After the basic needs are satisfied, he finds more \"advanced\" wants for which to aim. To satisfy any or all of these wants which he evaluates in accordance with their respective importance to him, Crusoe must also learn how to achieve them; he must, in short, acquire \"technological knowledge,\" or \"recipes.\"\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/crusoe-social-philosophy", ">>149829856\nRule 1.

Neither Paul nor the scriptures provide a clear-cut answer to this question.

It's only like 45 minutes.\n\nThe gas chambers are a myth, just like the myth that Nazis made soap out of human fat (from Jewish concentration camp prisoners). The soap accusation was later debunked by historians but was repeated by some Jews well into the 1990s. Even today you might find some people repeating it as fact, such is the power of stories that are believed on faith rather than evidence. Other accusations never caught on to the same extent because they were simply too unbelievable.\n\n\"Holocaust survivors\" admit that they heard rumors about the gas chambers from other Jews before even arriving at a concentration camp. Thus if a Jew lost a loved one during the war, they simply assumed they had gone to the gas chambers. Even after the Allies investigated a camp and determined it was not a death camp, Jews who had been there would repeat the story because they felt they were doing a good thing for the \"victims\". Insodoing the myth is reinforced without a shred of truth or evidence.\n\nGas chambers did exist, but were a life-saving measure to exterminate Typhus-spreading lice in clothing. That's why eyewitnesses often include details like haircuts & showers (life-saving pest deterrant measures). Despite these efforts, Typhus (aka \"camp fever\", \"ship fever\", etc.) resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in the camps - possibly 200,000 by the end of the war going by Red Cross reports. That's why the camps needed crematories. But those deaths weren't planned, in fact the Germans tried to prevent them, and total nowhere near 6,000,000.\n\nYou can hear directly from Jews, and learn more about the improbability of the story, why the numbers claimed to have been killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz is scientifically & technically impossible, in the following video.

Technology forms and creates our desires. It doesn't do so by intending to do so, it does so in a non-intentional way. I think the issue is that their use of \"means-ends\" is misleading.

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[6] These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress.[7] The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.[8]\n\nAutism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[2] Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine.[9] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes;[10] for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[11] In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.[8][12]", "Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.[4] Although there is no known cure,[4] there have been reported cases of children who recovered.[13] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[14] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[15]\n\nGlobally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015.[5] As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 1\u20132 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD as of 2014, a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012.[16][17][18] The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%.[19] The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice;[18] the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.[20]", null, "Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder[21] that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission.[22] People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others.[23] Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,[24] and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.[25] It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.[26] Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.[27]", ">red pill must watch videos\n\nAmerican senator tells the other side of the story: https://youtu.be/0FNtEWfay_8\n>Ron

consulate worker \u2013 local media\n\nAnkara has issued a detention warrant for a second US consulate worker, Hurriyet newspaper reports. It comes after Turkey's justice minister urged the US to reverse its decision to suspend visas for Turkish citizens.\nThe wife and child of the second employee are also being questioned by police.\n\nIt follows the arrest of Metin Topuz, a Turkish citizen who worked at the US general consulate in Istanbul. He is alleged to have ties to exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for a failed coup attempt last summer.\n\nA court has ruled that Topuz will remain in custody while his alleged links to Gulen are investigated.\n\nTopuz's arrest prompted the US to announce that it was suspending \"all non-immigrant visa services at all US diplomatic facilities\" in the country, citing \"recent events\" which have \"forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of the Government of Turkey to the security of US mission facilities and personnel.\" https://www.rt.com/news/406113-turkey-detain-second-us-worker/", "2 4 8 18 20\n1 4 8 15 20\n1 2 4 9 15\n2 6 11 13 17\n1 15 17 18 19\n4 8 9 13 14\n2 5 9 11 12\n5 9 12 15 16\n2 3 12 14 18\n4 14 18 19 20\n6 7 12 13 19\n5 9 10 19 20\n2 7 10 17 19\n2 6 9 11 16\n6 11 15 18 20\n6 7 9 12 14\n8 13 15 16 18\n2 3 4 7 12\n3 4 5 8 13\n4 5 6 11 18\n1 2 12 15 20\n4 7 8 11 20\n1 5 9 16 20\n1 4 7 9 11\n2 5 7 9 11\n1 8 9 12 16\n1 9 10 17 19\n1 2 6 10 16\n6 10 14 15 16\n13 16 18 19 20\n6 10 13 15 18\n2 9 11 12 13\n1 2 3 8 14\n3 7 9 10 16\n2 4 13 14 20\n2 8 10 16 17\n6 10 13 15 20\n3 5 11 18 19\n2 6 8 10 17\n1 4 7 12 15\n6 10 16 19 20\n5 7 9 12 16\n5 6 7 8 19\n2 3 11 18 20\n3 9 10 13 17\n3 7 9 15 19\n3 5 14 15 17\n3 4 7 8 16\n1 6 12 14 20\n4 7 8 12 17\n4 9 10 16 20\n7 11 13 14 18\n2 4 8 9 14\n2 3 7 18 19\n1 2 6 8 10\n1 4 6 9 19\n1 7 8 10 17\n5 8 12 13 18\n4 5 6 11 19\n3 11 12 13 14", ">>144648978\nAs the thread devolved into chaos and we heard nothing else of you I went ahead and baked a true fresh bread with updates, I guess we can use it for backup \n>>144649248\n>>144649248\n>>144649248", "Catalonia\u2019s High Court asks Spanish national police to provide security in case of independence\n\nCatalonia\u2019s High Court has asked for Spanish national police to provide extra security at the court building in case the Catalan parliament goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence, Reuters reported Monday.

Ankara reiterated reciprocally hours later, using similar language.\n\nThe development is unprecedented between the two NATO allies and represents a major fallout in bilateral relations.\n\n>Turkish authorities last week detained Metin Topuz, a Turkish citizen working for the US consulate in Istanbul. He was accused of having links to the organisation of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled religious leader and businessman based in the US and wanted in Turkey. Ankara accuses Gulen of masterminding the July 15 coup attempt that killed more than 300 people.\n\n>Another US consulate employee was called in for questioning by the Istanbul prosecutor's office on Monday as his son and wife were taken into custody in Amasya province. Turkish authorities say that both Metin Topuz and the second unnamed employee have no diplomatic immunity or title.\n\nSeveral US citizens were among the thousands arrested in Turkey after the coup attempt, including American pastor Andrew Brunson.

Syria.\n\nIn a report published on Monday, the Defense Ministry said that since the start of the war on Syria, large amounts of Western-made weapons and ammo were seized in different areas in Syria, and American-made weapons were sighted in the possession of terrorists from ISIS and other terror organizations.\n\nThe Ministry said that these weapons are procured through various channels and via companies in Eastern Europe affiliated with US and NATO intelligence agencies, and then they are delivered to Turkey or Saudi Arabia via European ports of the American Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nThe report pointed out that terrorist from ISIS and Jabhet al-Nusra were provided with rockets, rifles, machineguns, anti-air weapons, and even tanks in exchange for oil that the terrorists steal from wells in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAfter the liberation of east Aleppo and areas in the provinces of Homs, Hama, Aleppo, and Deir Ezzor from ISIS and al-Nusra, the Syrian Arab Army found weapons made in Bulgaria and Eastern European countries that the terrorists left behind, the Ministry added.\n\nThe report also revealed that the Israeli occupation provided various types of weapons to Jabhat al-Nusra and other terror groups in Syria.\n\n>The report said that other channels used to army terrorists in Syria include the support programs for the so-called \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d which were organized by the administration of former US President Barack Obama, and these weapons ended up in the hands of terrorists as evidenced by videos and photos that popped up

Through this \u201cmongrelization,\u201d Jews will precipitate the demise of white, Christian communities, thereby destroying the last vestige of resistance to their assertion of pernicious control.\n\n>Unlike other anti-Semitic memes, there is truth in this observation, though not of course for the reasons that Nazis and white supremacists think. Jews have indeed played disproportionate roles in struggles for racial equality, from the movement against South African apartheid to the cause of civil rights in the United States. And while Jews felt called to these movements by faith, universalistic political commitments, or an innate sense of justice, doing so was also in their communal self-interest. A country that is politically pluralistic, open to new ideas and new people, ethnically diverse, and respectful of religious difference, is a country that will naturally be safer for Jews than a country that is none of these things.

If a person is attracted to another person of the same sex, they cannot reproduce, therefore, the \"playing out\" of traditional man/woman sex acts with that person is wasted effort. If a person is attracted to someone of the same sex, this means that they see something in that person that is worthy of being reproduced, but they know that it cannot happen: it is therefore a sexual paraphilia.\n \n>If a man starts watching porn, and finds himself looking at the penis a little too much, that does not mean he is gay, but society would like to convince him of that. The sight of an erect penis is a sperm competition cue for many men, which goes back to early human days when nudity was more common. In other words, men who like looking at dicks are highly competitive, but get tricked by the society that pushes the gay agenda. Men are more likely to describe the penis using highly descriptive words such as, \"veiny\", \"huge\", \"thick\", etc. It's why even lots of \"straight\" men find pre-op transsexuals visually appealing.\n\nParaphilias have nothing to do with sex, as they have no real biological function. This is why \"homosexuality\" and \"bisexuality\" do not exist in reality. Just because I jerk it to traps, that doesn't mean that I'm not interested in blowing my load in a chick.

Not only are they easier to control, but also look at how urbanised areas vote.\n2) Dependence on civilisation. If you care about your guns so much, you should care about your cars as well.

If you are tall, fair skinned, have a long skull, a straight nose, brown-red-blonde hair, yet have brown eyes, you can still be largely nordic.\n\n\"\"The first is the Nordic or Baltic subspecies. This race is long skulled, very tall, fair skinned, with blond or brown (or red) hair and light colored eyes. The Nordics inhabit the countries around the North and Baltic Seas, and include not only the great Scandinavian and Teutonic groups, but also other early peoples who first appear in southern Europe and in Asia as representatives of Aryan language and culture.\n\nEye color is of very great importance in race determination, because all blue, gray, or green eyes in the world to-day came originally from the same source, namely, the Nordic race of northern Europe. This light colored eye has appeared nowhere else on earth, and is a specialization of this subspecies of man only, and is consequently one of extreme value in the classification of European races. Dark colored eyes are all but universal among wild mammals, and entirely so among the primates, man's nearest relatives.\n\n\u201cOne subspecies of man, and one alone, specialized in light colored eyes. This same subspecies also evolved light or blond hair, a character far less deeply rooted than eye color, as blond children tend to grow darker with advancing years, and populations largely of Nordic extraction, such as those of Lombardy, upon admixture with darker races, lose their blond hair more readily than their light colored eyes.\"\n\nMadison Grant- The Passing of the Great Race", ">>136847603\n>unironically quoting madison grant on racial matters", null, ">>136846894\nThat's quite a list...You know the \"Amerimutt\" thing is largely unfounded, yeah?

Where are places that large groups of people usually converge or stay at for an extended period? Here are 3 categories:\n\nWhere lots of kids meet and stay:\n\nWhere lots of adults meet and stay:\n\nWhere a mix of children and adults meet and stay:\n\nOnce we have determined possibility, we must assess probability. Is it likely that people would be abducted from these areas? Do the traffickers have enough cover to hide behind to get away with abducting people in these areas without too much suspicion? Do these areas have efficient escape routes to where the traffickers can quickly disperse abducted people into trafficking networks or directly to certain locations and people? Lastly, do these areas have enough funding, resources, and number of traffickers with the skills needed to conduct human trafficking operations there?\n\nNext, start looking for connections between people, groups, and already confirmed trafficking networks in these areas. At this step, it is a good idea to bounce around between the midpoints and end points as well to help you find connections.\n\nBreeding grounds are likely not as common as abduction sites and would be harder to figure out, but I think that they are a possibility worth putting on the table.\n\nIf worthwhile connections are found between people and groups that have reasonable probability to be connected to trafficking in that area, then it\u2019s time to move on to connecting that starting point to midpoints and end points in whichever order you choose. You can also start to look for connections between other starting points in the trafficking networks if you think that it will lead to something. Connecting these starting points to the midpoints and the end points will help to further validate them.\n\n>1/3", "Spirit-bump", ">>136205497\nSee your still persistent.", ">>136205519\nMidpoints: Routes, Pit Stops, and Distribution Centers\n\nWhat means of transport are they using to distribute people? What means of transport are available in that location and would be both economically efficient and unsuspicious? Where would those certain means of transport most easily be able to travel to? Where are those certain means of transportation most commonly going?\n\nLook for the places that the transportation is immediately going to. Do not immediately assume that these are ending points, for they may be midpoints (pit stops or distribution centers). See if anything is being transported to and from these locations, for this will determine if it is either a pit stop or a distribution center, and if it is indeed a midpoint. Something to remember about midpoints, and starting points to some extent, is that there are certain resources required for the transport of people (things like food, drugs for sedation, and etc;). Places that distribute these resources work as assets to the networks and may not be used for relocating people.\n\nPit stops will follow along the same route, while distribution centers will branch off into a different one. Pit stops will also generally be smaller than distribution centers and have less access to different routes. Pit stops usually work as refueling stations for the transportation and as temporary lodgings. Pits stops in-between distribution centers and end points are important for maintaining a state of confidentiality, as people would start noticing if the routes all directly went to just one place.\n\nDistribution centers are usually a warehouse, a fulfillment center, a cross-dock facility, a bulk break center, or a package handling center. This is where people are sold and transported to their respective ending points. These are especially required to remain hidden or non-suspect, and must be large enough to accommodate for large groups of people.\n\n>2/3", ">>136205519\n>>136205602\nEnd Points: Individuals, Locations, and Organizations\n\nWho are the ones receiving all of these people in the end? It can either be individuals who are looking for personal sex slaves or for people to use as sacrifices. \n\nThey can be specific locations which function as a type of Bohemian Grove or for places where they conduct orgies, mass torture, cannibalism (Spirit Cooking comes to mind, along with Spirit Eating), or group sacrifices. Group indoctrination, hazing ceremonies, and blackmail can also occur at these places.\n\nOther locations include military bases, labs, and secret underground bases for genetic experiments, cloning, and for Super Soldier programs. Since some of these locations are top secret it may not be possible to find them, but you can find the trafficking networks that ultimately go to them. Locations like these are also likely to be tied to various groups.\n\nGroups are numerous and varied. Examples are big pharma companies, bio-tech companies, IRL umbrella corporations, and large-scale cults and globalist groups. These groups can conduct any mixture of the previously mentioned activities that require people from human trafficking. These ending points in of themselves would have their own connections within them to different groups and individuals. The \u201cend product\u201d that these groups produce from the people they get through human trafficking may also be relocated and distributed to different places and organizations.\n\nGuessing certain end points and seeing if the starting and midpoints happen to go to them, or are within the proximity of them, can be a valid strategy for finding them out.\n\n>3/3", "Look for these kinds of things to map out the trafficking networks (courtesy of Anon5):\n\n1) [Secret Compartments in Vehicles/Ships/Aircraft & Types of Transport](Vans, Semi-Trucks, Buses, Trains etc for Land, Yachts, Cruise Ships, Container/Cargo Ships, Ferry's etc for Sea, Private Jets, Commercial/Cargo Flights, etc for Air.)(Sewers & Subway Tunnels can also be used). \n\n2) [Abandoned Large Buildings in/around Sanctuary Cities.](Big enough to act as Distribution Centers/Warehouses for Trafficking Networks(Weapons, Drugs, People, Body parts/remains, etc))\n\n3) [2016 Election District Map's Blue Parts](In relation to Trafficking Routes, Sanctuary Cities, etc. Work on combining different Maps to see the full picture/patterns.)\n\nPedo's are not the only groups the Kids are going to & Trafficking has several different categories:\n\n1) [Government]\n\n(For things like Super Soldier programs, Cloning & Body Modifications)\n\n2) [Corporation/Business]\n\n(For things like Genetic Testing/Experimentation & Chimera's)\n\n3) [Criminal]\n\n(Drugs, Weapons, Sex Slaves & Children)\n\n4) [Cult] \n\n(Sacrifices, Blackmail & Indoctrination)\n\n5) [Intel Agencies]\n\n(Brainwashing for Spy/Informant programs & Special Agent operations)\n\n6) [Breeding/Harvesting Farms]\n\n(Selectively Bred/Produced Humans, Organs/Fetuses/Blood & Supplying Trafficking Networks/Centers)\n\n7) [Hollywood]\n\n(Truman Show breeding/handling operations.)\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of trafficking for organ harvesting and slave labor (think Qatar for instance).", ">>136205558\nBut it's real awoo hours, so I'll take a step back.", "bumping for crowd sourced justice", "Frank said mossad tried to save the USA from 9/11", "Reminder that is the area that we've outlined to find the main distribution center in LA.

This is based on evidence that these laws often make sex workers less safe and provide impunity for abusers with sex workers often too scared of being penalized to report crime to the police.

TIME reports,\n\n>\"Dart only has jurisdiction in Cook County, but he\u2019s encouraging officers from all over the country to try the buyer-focused approach.

[\u2026]\n\n>\u201cSome human rights groups take issue with this approach. On August 11 [2015], Amnesty International voted to recommend the complete decriminalization of prostitution, both for the buyers and sellers, saying that criminal laws against the consensual adult sex trade violates the human rights of sex workers. While UNAIDS and the World Health Organization have previously called for the decriminalization of sex work for public health reasons (in order to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases), and other groups have advocated the same, Amnesty International is the first major international human rights group to issue a full-throated global public policy recommendation for lifting laws against buying and selling of sex purely on humans rights grounds.

Their attacks don't have any impact on us because they are not respecting our points of view. We're not taken seriously from the start. THEY however take their issues very seriously, and any joke about them is indeed an attack, and it's funny because it is unexpected (pretty much every punchline is chaos incarnated, it plays with expectations and derails them). \n\nThe left can only \"win\" if they take conservative/far-right points of view seriously (and I don't mean as in an attack, but as a valid point of view). They'd have to normalize it in order to joke about it and put it down - they can't put us down because we're never up. Also they'd have to accept our attacks on them and embrace them instead of rejecting them. \nSo, in short, in order to \"win\", they'd have to give up their current social dominance, which would be a cultural loss (and win for our views).\n\nTruly \"won\" can the meme wars be only by those who are down and oppressed, so the left would have to essentially switch our positions.

Ball suffered badly from Chamberlain's fall and death later in 1940; he wound up serving in that Security Executive position for two years, until 1942.[8]\n\nFrom the mid-1930s into the early 1940s, Ball played a key role in secret direction and control of the weekly newspaper Truth, a pro-fascist publication.[9] This paper attacked Leslie Hore Belisha, the only Jewish cabinet minister, forcing his resignation in 1940.\nLater years, legacy\nBall later joined the South African and Rhodesian gold mining group Lonrho, which had been founded in 1909. He assumed a leadership role, and brought in Tiny Rowland in 1961, shortly before his own death, to run that company.

The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization. Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It's what's known as `the law of the market'. In an economic system where unfair dismissal is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their place. In a sexual system where adultery is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their bed mate. In a totally liberal sexual system certain people have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude. Economic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. Sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. On the economic plane Raphael Tisserand belongs in the victors' camp; on the sexual plane in that of the vanquished. Certain people win on both levels; others lose on both. Businesses fight over certain young professionals; women fight over certain young men; men fight over certain young women; the trouble and strife are considerable.\" Whatever (Houellebecq)\n\nCharacter in the book is Jewish.

When a narcissist looks into the mirror of self (which is the absence of a known self) he sees reflected back who and what others are or are not, this causes the narcissist to re-live the learned helplessness of past real or perceived victimization. With his True Self dissociated or disconnected he feels abandoned, rejected, invalidated, and drowning in alienated loneliness, and he turns to his rage in order to intimidate and control others in ways that attempt to mitigate his own pain and his own responsibility for that pain (Mahari). Unfortunately, when the narcissists rage, they violate the rights and trust of others, confused and upset, the object of their love begins to move away from them. This sends them further into a rage because their whole identity requires attention in order to survive. Their rage reaches it height, and they want to kill off the source of their pain, this they do in a number of ways, which will generally end in a character assassination of the person.

When this admiration is blocked, for example by questioning a decision made by the narcissist, narcissistic rage can set in. Symptoms of rage may be mild and non-violent, such as displaying visible irritation, vocal disagreement with the situation or head-shaking. More severe symptoms of narcissistic rage include outburst of physical violence, directed at both objects and people, and vocal outrage. In general, a person that frequently displays narcissistic rage symptoms is often labeled as selfish, spoiled and a sore loser by their peers. Unlike regular anger, narcissistic rage is unwarranted and is caused by neutral events that will not provoke reactions in non-narcissists. Persistent episodes of narcissistic rage may result in the perpetuation of rage cycles: patterns of rage behavior that frequently repeat day after day. Others experience infrequent burst of rage that can vary in severity depending on the event in question. In some cases malignant narcissism may be present.

By 1995 it had evolved into the first major public website dedicated to promoting white supremacy, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. But online hate speech mostly remained confined to its traditional base of neo-Nazis and Klansmen until the launch in 2003 of 4chan. Originally conceived as an anonymous message board for discussing Japanese anime and manga, 4chan attracted a cult following among techies at around the same time that its political discussion board, now known as /pol/ (short for \"politically incorrect\"), became a hotbed for racist jokes and ironically intended Hitler memes.\n\nThe political glue binding the predominately young, male 4chan community is essentially anti-leftist: a disdain for identity politics and so-called \"social justice warriors.\" This attitude thrives amid a culture of anonymity, in which status ostensibly comes from pageviews rather than one's gender, ethnic, or social background. \"Larry,\" a software engineer for Google and alt-right fan, points to the infamous 4chan post, \"There are no girls on the internet,\" where one 4channer profanely lectures another about how online life is a meritocracy in which gender should play no role.\n\nYet, hostility towards women and people of color thrives on 4chan and on Reddit, the social sharing site whose political and gaming forums /r/the_donald and /r/kotakuinaction are popular with the alt-right. In 2014, 4chan and Reddit users launched an elaborate campaign of rape and death threats against female video game developers that became known as Gamergate."}, "replies": [">>116156996\nThey found champions in Yiannopoulos, who argued that the true victims were the men whose gaming culture was being destroyed by \"feminist bullies\" and the \"achingly politically correct\" tech press, and in Mike Cernovich, a blogger who has trumpeted the neuroticism and other alleged weaknesses of women as well as what he claims to be the criminal proclivities of certain ethnic groups. When former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao last year banned five \"harassing subreddits,\" including one called ShitNiggersSay, the move unleashed weeks of bigoted trolling (a.k.a. \"shitposting\") and digital vandalism on the site\u2014and a migration to a Reddit copycat site, Voat. (More recently, similar migrations took place after Reddit banned /r/altright and discussion of the fake-news scandal #PizzaGate.)\n\nThe anonymity of 4chan and Reddit make it impossible to tell to what extent they are dominated by tech workers, though an abiding interest from the tech press suggests considerable overlap. \"It's definitely geek culture,\" says McGill University cultural anthropologist Gabriella Coleman, who has studied how 4chan gave rise to the hactivist group Anonymous. \"Clint,\" a Valley cybersecurity startup founder and long-time visitor to the site, told me that the majority of active users on 4chan/pol/ are in tech, though typically in lower-level system administrator and tech support jobs that come with a lot of downtime during the workday. Dale Beran, who recently wrote about the political history of 4chan, argues that techies have become less dominant as 4chan and similar sites have expanded, though they still play a role: \"We can define [4chan users] by their retreat into the computer, which means a lot of them have computer skills\u2014whether that's networking or coding or whatever\u2014but to some it may have simply been World of Warcraft.\"", ">>116157019\nBefore Gamergate, Larry, the Google software engineer, was \"a standard Democrat straight-voting person,\" as he puts it. But reading about the movement in the tech press and on pro-Gamergate websites \"did highlight some of the inconsistencies and hypocrisies with positions on the left,\" he says. A comment in a Gamergate thread led Larry to the Unz Review, a website run by Palo Alto tech entrepreneur and former GOP gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz. There, Larry says he was exposed to treatises on \"human biological diversity\" expounding on the supposed cognitive differences between intellectually superior and inferior races.\n\nHuman biological diversity has also gained currency in the Valley through computer scientist Curtis Yarvin, who writes under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug. Starting in 2007, in series of blog posts often cited by alt-right followers, Yarvin laid out a political philosophy known as neoreaction or the \"Dark Enlightenment.\" Combining a technocratic sensibility with reactionary political thought, neoreaction rejects Enlightenment concepts\u2014such as democracy and equality of the races and sexes\u2014and instead advocates something much closer to authoritarianism. Yarvin believes government would work much better if run like a tech company and helmed by an all-powerful CEO president. He spoke admiringly of Napoleon, whom he considers to be \"kind of the Steve Jobs of France.\"\n\nYarvin's blog combines dorky programmer lingo with dense references to obscure, proto-fascist political texts. \"When I started blogging 10 years ago, the availability of completely unorthodox written content [online] was mostly confined to the pre-1923 corpus, which Google did such a nice job scanning,\" Yarvin told me in an email. He believes that software programmers are attracted to his writings because they \"are always looking for something to do with their restless, fidgety brains.

Lolicon is a portmanteau of \"Lolita complex,\" a Japanese expression meaning pedophile attracted to underage girls. The alternate is shotacon, which is the same but with underage boys. Many anime fans call themselves lolicons and masturbate to lolicon anime and manga under the assumption that it isn't child porn. Many non-hentai anime even feature children with erotic undertones. The popular Monogatari franchise is an example; they started with one \"loli\" character, and her popularity led to them introducing more similar characters and increasing the sexual undertones surrounding those characters. The randoseru, a backpack used by Japanese elementary school children, has been adopted by the anime community as a symbol of lolicon and a sexual symbol. They often argue that it's just anime, and not real, but as studies have shown, pornography leads to the development of new fetishes and subconsciously promotes sexual aggression and promiscuity, so the hentai IS changing them, regardless of if they believe it or not.", ">>115510735\nGood, most anime betafags are pedo losers and need to be gassed", ">>115512989\n\nKnJ was written by a woman who claims it's loosely related on real events.

If there was a revolution in the US, the rest of the world would get involved, fast. Depending on the type of uprising, there is a large chance that it would not be a quick affair. It would be brutal, it would be bloody, and the US government could start a global scale war. Here are the top ten issues that came up.\n1) The US power grid can be taken down by a series of \u201csurgical strikes\u201d with the exception of the Texas grid. By surgical strikes, I mean a few marksmen (US army-tier Marksmen\u2013the minimum requirement) hitting certain spots on the grid would fuck a lot of the military and government because they need the grid more than Bubba and his friends do. Additionally, while all government agencies have backup generators, they will be hard pressed dealing with the resultant looting and other madness that would come with power outages. This would effectively create another front for the military. It would also turn the people against the government more quickly and paralyze the government\u2019s propaganda machine. Worse still\u2013the key points of the US power grid are publicly obtainable information, and not only are the points too many to be effectively guarded, they are not guarded anyway.", ">>110976506\nJust fucking try.

The remaining (treasonous) military would be fighting its own. Yet another front created in the war. Additionally, there is an assumed 25-50% desertion or outright betrayal rate in three letter government agencies (FBI, CIA, NSA, ATC, TSA, etc.). Additionally, it is assumed that 5% of the initial 50% betrayers would stay in their job and become saboteurs. 10% of that 50% would contain key information that would be of critical danger to the US government. Of that 10%, 1% would be able to deliver that information to the US\u2019 foreign enemies. What you should get from this is that the second the United States government declares war on its own is the second it ceases to exist as the state we know it.\n3) \u201cTea baggers,\u201d \u201cright-wing extremists,\u201d and \u201coath keepers\u201d which are considered untrained racists who aren\u2019t \u201cgood with a gun\u201d often are A) veterans who now have more time to have fun at the range, sometimes more than some Army units or Marine units. In addition to previous military training, B) often camp and do other outdoor activities\u2013more than many in the military do, as the focus has gone away from field exercises, and C) often have better equipment\u2013outside of armor and heavy weapons\u2013than the military. However, C) is kind of irrelevant because many of the places in which these people could hide would make the kind of war the US fights with the equipment they use pointless.", ">>110980843\n4) Outside influence is a huge problem. Russia has already stated they would back a Texas separatist movement, and right now we already have enough problem keeping Islam in check. The second the US has to fight in a \u201ccivil war\u201d is the second it becomes a proxy war between NATO and whoever wants to mess with America. While America has amazing nuclear and air defense, if it comes to a civil war you have to assume that in a best cast scenario the US military is going to be operating at 50% capacity at best. Shit would go down. Hard. And fast. And if Russia\u2013spoiler alert: one of the best militaries in the world at fighting in an urban environment\u2013sent trainers and helpers to rebels, you can reliably bet that they would also possibly deliver weapons to them. So instead of fighting \u201cTimmy TeaBagger,\u201d you are fighting \u201cTimmy TeaBagger who is buddies with Vlad.\u201d\n5) A civil war is not just the US versus the rebels. There will be looting. There will be rioting. Cities will burn. The National Guard cannot fight both the rebels and rioters in a city that would also cut off their supplies. Additionally, if you don\u2019t think that the rebels will send in instigators into the cities\u2013or worse, stand alone actors (A Lone Wolf on steroids. Think Timothy McVeigh, but instead of one van they have a whole fleet of them. A good movie example would be Bane)\u2013you would be mistaken. If the US government cannot even help its own people, why would its own people support the remaining (treasonous) military? Worse yet, if someone emptied out prisons (There are more prisoners in the US than there are people in the entire Chinese Army), you would have more crime than the police could ever handle.", ">>110980888\n6) Logistics and infrastructure in the US are crumbling and failing. Any war fought against a rebellion in the US would be a logistical nightmare, even before the rebels started going full Al-Qaida and putting IEDs in the road. A retired general who was contracting with us on the team said, \u201cThe only thing holding together the US\u2019 infrastructure is duct tape and the will of the Department of Transportation. And often enough, there isn't enough duct tape.\u201d Your most loyal cities to the US government, as we polled, are also the most logistically easy to cut off. NYC? San Fran? L.A.? D.C.? Baltimore? Most of them require crossing water to enter, from certain directions. Most of them have critical airports. Some of them have critical ocean ports. If anything happened to just TWO of the cities on the list, it would create a logistical clusterfuck.\n7) Your \u201cJohnny Reb\u201d and \u201cTimmy TeaBagger\u201d states (i.e., \u201cred\u201d states) all have something most of your \u201coh so progressive,\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we so European,\u201d \u201cOh my god, we are just like Sweden,\u201d blue states don\u2019t. Blues are mainly consumer states. Reds are producer states. Urban areas don\u2019t have farms. The second that shit goes down, realize a lot of those blue areas are likely to starve. In a civil war scenario, we predicted that at least 10,000 people would die of starvation if the war was not finished in a year. The numbers get worse after that. Or better, rather, for the country after the war.", ">>110980952\n8) The US has way too many choke points, and the government forces would often be on the wrong side of them. This ties into the logistical nightmare, but it also has to do with an odd phenomena. Liberals like to live near the ocean. Many of the dividers of the country, like the Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, Appalachia, the Missouri River (fun fact: the biggest choke point for the US government is in Missouri) are red state areas. Sure, air travel is a thing, but a majority of the US government's needs would have to travel by ground. Even still, many of the major airports are outside of the city. Of course, the US would use military base air fields, but if civil war did break out\u2026 which bases would be safe? Which ones would have fallen to the deserters?\n9) PR Nightmare. Every rebel killed on CNN would be spun as \u201cthe US government killed X Civilians today in a strike\u201d on foreign news and pirate media not owned by the government. That is\u2013as pointed out earlier\u2013if the US media could even function in a civil war or uprising. Your \u201crebel scum\u201d know that the main thing that holds together the US\u2013nay life in the US as we know it\u2013is the 24 hour news cycle and the media. The second it's gone, you are going to have urban anarchy. If you are from America, can you imagine a day without TV, newspaper, or Internet? Your average urban youth can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t think that isn\u2019t going to cause rioting, you must have a real high regard for how much restraint they have. Assume in a civil war that your ability to talk to the people is compromised. Also assume that in the case of a civil war that rebels may know how to monitor conversations like the US does, as there are manuals online on how to do so.", ">>110980981\n10) This one is either 1 or 10, depending on who is asked. The US will never nuke its own. The second it does, they have lost the civil war and other countries will come to \u201cliberate\u201d the US from its own \u201crepressive regime.\u201d Additionally, if any general, minuteman, nuke tech, or nuke sub captain decided to side with the rebellion, the US government is immediately SOL.\nIn short: The second that a \u201ccivilian uprising\u201d or \u201cextremist group terrorist attack\u201d turns into \u201ccivil war\u201d is the second the US loses. As a result, you will never see a civil war. You will see Waco, you will see Bundy Ranch, you will see all sorts of militant group confrontations and maybe even some skirmishes. But the US government fears its own people way the fuck too much to ever start a civil war.\nAs an American, I want all other Americans here to remember this. The government is against you, almost openly now, but they also know that they cannot win if it comes to open war. We have a trump card they cannot match. If it comes to a fight, THEY WILL LOSE, so there are elements in the establishment who will do absolutely everything in their power to prevent it from coming to that. The US Government is not in support of its people, and the people are not in support of the government.\nIt is within the means of certain interests to start World War III simply as a distraction to avoid an American Civil War, because, by their reckoning, it is better to ruin other \u201clesser\u201d nations like Syria and spill the blood of patriots than lose their own grip on power.", ">>110973735\n>I work for a major think tank\nno you don't you fucking liar.", ">>110973735\nNice roleplay", ">>110976506\nAll you had to do was bide your time, and grow your political base.

Its basis is demographics caused by the baby boom/bust. We cycle between left and right philosophy in this cycle. The left is \"emotion > logic\", the right is \"logic > emotion\". when society is younger it is more left due to lack of experience, when society is older it is more right due to experience. Women are more left because they have less neurons in the cerebral cortex than men. Women voting swings society more left.\nWhen the baby boom causes a subsequent economy boom governments collect more tax and get more in debt because they assume every economic problem is fixed and past problems wont return. The boom creates wealth and the faith in wealth protecting their old age stops dependency on children as a safety net for old age. Contraception and abortion etc rises.\nThe lack of children causes economic decline. Governments \"solve\" this with immigration. The continual economic decline increases immigration until it disrupts society. Tensions rise, international tensions rise as countries fight over debt, dwindling markets and resources.

He desired for families, business owners, Entrepreneurs, and the like to work less for the government and more for themselves. He believed that true success is achieved through perseverance, claiming that many men have genius and talent, but too often fall short in their struggles of life because they simply lack the will to persevere through times of discomforting doubt and pain.\n\nHe was a patriot, caring not for the interests of other countries but only his own. He was a man who believed as the founding fathers did, isolationist as diplomacy, but globalist as economy. The deregulation of the American economy during his time prospered in a boom in the stock market, GDP, and wealth for all american peoples. The steady plan of free market growth would be planted in the redeeming years of the start of the great roaring twenties.\n\nLastly, he was a man that understood equality as well as racial pride. He advocated for women's rights as well as frowning upon discrimination of Africans in his country. He valued the homogeneity of his great nation and passed acts to prohibit the immigration of corrupt and different peoples from dark corners of the world.\n\nIn short, a great man who's ideology will be framed and put upon the wall of patriotism as a shining tribute to freedom, prosperity, and pride that will stand out among the many others that have been so honored to hold the most supreme power of this great nation.", ">>107237700\n>>107237717\n\nWe Geolibertarians distinguish ourselves from right-wing, \"royal\" libertarians by our profound respect for the principle that one has private property in the fruits of one's labor. This includes the fruits of mental labor and the results of reinvestment of legitimate private property (capital) in future production. We remain consistent in that respect by recognizing, as did the classic liberals, that land and raw natural resources are not the fruits of labor, but a common heritage to be accessed on terms that are equal under the law for everyone. The statist system of land tenure empowers non-producing landlords to extract the fruits of tenants' labor.\nWe also consider ourselves \"green\" in our respect for the earth as our common heritage. However, we clearly distinguish between land as common property and land as state property. Unlike left-wing or \"watermelon\" greens, we advocate governance of land in harmony with free market principles, and deny the right of statist bureaucracies to meddle in the affairs of individual land holders. We see ourselves as embracing the best attributes of the Green and Libertarian parties.\n\nGeolibertarians also believe in free trade, with no state support for monopoly privileges of any kind. We therefore oppose money monopolies, information monopolies, a host of lesser monopolies, and most of all, monopoly of the power to govern, as embodied by statist political systems. We are not nihilistic anarchists. We believe that monopoly privileges can be gently and methodically displaced without disrupting to society, even when statists resort to violence to prevent it.", ">>107238449\nBest stock market performance of any president ever.

And for how long can one make that claim?\n\nAccording to classical liberals, land belonged to the user for as long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to the earth at all?
