Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia were reporting almost 100 per cent insistence that the prisoners be sent home. But there were odd pockets of support for the President. He might have thought that Russia, after her humiliation in the Cold War, would take the chance to put her boot on the neck of the old adversary. But no, the Russians had their problems with Islamic terror.

He also gained a doctorate in political science in 1922. For a time, he worked in a textile factory run by a Kike, but regularly donated to the SA with funds embezzled from the Kike, repatriating some of the wealth that the Kike stole from honest Germans. Due to Kike manipulation, he was blacklisted from employment and had his doctorate revoked. Lastly, he fought in the Spanish Foreign Legion during the Spanish Civil War, which is where Gottlob Berger recognized him as the impressive man that he is and even helped remove his blacklisting and restore his doctorate.\nDuring WW2 he was the leader of the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, that would later be nicknamed the \"Dirlewanger Brigade\" in his honor, formed from reformed poachers. His main activity was anti-partisan and commanding a labour camp. The judge (((Georg Konrad Morgen))) tried to end Dirlewanger but failed and was rightfully demoted and sent to the Eastern Front. He and his unit were later assigned to anti-bandit operation in Belarus where his achievements were recognized with a German Cross in Gold. He was reported as having slain 14,000 bandits. He then fought in the Warsaw uprising of 1944 and where he was promoted to the rank of SS-Oberfuhrer and earned his Knight's Cross. He then fought in the Slovak National Uprising.\nHe was killed by the (((Allies))) who after imprisoning him, had him brutally beaten to death without trial.", ">>232948448\nLets look at the military awards that Basedwanger earned during his time in the German Army:\n>1915 Eisernes Kreuz II.

Analog voice is converted via codec to a digital stream, which is then routed through a repeater and out somewhere else on the planet. For example, Wyoming, USA to Yokosuka, Japan.\n>What is a repeater\nA repeater takes your radio\u2019s transmission, amplifies it from a more topographically-sound location, effectively increasing the range of your handheld up to 100mi.\n\nNewbies, feel free to post questions, we're here to help."}, "replies": [">>232556720\nbump", ">But ham radio is for boomers\nNo it isn't, starting at 20$ you can get yourself an SDR and monitor a significant portion of the radio bands, including police and emergency services.\n\nFor 25$ you can get a cheap chink radio that is easy to use and will prove to be essential for your bug-out bag when needs be.", ">But that means I need to register take an exam and register my name and address with the guberment\nNo it doesn't.

In SHTF and if the government ever collapses, there would be no rules.

Short story is you would have to heavily modify the transceivers and even then it's just a mitigation and you would still be detectable, it would just be harder to detect or pinpoint your transmissions. But it might be even more dangerous than just transmitting without a loicense because spread spectrum means it would be more likely you would be possibly stepping on other users of the spectrum (either hams or the military depending on how broad and what freqs you use), and thus you would be even more likely to be denounced to the FCC or v&.\nPlay all you want with SDR receivers but radio transmissions are just impossible to hide. If you must transmit illegally then stick to low power and if possible do it from a car.\nAnother cool way of exchanging information is physically exchanging usb sticks and similar and it's how Cubans do it since Internet is so hard to get over there.

You need to maintain your anonymity. At first this might make you feel like you're a criminal or doing something wrong but this is false. As long as you don't vandalize anything you are well within the law and your 1A rights. And if stating that it's okay for a race of people to exist is \"wrong\", then what is the correct opinion? That they shouldn't exist? Take heart: you undeniably have the moral and legal high ground here. But once you do something effective that goes against the liberal narrative they will try to attack you with everything they have. Leftists are, quite frankly, violent totalitarian lunatics. Look what they did to Nick Sandmann just for smiling. His school received bomb threats after MSM sicced a lynch mob on a child. What do you think they would do to you? I have [a smear article written about me on the ADL because of my poster campaigns](https://archive.fo/LiDzq), thankfully they were unable to determine my real identity. But I don't want anything like that happening to you.\n\n2. That being said, do not be scared away from exercising your 1A rights by liberal tyranny. But be smart about it. This is exactly why the campaign is planned on Halloween. It's the one night where you can wander around at night with a costume on without arousing suspicion. Choose a costume with a mask that [covers your face](https://magaimg.net/img/6lj5.jpg). It's best to choose where you will put posters ahead of time, plan your route and even practice walking through it beforehand.", "3. You can tape up or staple posters to public and campus bulletin boards, telephone poles, etc. but please respect local bylaws. You can also use smaller posters that can be more discreet to carry and deploy. Instead of an 8.5x11 piece of printer paper, you can print out a [2x2 pattern](https://magaimg.net/img/8zg6.jpg) and cut them out, or you can go [even smaller](https://magaimg.net/img/8zg7.jpg). Now they might fit up a loose sleeve, and fit on surfaces that larger ones can't. You can get creative and cheeky with your poster / flyer deployment (within the law). For example, try placing your poster directly over top of some leftie propaganda on a public bulletin board. They hate that.\n\n4. Be aware of your surroundings while putting up posters. Keep your posters concealed until you are putting them up (for example keep them in a trick-or-treat bag or up your sleeve if they fit). NEVER deploy a poster without checking your surroundings for deranged leftists first. Be aware of blind spots and blind turns where people might appear suddenly. It's even better if you can do this with a friend who can watch your back while you put them up. If you hold the poster and your friend tapes / staples it makes deployment faster too. And leftie lunatics are less likely to approach a group of two or more people (they are cowards when not behind their keyboards).", "5. This next one is an extremely rare risk but it still needs to be mentioned. If anyone does approach you while you're putting up posters, calmly walk away and do not respond to them. If they follow you, call the police and tell them someone is threatening you and following you. Make sure the angry little leftie totalitarian following you clearly hears the police call (this is usually enough to scare them off). DO NOT engage them in any way. [Here is a perfect example](https://magaimg.net/img/6m2f.jpg) of poster activists ignoring and escaping some left wing creep who tried to follow them (and another one who called the police about the posters but was told no crime was being committed lol). Be like these guys, be smart. Liberals are cowards and physically weak so they pose little physical threat but if one decided to try and punch you just escape the situation. Do not fight back even if you have the legal right to self defense. The courts are horribly corrupt in most places (sad to say). It's better to get away than be dragged through a kangaroo court with a liberal judge and jury even if you win in the end. It's not worth the headache, cost and effort. Be smart and tactical about this. But again this is an extremely low risk so don't let it worry you; don't let liberal tyranny win.\n\nIf you're excited - and if I haven't scared you off yet - then welcome aboard the IOTBW 2019 campaign! Be proud to be part of the third year of a highly successful poster campaign that is defying left wing censorship and racism in an effective and amusing way. To all who heed the call: thank you for your service!

They should have really driven home the darker side of Gem civilization; with all the singing and positivity you really lose sense of the fact that Gems are genocidal, tyrannical, and brutal.

Steven is very effeminate and conflict-averse, but displays leadership and meditation skills when pushed to do so. In many ways he is more mature than the hysterical beings thousands of years his senior.

And how that bonding forms a new being, it\u2019s kinda like how you notice that you have certain mannerism, language, and behavior when you are hanging out with a close friend or loved one that you don\u2019t share with other people. The problem is Rebecca is an idiot and she\u2019s all over the place with this concept. Yes the show shits on men, but that\u2019s mainly the town shit which you can skip.

And while other characters are developed over the course of the show, only Steven is shown to experience this kind of actual *growth*. Steven comes to exemplify self sacrifice, restraint, resolve, and becomes the character that everyone depends on to actually progress the story. These are predominantly masculine character traits, which are not so crude as to always rely on brute force. We see from the movie that Steven is fucking stupidly strong and could easily solve every problem with overwhelming force, but he restrains himself to pursue more peaceful methods despite being the strongest person in the room.

For example, Ebola is quite deadly, but it's actually pretty hard to spread due to needing direct blood contact.\n\nSo what would happen if you combined ebola with say, a common flu? With sufficiently advanced engineering, you could have an ebola that initially only presents as a standard flu for the first 1-2 weeks. People would continue to take flights, go to work etc thinking it was just a relatively harmless flu.\n\nThen two weeks later you'd have massive \"mysterious\" outbreaks of Ebola all across the world.

Basically a \"fuck you, world\" kind of weapon.\n\nIf certain dissidents are to be believed, this weapon has been produced, likely still exists, and may have even been used at some point.\n\nThe key feature of the virus is the incubation period. The claim is they extended the incubation period of a certain highly lethal virus to not days, or weeks, but possibly a decade or more.\n\nDuring this extended incubation, the number of virus particles is low enough that it shows zero symptoms, and it would be undetectable unless you were actually looking for it. While transmission rates would be quite low, over the course of a couple years it should be able to easily spread throughout an entire population. A literal 100% rate of infection.\n\nNow this has been known about in the virology community for a while. One of those intriguing campfire stories we would tell each other after one too many drinks at the hotel lobby.\n\nWell one group had the idea of testing this. Is there a latent and highly lethal virus lying dormant in the population?\n\nThey took blood samples from people across the US as well as some Western European countries and discovered something quite disturbing. A mysterious virus, referred to internally as \"pathogen X\" present in something like 95% of the samples.\n\nIt's an unusually large virus with a very particular shape, like a large toroid with spiky protruberances along the central axis.\n\nThe genome is HUGE, and that makes knowing its actual payload at this stage almost impossible. It shares significant similarities with smallpox, lassa, influenza, and HIV, but it neither looks nor behaves like any of these.\n\nSo the conclusion at this point is an uncomfortable one.

We may be able to decrease the viral count extremely low using standard therapies, but the concern is that during the active phase it will undergo massive amplification in just a few days so it won't really matter how few virus particles are present.\n\nThe other idea is to create a vaccination against the active phase. But that would require activating the virus, and it's not clear it even has an active phrase (it may remain in the dormant phase permanently), and if it does have an active phase, what exactly triggers that is unknown.\n\nBut in theory, if we had the active form of the virus we could begin developing a vaccine very quickly.

He created the waters of the Earth and the waters of the Firmament. He created all the lands with their valleys and their mountains. He created all the fish of the sea and the birds of the air. He created all creatures that crawl and slither. He created all creatures that walk on four legs and two. He then created Man in his Image and named him Adam (Ruddy cheeks, the man who Blushes, the White man.)\n \nMan disobeyed God and was exiled from Eden. After many generations the peoples of the Earth became degenerated and had mixed with the Jotnar/Nephilim. There was only one good Man left, and he was named Noah of Atlantis. Atlantis was located in Doggerland, and when God flooded the world in the Younger Dryas event, Atlantis went below the waves. Noah gathered up two of every animal (including the negroid, mongoloid, australoid, and injun) and drifted in his Ark for 40 days and nights. At last he reached dry land on Mount Ararat in the southern Caucasses, and his people thereafter became known as Caucasians. He released all the animals of the earth to go and dwell where they belong, including the human-like animals.\n \nHam, son of Noah, dishonored his father and became depraved. His people would go on to become neolithic farmers. But Shem and Japheth did not dishonor their father. The Bible says:\n \nBlessed be the LORD, the God of Shem!\n \nMay Canaan be the servant of Shem.\n \n27May God EXPAND THE TERRITORY OF JAPHETH\n \nmay he dwell in the tents of Shem,\n \nand may Canaan be his servant.\u201d\n \nAnd so it was that the Japhethites would inherit vast lands.", "SECTION TWO - THE EXODUS\n \nThe Caucasian people went on to inhabit the middle east, but the Shemites had mixed with canaanites and negroes and become corrupted. They became the Egyptians, with the knowledge they had of God decaying very rapidly. Thousands of years later Plato would notice this connection, however for now we will look at the first Revolution.\n \nThe Shemites came to oppress their Japhethite brothers, now called Israelites. So God had Moses lead them away from the Pharoe of Egypt and to the lands to the north. They conquered these lands from the canaanite farmers and dwelled there for many years. In Syria some of them mixed again with the already mixed Shemites again, destroying the blue-eyed character of that area and dooming it to lose its prosperity.\n \nThe shemites, angry at their cousins for being superior, formed Babylon and enslaved the Israelite people, deporting them to north of the Caucasses.", "SECTION THREE - THE ARYANS\n \nThe Israelite people then split up into many tribes, the eldest among them the Scythians, and invaded the canaanite farmers of the west. This was the beginning of Europe. After conquering the canaanite farmers the Israelite Aryans became several distinct peoples, but the truest to their identity were the Celts (Gelts.) They spread from Albion in the west to Scythia in the east, and many even returned to their ancient lands in Anatolia and the levant. By now the Shemites had also become Pheonicians and colonized North Africa. The Israelites first began warring against eachother in Troy, bringing about a dark age.", "SECTION FOUR - JESUS, THE SUN KING\n \nThe Israelite people remembered their past, with Wodan/Godan being the Allmighty Allfather who had won them many battles against the canaanite farmers. They remembered Michael the Thunderer, who slew many nephilim/Jotnar including the dragon Jormungandr-Leviathan. They remembered THE LORD, Whose love gave them harvests and who would come in the clouds to save them at their darkest hour. Known by the names Arthur, Kalki, Barbarossa, and His most important incarnation, Jesus.\n \nJesus was sent to Gaulillee by his father the Almighty God to end the degeneracy and brother killing that had infected the Israelite people. He commanded the Israelites to cease fighting amongst eachother and return to their roots. The Shemites were terrified at the thought of Japheth reuniting, so they killed Jesus in a mocking manner, hanging him upon the Cross (The Sun-wheel.)", "SECTION FIVE - SHEMITE INFILTRATION\n \nSo the word of Jesus, King of the Aryans was spread throughout Europe. Even the savage Germanics freed themselves from the worship of demons and returned to God. Charlemagne built a mighty empire attempting to unite all the Israelite peoples, and fending off those who still worshipped demons disguising themselves as Godan, The Thunderer, and the Lord.\n \nThe land of England, ancient home of the Caucasian race, became the target of utmost hatred by the Shemites, now falsely calling themselves by the name of the tribe of Judah. These Jews infiltrated the Church and corrupted it. By the 16th century Isaac's Sons could stand it no longer and broke away. The jews were furious, and used the money they had gained through Usury to finance Pharoe Cromwell, who revolted against the Righteous House of Stuart (the line of Good King James who commissioned the most Holy and Uncorrupted version of the Bible ever written.) They fought nobly against the jewish Commonwealth and eventually it collapsed. The jews would soon try again by inviting a Dutchman, a once noble people who had been reduced to greedy blackhearted merchants such as themselves, to conquer England. And so the d*tchman Pharoe William of Orange usurp the rightful throne of England, and lead to the Second Exodus.", "SECTION SIX - THE PROMISED LAND\n \nThe righteous Gelts and Saac'ssons sailed over the ocean following the light of the setting sun, just as their Israelite Scythian ancestors once had twenty centuries earlier. And so they founded Yankee-Israel, at last returned to their roots with a fresh start in a new land. They carved out homes and roads from the forests and swamps, and pushed out the savage injuns as their ancestors pushed out the canaanite dasyus and fomorians. It was to be a new home for the Celtic and Germanic Israelite races, if not for the vile deeds of the Jews and Dutch.\n \nThe Jews, Dutch, and Spaniards took millions of negroes and transported them across the atlantic, because they were too lazy to do their own work like Jesus King of the Aryans commanded. The most holy words would be repeated by John Smith at Jamestown; HE WHO SHALL NOT WORK, NEITHER SHALL HE EAT.", "SECTION SEVEN - THE CAPTIVITY\n \nThe Yankee, of strong Celto-Germanic Israelite stock, carved out homes from the forest for him and his family. The Southern \"Aristocrat\" however, mostly of Jewish admixture, chose to opress his Geltic brothers by buying up all the land and filling it with beasts of the field (negroes) and denying the Geltic folk of the south any chance to earn their living.\n \nThe Yankee people finally chose to stand up against this injustice and send the enslaved animals back where they belong so Israelites could use the land properly. The southern \"Aristocrats\" chimped out and impressed the Geltic Dixian man to fight for him while he sat back on his porch swing. He would let nothing deprive him of his negroes. And so Israelite brothers fought against eachother again, breaking the commandments of Jesus King of the Aryans.\n \nBy the time the war was over the jews chose to count their losses and become industrialists in the North instead. By doing this they enslaved the Israelite people and drove them from their beautiful God-Given homesteads and into jewish factories. Instead of repenting and doing what needed to be done, the Yankee-Israelite people turned away from God. Foreigners and degenerates have swarmed us exactly as was predicted in Deuteronomy.\n \n \nYankee-Israelites must return to our ancient roots and rise up to kick the canaanites, shemites, and for'ners out of our Promised Land, and never again stray from God's commandments.", ">>228319738\nAlright based\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SbskIcPZh8A", "Perfect.", "What in the actual fuck....", ">>228319485", ">>228319485\nTHREAD THEME\nhttps://youtu.be/7HbRTohn6Ng", ">>228321053\nSorry pagay but the dvbs dont lie\n>>228321111", ">>228319485\nhave meds schizcel", ">>228321461\nSeething edomite shemite", ">>228321547", ">>228319485\nAll I know is that the celts were even up to turkey and egypt, Galilee was seen as a different people from the rest of Judea, because they came from the north and were celtic, that's why we call Jesus the Galilean, he was not a jew at all, Galilee was hated by people of Judea", ">>228319485\n\nYou have to understand the Kikes plagiarized everything from civilizations that are older and greater than their little stupid goat herding desert area.", "Jesus blesses this thread.", ">>228322618\nAll Semites and Semite worshipers are on the same side.", ">>228319485\n\nTo equate the Glorious YADU DYNASTY with stupid kikes is the greatest sin one can ever commit.", "based Bertrand Comparet poster\nMay God rest your soul", ">>228322618\nIt\u2019s okay, Hindus got your back Christbros.

Instead it was a carefully crafted plot to introduce by a conspiratorial body which could not be identified, a highly destructive and divisive element into a large population group targeted for change against its will. New words and new phrases--prepared by Tavistock(1)-- were introduced to America along with the Beatles. Words such as \"rock\" in relation to music sounds, \"teenager,\" \"cool,\" \"discovered\" and \"pop music\" were a lexicon of disguised code words signifying the acceptance of drugs and arrived with and accompanied the Beatles wherever they went, to be \"discovered\" by \"teenagers.\" Incidentally, the word \"teenagers\" was never used until just before the Beatles arrived on the scene, courtesy of the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations.\n\nAs in the case of gang wars, nothing could or would have been accomplished without the cooperation of the media, especially the electronic media and, in particular, the scurrilous Ed Sullivan who had been coached by the conspirators as to the role he was to play. Nobody would have paid much attention to the motley crew from Liverpool and the 12-atonal system of \"music\" that was to follow had it not been for an overabundance of press exposure. The 12-atonal system consisted of heavy, repetitive sounds, taken from the music of the cult of Dionysus and the Baal priesthood by Theo Adorno and given a \"modern\" flavor by this special friend of the Queen of England and hence the Committee of 300.\n\nTavistock and its Stanford Research Center created trigger words which then came into general usage around \"rock music\" and its fans. Trigger words created a distinct new break-away largely young population group which was persuaded by social engineering and conditioning to believe that the Beatles really were their favorite group.", ">>228228816\nAll trigger words devised in the context of \"rock music\" were designed for mass control of the new targeted group, the youth of America.\n\nThe Beatles did a perfect job, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that Tavistock and Stanford did a perfect job, the Beatles merely reacting like trained robots \"with a little help from their friends\"--code words for using drugs and making it \"cool.\" The Beatles became a highly visible \"new type\"-- more Tavistock jargon--and as such it was not long before the group made new styles (fads in clothing, hairstyles and language usage) which upset the older generation, as was intended. This was part of the\"fragmentation-maladaptation\" process worked out by Willis Harmon and his team of social scientists and genetic engineering tinkerers and put into action.\n\nThe role of the print and electronic media in our society is crucial to the success of brainwashing large population groups. Gang wars ended in Los Angeles in 1966 as the media withdrew its coverage. The same thing will happen with the current wave of gang wars in Los Angeles. Street gangs will wither on the vine once media saturation coverage is toned down and then completely withdrawn. As in 1966, the issue would become \"burned out.\" Street gangs will have served their purpose of creating turbulence and insecurity. Exactly the same pattern will be followed in the case of \"rock\" music. Deprived of media attention, it will eventually take its place in history.\n\nFollowing the Beatles, who incidentally were put together by the Tavistock Institute, came other \"Made in England\" rock groups, who, like the Beatles, had Theo Adorno write their cult lyrics and compose all the \"music.\" I hate to use these beautiful words in the context of \"Beatlemania\"; it reminds me of how wrongly the word \"lover\" is used when referring to the filthy interaction between two homosexuals writhing in pigswill. To call \"rock\" music, is an insult, likewise the language used in \"rock lyrics.\"", ">>228229161\nTavistock and Stanford Research then embarked on the second phase of the work commissioned by the Committee of 300. This new phase turned up the heat for social change in America. As quickly as the Beatles had appeared on the American scene, so too did the \"beat generation,\" trigger words designed to separate and fragment society. The media now focused its attention on the\"beat generation.\" Other Tavistock-coined words came seemingly out of nowhere: \"beatniks,\" \"hippies,\" \"flower children\" became part of the vocabulary of America. It became popular to \"drop out\" and wear dirty jeans, go about with long unwashed hair. The \"beat generation\" cut itself off from main-stream America. They became just as infamous as the cleaner Beatles before them.\n\nThe newly-created group and its \"lifestyle\" swept millions of young Americans into the cult. American youth underwent a radical revolution without ever being aware of it, while the older generation stood by helplessly, unable to identify the source of the crisis, and thus reacting in a maladaptive manner against its manifestation, which were drugs of all types, marijuana, and later Lysergic acid, \"LSD,\" so conveniently provided for them by the Swiss pharmaceutical company, SANDOZ, following the discovery by one of its chemists, Albert Hoffman, how to make synthetic ergotamine, a powerful mind-altering drug. The Committee of 300 financed the project through one of their banks, S. C. Warburg, and the drug was carried\nto America by the philosopher, Aldous Huxley.\n\nThe new \"wonder drug\" was promptly distributed in \"sample\" size packages, handed out free of charge on college campuses across the United States and at \"rock\" concerts, which became the leading vehicle for proliferating the use of drugs. The question that cries out for an answer is, what was the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) doing at the time?", ">>228227507\nStephen Spielbergs movies, and indeed almost all movies about children befriending/being terrorized by a \"monster\", are pedophile bullshit. \"Holly Wood\" is also what magic wands were supposed to be made from", ">>228228152\n>the lost world\n>saturn logo", ">>228226783\n\n>demonic-looking wife, Cheryl\n\nWho happens to have fantastic tits.", ">>228229674\nWhat did ET symbolize?

No single political patron has done more for the Clintons over the span of their careers. In the past 20 years, Saban and his wife have donated $2.4 million to the Clintons\u2019 various campaigns and at least $15 million to the Clinton Foundation, where Cheryl Saban serves as a board member. Haim Saban prides himself on his top-giver status: \u201cIf I\u2019m not No. 1, I\u2019m going to cut my balls off,\u201d he once remarked on the eve of a Hillary fundraiser. The Sabans have given more than $10 million to Priorities USA, making them among the largest funders of the pro-Hillary super-PAC. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential campaign, he vowed to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to elect her.\n\nThe ties go beyond money. The Clintons have flown on the Sabans\u2019 private jet, stayed at their LA home, and vacationed at their Acapulco estate. The two families watched the 2004 election results together at the Clintons\u2019 home, and Bill Clinton gave the final toast at one of Cheryl Saban\u2019s birthday parties.\n\nLike any political benefactor, Saban has an agenda. Unlike many, however, he is startlingly transparent about what he wants and how he intends to get it. \u201cI\u2019m a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel,\u201d he has said. A supporter of the late Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Labor Party leader and pro-peace prime minister, Saban has drifted rightward in recent years. \u201cIn general, he\u2019s taking a harder line,\u201d says former US Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk. Saban says he still believes in a two-state solution, but his all-consuming concern is defending Israel and fortifying its relationship with the United States. \u201cFor me,\u201d he said several years ago, \u201cbringing the American president closer to the people of Israel is a life goal.\u201d", ">>228230131\n>>228230159\nThe phallic (remember his neck also grotesquely extends) crossdressing \"alien\" from beyond the stars corrupts the muh youth.

So yea, Jesus told one rich guy, when he was alone with him in a room with the 12 disciples, to give all his stuff away to the poor when the guy asked how he could be a holier person. I still stand by the fact presented that this wasn't something ever preached in a sermon to a crowd of people. Jesus said a lot of different things to different people in different situations. There was, for instance, the time when that girl washed his feet with expensive incense and one of the disciples was like \"Hey Jesus we could sell that incense for 200 silver and spread the bounty amongst the poor instead of wasting it on your feet\" and Jesus said, yea that's true but it's a special occasion and this girl is going to be remembered for what she's doing here so just let it happen.\n\nSo yea I don't know, what's the take-away? He gave some specific advice to one rich guy who was asking a specific question. Does this make him a marxist communist who wants to abolish all property rights? No I don't think so. It sounds like he didn't think highly of the rich people of his time, who lived in the place he lived. It's a common theme in Buddhism and Hinduism that the more material possessions you have, the harder it is to really focus on what is really important in life. The things you own end up owning you, that sort of thing. If somebody was rich and claimed to live their life as a holy man in all the ways this man claimed, and then asked the question \"how can I take this further\", I can't think of any more appropriate response than \"give your stuff to the poor and devote your life in the service of others\".

They hold grudges and plot revenge. \nSports studies show this, where males are more likely to become friends after beating the shit out of each other. Women make enemies or fake friendships where they undermine each other and cultivate gay girlfriend groups. \n\nOf course this is the female weakness. Men are better at joining together and suppressing women than the reverse. Women aren\u2019t naturally good at being allies with each other (except in \u201cvictim\u201d bonding), they\u2019re too violent and sociopathic to accomplish this kind of social organization.

They are inherently materialistic. Their lust informs the male lust for resources as well. Male greed is a function of the male desire for reproductive desirability/status among women. The most perverse of male wars (for materialism) are feminine in nature. A purely masculine war is where men fight for some abstract concept of honor, enlightenment in a feminine/material world (materialism is feminine), going to Valhalla, or reaching some enlightened state through rebellion against the feminine universe. \n\nWomen are closer to animals, and don\u2019t fully understand any of these things except for their own personal needs and base narcissisms. Many of the human existential problems arise from the fact that the species is propagated by a being that is spiritually close to the material world. All ancient knowledge is aware of this.\n\nAlso, we\u2019ve done this before. Women did supplant men in society.\nThat society fell and it was so terrible that ancient societies became heavily masculine for thousands of years after. Everyone in their ancestor memories knows that women are latently evil and femininity is a meme created by men who wanted women to be good (because they\u2019re pretty). But most ancient cultures recognize that goddesses are often sociopathic hunters, or goddesses of death and destruction, and fertility goddesses are frequently associated with violence and destruction, while male gods were violent and sometimes petty, but were more likely to feel things like guilt, genuine compassion, unconditional love, loyalty, honor, and all the higher virtues that make humanity unique.

At this point the term state is outdated, as a state can define itself only in antithesis to other states fighting for control.
