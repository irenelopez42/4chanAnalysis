I've always been somewhat autistic, whether or not I have autism or aspergers I'm not sure. I am diagnosed with ADHD and OCD however. One time I was with my girlfriend, my friend, his girlfriend and another friend of ours, and we took some sketchy MDMA. It wasn't like any molly I'd had before, everyone was nervous and looking over their shoulder. My friend was convinced the bouncer was following him and I was convinced in the taxi ride home that the taxi driver was cooperating with the police and that they would turn up at my door at any second.\n\nAt some point during the \"afterparty\" if you will at my home, my friend's girlfriend started getting nervous about her health and was seeing blotches on her legs. I looked when she told me to out of concern, and I suddenly had this feeling I've never had before, of looking at something I shouldn't and being judged for it. I've never been attracted to this girl, but I all of a sudden had this OCD rumination of worrying about appearing as if I was. That night I began to stare at her out of my peripheral vision, no matter where I was looking or who I was talking to, no matter where my eyes were facing, my peripheral vision was focused on her, and people around me could tell but didn't want to say anything. Made the rest of the evening completely awkward. \n\nEver since then, I've had this every single time I'm in a multiple person gathering.

Also, I wanted to break up, and I ended up sleeping with her 2 days later. I wasn't even sure what I wanted. I thought it'd be a good idea to just cool my head down a little, and focus on exams, while I think this through. Are you seriously saying me not \"ghosting\" someone for 2 days would've prevented them from literally sleeping with someone \"new\"? Like, you don't just go out to a place, and fuck the first guy that approaches you. This must've been going on for longer, when she sensed I was becoming distant. \n\nSee, the reason I'm conflicted still is because most people told me it's for the better, I should've tried being someone's therapist, she didn't deserve me etc., but every now and then someone instills guilt into me for \"ghosting\" a literal monkeybrancher cheater with an alcohol dependancy without a HS, DESPITE 1.5y struggle to try and get her to stop doing exactly that, ditch booze, get off xanax, and enroll into bloody HS at 19. \n\nShe also told me \"I want to drink as much as I can now, because when I enroll back to school this summer I'll quit cold turkey\". You have one try to guess if she enrolled. She's anxious yes, but so am I. Doesn't excuse me to go and break someone's heart like that. I haven't been able to break up with her because of fear of damaging her.

I've never done it to anyone, but I don't know why I even thought of not responding. But at NO point was I planning on hurting someone. On the other hand, I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I was a catch for her. Going to uni, gonna have a good job in a year, get my own place, a car, ambitious, trying to get her to learn new things, being a supportive person in her life, trying to get her to enroll back to uni, explain she's got potential in life, reason with her why she should get off Xanax because I've been through that same path (she's been taking Xanax for a year straight, you're only supposed for 1 month max), trying to get her to reduce booze. I drank during the first few months with her, but when I noticed she literally can't stop, I quit drinking around her, and supported her to reduce as well. Now, why instead of putting in at least 10% effort, and actually bettering her life, she decided to throw it all away? This is the million dollar question bothering me. At no point did I hurt her physically, cheated, talked with girls behind her back, made her feel worthless, put her down or anything of that sort. On the contrary, I was trying to boost her confidence. Why would someone throw this away, then even blame me for everything, as if I hadn't done shit during our entire relationship, just because I naturally started to lose feelings during the last month, because she wasn't putting in any effort at all?

When you feel sad you think about sad things and if you can't stop thinking about sad things then that's a form of depression. We now know that you really do need to take console with someone you trust to get over things. You can mute yourself if you want to but eventually it's going to reveal itself as you get older.

It's basically the art of using mindfulness to stop fighting thoughts that come to you. The less you fight your thoughts and just let them sit there, the faster they'll go away. And they'll come back, but the more you do ACT, the less power they'll hold on you over time.\n\n2) Get an OCD therapist to do exposures. Expensive (was 175 a session for me) but worth it if you can https://iocdf.org/ \n\n3) Know that medication works (even if it takes time to find the right one) and that there are good psychiatrists out there.

No, of course not. Its hard, if not impossible, to achieve total perfection in such a thing.\nBut as traditional media died, the new media became reliant on clicks. Things that inspire rage and hatred get people to click on articles far more often, and thus constant race baiting became the norm. If a black man died at the hands of police, it was national news and was just \"solid proof of a nation with systemic issues built in from day 1 against black people and other minorities\".\n>people who are already racist and prejudiced towards black people will only confirm their beliefs\nThis is true. I think some people who are genuinely trying to hold peaceful protests realize this. \nUnfortunately however, Antifa & parts many of BLM are taking great advantage of this situation and intentionally sparking violence at these events. Its weird and difficult to explain to friends why escalation happens so quickly. But at an even with THOUSANDS where tensions are high, if one punch is thrown, police must react to keep it from spreading. When police react, people freak out because they think they are all about to eat the ground. When they freak out, the police react harder to gain control. And its a cycle that continues. Its hard to break, especially when those starting the problems know exactly how its going to go. \nCouple all this with social media literally brainwashing people from a young age that every cop you'll ever meet is a racist or a bastard, and its a bad mix.

Cali is notoriously liberal/communist/socialist, and and police in general.\nI think the overall strangest thing about this, is that demands were being met.

Now its been fucked to hell and back, and what message does that send? That it was all for nothing. Its sad. That cop was arrested and charged with murder, but they still want more. Its never enough honestly. And I think a major issue of it is, the public is not well informed on how the police system works or why they do things the way they do. Why they are quick to stamp out early signs of violence, why they take time to arrest an office who has killed someone (because many times it can be in self defense, and you MUST be absolutely certain that is wasn't in order to arrest them). Ignorance absolutely plays a large role in it imo.\n\nI've lost good friends over not thinking that every cop is a terrible person recently. People I thought were okay with having political differences. Its honestly sad. The media has honestly poisoned America to such a degree that I wonder if its even possible for us to recover. Whats worse, if I fear that after these riots are all said and done, racial divisions will only have widened. Black people will hate whites more, along with cops. I fear of more self waiting whites arising. I fear more whites who hate blacks starting up actual hate groups again. I fear more media propaganda. Its somewhat scary. While I can avoid the riots as I live outside the city, my works been closed.

There\u2019s a lot to unravel, but I\u2019ll try to stick to the highlights. During quarantine, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of introspection. After 6 years of dating, I have spent at least 4 of them putting in almost zero effort into my life. I wouldn\u2019t do dishes or laundry or anything that didn\u2019t have immediate tangible consequences. I lied to try and make my life easier or to make myself feel better. I didn\u2019t follow through on anything I said and was not dependable. I have realized that I was living my life in a way that I am not okay with and being a person that I didn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve worked hard to scrutinize what I say and do on a daily basis to change the things that didn\u2019t align with my character. My girlfriend of those 6 years is away with family since she has a break from in-person school during COVID. She is obviously hurt by the person I was. I have explained the process that I\u2019ve been going through to her and in the instances that we talked, I found myself genuinely listening and feeding back into the conversation. She is reluctant to put effort into the relationship and trust me due to the large number of times that I have promised to change some behavior and never done it in our relationship. She is not feeding back into conversations we have, so they come off as interviews. If I don\u2019t ask a question, they will end. I am very very confident that once she sees me like this and spends time with the person she actually loves instead of the person I\u2019ve been that things will get better. My question is how should I approach our relationship until then from a distance? I\u2019ve asked her to show me she cares and put energy into our relationship again.

It would be the same way with really bad social anxiety issues. Every time you are around other people your mind would instantly start thinking anxious thoughts and it would fuck you up mentally. Self justifying your emotional thinking will make lead you down \"logical\" paths that are hallmarks of emotional problems. Like avoidance. You anxious people tend to avoid things that cause problems. It's part of the fight, flight, freeze response.

We U-Haul early and often because I think a lot of women just socially have different goals in partners than a lot of men. Gay men and straight men tend to have the goal of having a lot of good sex, if on top of good sex they get a emotional intimate partner able to make them happy and split the rent and cook and clean and live happily together all the better. Lesbians and straight women want that living together emotional intimacy first, and if you can have good sex on top all the better.\n\nBoth sexes want the same things out of a relationship it's just men tend to place sex higher in their immediate needs while women put living happy and intimacy higher in their needs.\n\nStill for both gay women and men there's this sense of urgency. All gays know another single gay is some scarce shit. If you yourself are a good looking stable single gay you know you're a good rare catch to any other single good looking gay. But also that gay is rare. You both look at each other with this rush anxiety of \"fuck we both better do something now cause when the fuck else am I gonna get someone good and single and gay\". So for gay men that anxious rush plus men highly valuing sex means they fuck pretty quick. For gay women it means they move in very quickly together.\n\nAlso gays mature later sexually and in relationship skills. A straight girl may learn in her teens with her first boyfriend that it's not worth rushing into relationships. A gay isn't gonna learn that till mid to late 20s. Usually because they spent their teens in the closet or secretly experimenting.

We're friends with women, we love women, we fuck women. To us 10 hours on a call is great because we love women.

Truly a cursed existence to be straight desu.", ">>22122021\nThat's also true. But I don't think it's just straight men not liking straight women, that's an issue for incels sure. I think in general it's more nuanced. There's this whole us v. them mentality between the straight sexes. Straight women in relationships talk about men as if they're some other species. Hell half the bullshit asks in the ask the opposite sex threads could be solved if they'd just calmly talk to their significant other about their issues like they do in the thread but they wanna go for retarded trick solutions because they're convinced the opposite sex is too fundamentally different from themselves. In a gay relationship you can't think us v them cause you're both the same damn sex. I, as a woman, know I can talk to my girlfriend and we'll work shit out together. If she's acting crazy moody I don't just make a thread all \"gdi why are all women fucking bipolar narcissist bitches\" I try to reason through why she'd be acting moody. What would make me moody? Maybe she's hungry or tired cause fuck me I'm a cranky ass bitch if even a little sleep deprived. Maybe she's horny and we need to fuck more. Maybe there's an issue she's holding from me. Fucking whatever it is I'm gonna look for solutions to the issue with her instead of writing it off as another unchangeable fact of the sexes being different.\n\nStraights just get too into the whole women are from Venus men from Mars bullshit.

Its going to be uncomfortable. You're going to try to find excuses to either sabotage or abandon the relationship because, subconsciously, being abandoned is infinitely more comfortable to you than being truly vulnerable in a relationship. Keep this in your mind and incorporate it into your introspection.\n\nSecondly, you have to tell him everything you told us. Tell him how you feel about him. Express to him exactly what your issues are and what kinds of expectations you hope for in this relationship. Clearly communicate the pace at which you'd like to go. Do not spare any detail. Do NOT compromise your feelings in an attempt to save him from discomfort. If he is an even remotely suitable partner and decent, moral person he will listen to you and respect your perspective. Taking these kinds of big steps in relationships can be scary and its important that both parties remain open about both their desires and apprehensions. \n\nTalk to him. Don't worry about hurting his feelings. Be honest, be open and let him know that you're communicating these things with him because you give a shit about this relationship and want it to succeed. Being able to communicate these things successfully is going to be a huge, crucial step for you.", ">>21891546\nhi Anon, thank you for taking the time to reply. \n\n>address your impulse to jump in abandoning relationships \nI was abandoned twice as a child and as much as it pains me to admit it I'm still dealing with the consequences of that, my last relationship before this one was a codependency disaster I don't want to go through ever again. \n\nThe bit about this making me subconsciously trying to sabotage things out of fear is oddly reassuring too, since I was starting to fear I had made a mistake and unwittingly led him on too much, too soon. \n\nthank you a bunch for the input, I will bring it up to him tomorrow even if he doesn't, hopefully it goes well for both of us.", ">>21891496\n>>21891635\nYou're trying to against your nature, and I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with abandonment. You and women find certain men attractive if they are and do certain things. Him confessing his love first is usually not a good thing. The fact you weren't excited when he told you this is bad, and even worse you're asking. It's implied you knew he's had a history of this in the past before he confessed he loved you.

Made out with dozens.\nHave a girl coming over to bang tonight, date tomorrow and on Sunday all with different girls with more being lined up as we speak.\nI get to have my pick now. Never thought this shit could happen to me. \nWell it didn't. I MADE it happen and so can all of you.", ">>21868294\nwhat was your regime? work out, barhopping, etc.?", ">>21868303\nHonestly, it was such a complicated journey, it's hard to summarize it as a \"regime\".\n\nFirst thing I did was actually resolve to lose it. The thought of having sex and intimate relations with girls was so outlandish to me back then, I needed to internalize the thought, that I was ACTUALLY going to start trying.\nI made sure, that my apartment was always clean enough to invite a girl into and also, for the first time in my life, I bought a pack of condoms.\nI internalized the thought, that having sex from now on was a realistic possibility and was gonna be prepared for it.\n\nNext, I just talked to girls more in my social field. I just tried my best to interact with them more. Even in small, platonic ways. I was still far from anything actually happening, but it was a start. Also, I did nofap. Not because of some magical powers, cause that's bullshit, but I just told myself \"If you want to have sexual release, get a woman to do it.\"\n\nAt a party one day, it just finally happened. I got really drunk, met a girl who seemed into me. At some point when talking to her, I just bit the bullet and hamfistedly asked her if she wanted to go \"have some fun\" (terrible approach, looking back, but it worked). \nI fucked up spectacularly, but I had my first sexual encounter then. P in V, french kissing, the works.\nIt was pretty bad, but I did it.\n\nAfter that, I had another pretty long dry spell. I tried even harder though, to the point of desperation. Would be another few months before I could get another go at it. On a road trip, met a girl and drunkenly fucked her. This time, it was fucking spectacular. She sexted me for weeks after, begging for my dick. To this day, maybe the most amazing sex of my life.\n\nAt this point, I started reading more about seduction and the like and got more into the PUA type stuff. I didn't have sex that year again, but I made out several times and had some over the clothes action.\nThat was 2018", ">>21868391\nYa but what if you're a romantic and just want that one girl to love and don't want to go through the pussy wagon bang std train?", ">>21868391\nIn 2019, I continued to learn more about seduction from PUA sources, redpill and the like.\nI read Mark Mansons \"Models\" (which I would still recommend, unlike all the redpill stuff).\nThat helped me a bunch. I also read Rollo Tomassis \"The rational male\". The philosophy of that book is dreadful, but it did help me IMMENSELY. I recommend you read it, but take everything with a grain of salt, since Tomassi is a seriously damaged woman hater.\nThe overlap from these two books is what I found to be the \"secret\" to being an attractive male.\n>Don't be needy, ever\n>Have \"abundance mentality\", have options\n>Have goals and values that you stick to\n>Don't take women and dating so super seriously\n\nThis year, I had my first \"girlfriend\", who I met through dating apps. She was very inexperienced and a bit weird, but she was very cute and I liked her a lot. We still text sometimes.\nI had sex with her MANY times and also had a few one night stands that year.\n\nFinally, we arrive in 2020. At this point, I have a rotation of at least 4 girls that I am texting, either looking to bang or already banging, while I am looking for a serious girlfriend.\nA lot of it is coming from my now pretty decent tinder, which is a steady stream of leads, the occasional cold approach, (nowhere near as much as most PUAs would advise you to do, when I see a girl that I like and she sends me signals, I go for it, but I don't try to force myself to just haphazardly approach x women anymore) and my social circle. \n\nThe most important thing I learned, is to recognize the subtle style of communication women use and not to be afraid to feel sexually valuable.\nWomen DO want to sleep with me, I am worthy of that for sure. I can flirt, I can seduce and make moves now. \nEven though there were points in the journey (which is never over I think) where I broke down crying from frustration and just thinking \"what is wrong with me\", I think I am so much better off now.", ">>21868402\nYou still have to learn about attracting women.\nYou can't go through life and just expect your dream woman to magically pop into your life at one point. You have to learn what makes a man attractive, or your dream woman will walk right past you.\n\nAlso, you don't have a soul mate in this world, that is a retarded Disney fairytale.\nThere are many women that you are compatible with, you have to learn who those are and what you want from your dream girl and then you shape each other into being that person. That's what a true relationship is about.\nYou can't go from virgin to finding your dream girl in one hop, you have to learn about romance, attraction and what women you actually like first. You don't have to be promiscuous to do that, but being a serial monogamist and a sexless frustrated chump in between relationships does not serve men well, as you can observe around you.\nAs toxic and dumb as redpill is, they are right about one thing. The reality of the sexual market, is not the dumb fairytale shit you have been fed from the media since childhood.", ">>21868424\nOh I'm not OP and not a virgin.

I'm a male, and I kinda know how he feels, so I'll try to help you. I have a strong lack of self-esteem, heavy insecurity and probably the worst thing, and what your bf suffers from: Trust issues. When people are betrayed, cheated on, or hurt from something in the past, it's a common thing to get conscious about it. However, there are some cases where the person gets overwhelmed by those feelings, and it turns the person into someone extremely closed towards other people. I can't show affection to someone no matter how much I love that person, and how much I try. I can't share my feelings with someone because I'm afraid to get involved, eventually getting serious, and cheated on, or losing that person in the end. In my case, the love of my life died. I don't know what happened in the past of your boyfriend, but he definitely had something like that happening.\nIf you truly want to be with someone as problematic as that, then you'll need to really show him how much you love him. Before he feels the urge to run from the relationship, make sure he tells you his past, and try to find out what made him like that. And definitely never, EVER feel or show pity towards him. I can't really help you more than that, because I've never had anyone who wanted to deal with me except from the one who died, but I believe that will help you to figure out what to do by now.", "I stopped seeing a girl over one night of her trying to interrogate me about my estranged father.

I say let sleeping dogs lie. \n\nIf you really want a clue into his worries, I guarantee you that they are something along the lines of \"I should be farther along in my career/life than I am, and I'm falling behind my peers somehow.\" \n\nThat's because every single man in his early 20s worries about this because we're taught to measure the value of our lives by career and social success and not personal satisfaction. \n\nHe'll grow out of it eventually, and talking about it with him like you want isn't going to speed up that process. He's gotta find the answer for himself.", ">>21741333\nmen can be really dumb like that unfortunately, a lot of guys think showing emotion makes them look too weak or vunerable, and I always feel sad for those who can't open up because of this. Then again, some guys are just reserved and keep to themselves. I'm engaged to a guy who's pretty stoic and even toned in most situations, but he's slowly grown out of his shell with all the years we've been together. Every once and a while, he'll tell me something that's effecting him emotionally that I know he'd never share with anyone else. I think it just takes time, you can't force it. But reminding him every once and a while that he can tell you anything without judgement never hurts if you are genuine about it.", ">>21741364\n22 dating someone in high school...", ">>21741422\nAnd?", ">>21741346\nThis. Sounds like he learned one of life's lessons the hard way.\n\nIf you're like 99.9% of women, when he opens up you won't be able to unsee him as weak and emotional. Deep within your female unconscious something will go off that will essentially convince you that you can never depend on him and especially have an eventual family with him. You will start to resent him and it will build and then want to leave him and you won't know why. This is how women evolved and it's not their fault. Men have evolved and are programmed to do similar shallow things.", ">>21741413\n>men can be really dumb like that unfortunately, a lot of guys think showing emotion makes them look too weak or vunerable, and I always feel sad for those who can't open up because of this.\nBecause a lot of people will think less of you if you open up.
