However, the remainder of what you've written makes me think you've pushed this concept to the back of your mind in an act of desperation to get that feeling of connection that you have with this woman. You sense a change. Fearing the loss of this connection, you're urgently trying to return to how things were, but in your panic you're moving things further away by putting in more effort than she is. \n\nPerhaps your fears are a reality and she's cheating on you, or maybe the effort gap is something that's been growing without you noticing and she's starting to lose interest. People generally don't like to feel like their partner's mood, life, etc is completely dependant on them, and from what I'm reading here, I feel that's the message you're sending to her via your behavior, and what that means is that it won't matter whether she's cheating or not, you'll end up breaking up regardless. \n\nWhat you need to do is not dwell on not having control over the relationship, because its bypassing the issue of having a lack of control over yourself.

And I don't know whether to go to the police or not.\n\nThis is going to be a long, LONG story, /adv/. A long one, so brace yourselves, and probably grab popcorn or something.\n\n*a-hem*\n\nMy boy, my oldest child, was so good when he was little, but something broke inside of him when he was a teenager.\n\nMy wife and I always accepted, loved, and encouraged him. We pushed him to work hard and treat people with respect. I don't know where exactly we failed him but as a father I feel responsible for the thing he's turned into.\n\nIt started when he was 14. He had began to become withdrawn and emotional. We chalked it up to teenaged mood swings. For some reason he was just so angsty and bitter all the time. We were worried about his lack of social life and his over-reliance on his computer. He kind of hid himself in the online world so my wife and I began to limit his computer time, but he simply became more aggressive and confrontational.\n\nHis hygiene was bad, and he was always confrontational when we told him to shower or do laundry. His room stank horribly and we eventually had a huge fight over it where he physically shoved my wife and called her a bitch, and eventually we got him to at least clean and air out his room regularly on the grounds that it was our house and if he couldn't maintain his space he wouldn't be entitled to it - essentially we got to the point where we told him he wouldn't be allowed his worldly possessions or privacy unless he took care of the space we all shared. the room still smelled and he was still rude about cleaning it but we could tell him to get it clean and he would do it after that."}, "replies": [">2/8\nWe ended up getting a call from his school saying that a female student felt harassed by him. We were shown messages where he continually badgered her to have sex with him, threatened to \"punish\" her for stringing him along, sending her unsolicited nudes, telling her some violent fantasies of his, and eventually just descending into some horrid rage-filled rant about how she is just another \"whore\" and other things.\n\nWe were shocked. We explained to him why this behaviour was unacceptable, and I explained to him that it was ok to be sexually active but his actions were toxic and abusive.\n\nI tried mentoring him man-to-man, taking him on camping trips and whatnot and talking to him about women and girls and trying to give him advice. I suggested he try showering, changing up his hair and facial hair styles, trying out different fashion styles, maybe going to the gym.\n\nI told him some hard truths - that he doesn't want a gross woman so he shouldn't be a gross man. By gross I mean hygiene and looks. I explained to him that good looks are more hygiene and self care than genetics but he refused to accept what I said to him.\n\nAfter that I caught him sniffing his sister's panties in the laundry room - she was 12 at the time and he was 17. He assured me it had nothing to do with his sister, he said he just had a panty sniffing fetish and he pretended they belonged to girls from porno videos, but still I gave him hell for it, and he was grounded and lost his computer for 6 months. I went through his computer and I was disgusted by the kinds of hateful, racist, incel forums he frequented, the horrid things he said about women, and his save file was full of cartoon porn with girls of questionable ages. I wiped the hard drive completely and began strictly monitoring his online activity. I used parental filters to block incel sites and and porn sites that hosted cartoon porn.", ">3/8\nThe next big issue was something he did to my daughter's friend. My daughter is 5 years his junior, and one day after a sleepover, my daughter came to me and said her friend wanted to tell me something but was afraid of what I would say.\n\nMy son cornered this 13 year old girl and physically blocked her path and touched her hair and face while making very inappropriate comments about her body and asking her if she liked to sleep naked and what kind of underwear she wore.\n\nI tore into my son for that, my wife and I both shouted at him, and told him his behaviour was horrible and I told him then that if his actions got him arrested I would not defend him. He accused us of not loving him, but I told him the reason I was so passionately angry in that situation is because I do love him, and I want to help him become a good man so he can stop being so predatory and bitter and miserable. I told him some hard truths. That he did this all to himself and that he is the only one he can blame for how bitter he is.\n\nI suggested he look to women his own age and he went on a rant about how it was a waste of time because women were already whores (and his definition of a whore is a woman who has had sex even just once) by 17. I called him out on his bullshit and expressed clearly that if he harassed young girls anymore I would personally turn him in.\n\nI invited my daughters friend over after and I personally apologized to her for her experiences, I cried in shame for my son's behaviour and begged her forgiveness for allowing her to feel unsafe in my home and promised her that if she ever felt uncomfortable she could come to my wife and I and we would always believe and help her. Luckily, my daughter didn't lose this friend, but for safety I installed a lock on my daughter's door.", ">4/8\nWe got my son therapy but he refused to engage with the therapist, calling him a \"sand nigger\" and \"pajeet\" and \"terrorist\". His next therapist was a \"chad\", so he didn't relate to that either.\n\nWe fought about him not trying, not getting a job, and he said he couldn't get one because of the immigrants, to which I pointed out that he was struggling because he got fired from his high school jobs for being lazy.\n\nAfter those fights, my wife tried to empathize with him and understand what made him so bitter but he flipped out at her, and called her a cock-gargling whore and said that she fucked her way through dozens of men until she found a \"beta-fag\" who was willing to shelter her for missionary sex.\n\nMy wife, who works and contributes to the family income, who is an independent, professional woman.\n\nHonestly, I lost it more than ever before. I had never been so angry when I heard what he said. That may be his mom, he may be my son, but the woman he was abusively tearing into is my god damn wife. No one can treat my wife like that.\n\nI am ashamed to say in my anger, he shoved me and I physically retaliated, shoving him back, and pinning him against the wall. I felt ashamed of myself, I have never been an angry or violent person, but I couldn't control myself. I've never put my hands on either of my children in such a way in my life, I hate child abusers... but this boy was no child. He was a grown man.", ">5/8\nHe was intimidated and backed down, and for a while he was peaceful.\n\nThe last straw was this week.\n\nMy daughter has dated 3 people her whole life. A boy, a girl, and now another boy. We were as open about sex with my daughter as we were with my son. We asked if she would like to have a question-free steady supply of condoms left in her bathroom drawer, and if she wanted to get on birth control. She said no to both questions with her first boyfriend. She never really brought him home but we met him at one of her recitals. When she had a girlfriend she went over to her house all the time, and didn't want to bring her to the same house her brother lived in, a sentiment I understood.\n\nBut her most recent boyfriend has a lot going on behind the scenes in his family. He's a nice boy but his mom is a single mom of 4 and they struggle.\n\nThis boy started coming around a month after they got together. I like him. My daughter is happy with him. He treats her with respect. He is an intelligent boy. He's an absolute gentleman. He's respectful and polite in our home. He calls me sir, calls my wife Ma'am, he offers to help with the cooking or dishes or cleaning while he's visiting, he talks to us, he's a bit of an amateur cook himself and brings us food all the time to say thank you for taking care of him, when we go out for dinner he always offers to pay for himself and my daughter (though I know he doesn't have much money so I always pay). When getting out of the car he opens the door for my wife and offers her his hand (he sits behind her for leg room). He holds the doors, when we leave somewhere he helps my daughter put her jacket on like those sweet old fashioned couples.", ">6/8\nThis young man works hard, and gives what little he has to his mom and siblings. Like I said, I really respect the boy. I offered him money once for groceries for his family but he turns me down and says he would feel guilty accepting my money like that. He's appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and he had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over his arms, and I said \"take it son, it's cold.\" He had tears in his eyes as he said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told him he could keep it if he brought cookies for us next time he visited.\n\nWhen Christmas came along, I invited him over for supper, and when I went to pick him up I delivered some presents for his family, and on the ride back to my house we had a moment. He was crying because he didn't have much to give us - he got everyone in our house a present but he cried anyways because he felt it wasn't enough to make up for what we gave him. I pulled over, and I just hugged him, and I said to him that it wasn't the value of what he got, it was that he got us anything at all. I thanked him for treating my daughter so well, and I told him he would always be welcome in my home.\n\nMy own son didn't get us anything for christmas, not even a card bought with the money we give him. This boy got my wife and I matching wine glasses since we like to share a bottle every now and then.\n\nMy son didn't eat with us. He pillaged the food table and ran away to his room alone while my daughter's boyfriend met my sister and her family and my parents and my uncle. They all told me how charming he was and how polite he was. Meanwhile after dinner my son told my 5 year old nephew \"fuck off Faggot\" for asking to play a game with him. A man over 20 years old.\n\nLast week, my wife and I went out for an evening to ourselves. We went to dinner, then we went to an upscale bar to play some pool, then we went home.", ">7/8\nWhen I walked in the door, the kids were screaming at each other. I came in to see my son and my daughter's boyfriend fighting. The boyfriend was just pushing my son back and trying to redirect him, my son was throwing punches and charging him. My daughter was crying and sitting against the wall clutching her face. I got between them and pushed them apart, and demanded to know what was happening.\n\nMy son went on a tirade about how he found birth control pills and heard \"whore\" sounds from her room, so he kicked open her door and discovered them having sex, he said he couldn't believe his own sister would \"be a nigger's whore\" and called the poor boy a monkey and other things.\n\nMy wife got my daughter and her boyfriend out of there and I yelled at my son for how he was acting. Eventually I got nowhere with him so I made him wait in his room. I went to talk to my daughter. I apologized to her boyfriend, crying as I did, telling him that I hope he could forgive me for letting this happen. He said he was sorry for getting violent but that he only did it because my son hit her. My daughter cried and said he was a psycho and threatened to rape her, and that he admitted to ejaculating on her toothbrush and hair brush.\n\nI charged into his room, and I said firmly that he should pack his bags and leave. I told him I would pay to have his things sent to him, wherever he went, but that he was leaving tomorrow.\n\nMy wife stayed at my sisters, and my daughter and her boyfriend spent the next few nights at his place.\n\nThe next day I practically threw my son out of the house kicking and screaming.\n\nI took his key back and changed the alarm codes and garage door code. A day later I had a message requesting some of this things - mostly his gaming stuff - be delivered to some strange apartment block I didn't recognize a couple of towns over. A college aged man buzzed me in and I delivered the stuff. I didn't see my son.", ">Conclusion\nMy wife and I then went through his room. My daughter's boyfriend came over and helped me move his furniture to the garage. We threw out his mattress and some other more gross and smelly things, and we took out the carpet to be replaced.\n\nHidden in the closet was a treasure trove of my daughter's underwear, so saturated with old, moldy semen that they were as hard as bricks. The unnerving part was that there were a few pairs my daughter was adamant didn't belong to her. And they were too small for my wife. It was possible he stole them from my nieces.\n\nThere was a sketchbook containing graphic drawings of my son violently raping different women and keeping little girls chained up in some kind of sex dungeon. I went through his old phone that was still working, and all his photos were screenshots of my nieces and their friends in their bikinis, lots of cartoon porn, lots of red pill and incel and Trump memes. He still had messenger, so I checked his messages, most of them were just him trying to harass women and underaged girls.\n\nI checked his Email and... much to my disgust, he stole private photos of my wife from her phone, and he was selling them.\n\nToday, I went to the police with everything and told them everything.\n\nI gave my baby boy everything... I don't know why he went down this road. But I'm just so sorry I failed him. I don't know what the police will do... but I hope they stop him before he hurts someone else.\n\nThe sad thing is... yesterday, once it was all over and settled, yesterday we had a wonderful day. One of the happiest we have ever had.\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I should call the police. He's become a very disturbing person who does not listen to anyone, or concede in any manner. And I don't think reasoning with him is the slightest bit possible, so maybe law enforcement might be necessary. I don't know, but it won't leave my mind.", "Stolen from reddit:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9vs05k/my_son_is_a_hateful_incel_and_i_just_cannot_save/", ">>20232037\nsee\n>>20232057", "If this is real, turn him in.

She\u2019s a slob and has trouble taking care of herself or accomplishing any of her goals.\n\n\nWe met on OKCupid in Nov of 2015. We hung out right away, sparks flew, everything was magic, but I knew that I didn\u2019t love her. She\u2019s in the Navy and she told me that she was leaving for Japan in the summer of 2016. I almost left her in February of 2016, because I knew that she wasn\u2019t the one and she was starting to get clingy, but thought it would be cool to date an older, more \u201cmature\u201d woman, and that I\u2019d just see it through until summer. But I was terribly wrong.\n\n\nLooking back there were so many red flags. 27 no car, no drivers license, a lot of debt (8k), no hobbies, never finished high school, failed her Navy advancement test twice (by 2016, she still hasn\u2019t passed), jokes about how bad she is at her job, etc. She was basically a teenager. I had to pay for everything, dates, concerts, festivals, clothes, etc. But I kept telling myself only a few more months, only a few more months.\n\n\nAfter the Navy looked into her, they found out that she wasn\u2019t mentally sound enough to go to Japan (another red flag) so they\u2019re sending her to Washington state. And her leave date was moved from July/2016 to September/2016. She was ecstatic to spend a few more months with me, while I was miserable. Just when I thought I was about to be done with her, in August she told me that she was pregnant. She told me that she was on birth control, so I trusted her (my mistake).

She\u2019s had a couple abortions in the past so she was afraid of ruining her body and losing the ability to have children in the future. She left that September to Washington thinking that she\u2019d raise the kid on her own. I spent a lot of time contemplated my life. I chose the high road and ended up moving to Washington in April, before my son was born in May. I left my job, my friends, my family, my 3 younger siblings, everything to take care of her and my son.\n\n\nI drive from VA to WA with everything in my car and I get to her townhouse to see an absolute mess. I seriously wish that I could go back and take a picture of when I first got there. It was straight out of an episode of hoarders. The whole first floor was trashed, shipping boxes and take out boxes, clothes, just everywhere. She put her bed together wrong so the wood boards kept falling out, she put the vacuum together wrong so everything that you\u2019d vacuum would just blow back out, like I seriously can\u2019t put to words how bad the place was.

Her plan is to be an artist, so I bought her the biggest and nicest iPad Pro, but do you think this hopeful artist has drawn in it? No. It usually sits around, collecting dust. I occasionally check it to see if it\u2019s charged. I\u2019ll send her Procreate (a drawing app) tutorials, artist vlogs, videos of people going from nowhere to having successful patreons and etsy shops, etc.\n\n\nI want to be a good person and stay with her and have a happy family, but it\u2019s getting so hard.

Slowly start touching her ips with your tounge, she will open it and greet you with her tounge. Now your tounges will touch and circle around a little bit, don't overdo it at first, less is more. Draw back after some seconds and let her lean in more. She probably kissed someone before, so she could lead you a bit. Your hands should be on or above her waist. If things get heated you can start grabbing her ass.

It was a cat and mouse game of how can I hide it this time. Eventually I got tired of giving him chances when his addiction had him masturbating to kids and my friends. Thinking about it now I can't believe I didn't leave when he began raping me and forcing me to be his personal porn star to make up for what he had led me to believe he was lacking. \nI have deep insecurity issues now and I'm disgusted by anyone who uses it who tries to be my boyfriend.

I don't know if you could explain it with genetics, or childhood upbringing/early math education, but whatever.\n\nFor everyone else, there's a point in high school or college where math gets hard. For me it was in Abstract Algebra, for you it's calculus. It's all the same. And after that, it's all up to you to work hard. Don't pay attention to your peers who'll say \"oh I didn't realize we had a test and I still got a 92 haha I did so bad\". Fuck them.\n\nThe most important thing in math is that every single lecture builds on top of the previous one, which means if you even miss one, you're setting yourself up to be screwed for the rest of the class. Go to every single class and take really good notes. Do the homework literally the same day as its assigned (I told you it would be hard work). And here's the thing: if you even have the slightest doubt about a homework question, even if you got it but you had a what-if question, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. This is the easiest thing to do and you'll probably be alone because no one fucking goes to office hours anymore. It's literally free 1 on 1 tutoring. And the truth is most professors round up your grade a little if you go to office hours *consistently* throughout the semester (though don't go just for the sake of it, actually have real questions).\n\nOnce you're done with your homework, if you've done it diligently and without cheating (WolframAlpha/friends), you should actually be most of the way there. For the test, review all your homework problems. Re-do all of the ones you missed without looking at the answer. Skim over the solutions to the ones you got right. Then do 3-4 harder problems from each section. If you get stuck, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Your professor will be so happy that you're doing extra work.\n(1/2)", ">>19830114\n(2/2)\nAlso, read this: http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/VNelson/guide.html.\n\nLast secret: if you go to office hours before a test and ask for practice problems, 90% of professors will give you questions that are very very similar to those on the test. Make sure you know how to do these. Same goes with questions the professor mentions in the weeks before a test.\n\nGood luck OP. You can do it. The great thing about math is that it's simple: no matter how complex math you go, even up to academic research, everything makes sense and everything has a clear reason behind it, even if it's too hard to figure out right now. The conclusions follow solely from the definitions, no additional assumptions needed. You just need to put in the hard work.

Results are always different, but almost never pretty. There are exceptions, as with everything, but that's all they are, exceptions.

Very early on beauty and cosmetic industries discovered that if you pushed a narrative that made women self-conscious about certain aspects of their bodies and appearances you could sell them shit they didn't need and charge out the ass for it. Wrinkle creams, \"anti-aging\" serums, push-up bras, spanks, and about a million other products are immediately tied to the concept that a woman's worth is in her looks; that if she looks older than she is or her breasts aren't as perky as they should be or if her clothes are dated then she is less than.

I'd say, more accurately, that one faction frequently reacts to the other. The market reacts to the movement and the movement reacts to the market. I think the 1970's bra burnings were a great example of modern feminism rebuking a corporate sponsored beauty standard. I'd compare it to the \"organic food\" industry. In this new age of information and high-profile documentaries about the food industry a giant social push against processed food birthed this new movement of \"natural\" food products. The irony is that the natural food industry eventually turned into just as gigantic a corporate monstrosity as their predecessors.

Modern feminist ideals rebuke mainstream beauty standards and embrace counter-culture until the beauty industry figures out how to monetize counter-culture and make it profitable. Its the reason why gigantic corporations buy up smaller beauty companies and market them to consumers as alternatives to mainstream influence. The company that makes vegan, all natural neon-green hair dye is owned by the multinational chemical corporation that dumps their run-off into our rivers and lakes and the consumer actually believes they're apart of the solution.

And not wanting to see these examples to me doesn't mean anything more than either fear that women are not worthwhile partners to you, or a need to feel superior to half the human race. You really think Merkel is a child who manages to keep a hold on Germany and with it Europe for all this time? Or is she a one in millions exception and the others are drooling retards? \n\nI'm sure there's fields in which men are objectively superior as a whole, and for many of the examples you mentioned I'm not well-versed enough in them to judge it. But literature is my own field, I have read many of the proclaimed \"best ever\" authors (Chekov, Hemingway, Joyce, Shakespeare obviously, Nabokov, M\u00e1rquez, Roth...) and Alice Munro can rival any of them in terms of skill and perceptiveness on human nature. Though which one you prefer to read for pleasure is obviously subjective.\n\nAlso no, I wasn't going to say sexism. In order to excel in a field like this you need to invest endlessly in yourself. An artist or anyone with a vision doesn't just need a lot of time for themselves to practice their craft or work out ideas, they also need peace and quiet to be alone with their inner dialogue, they need to feed themselves with the ideas of equals or get inspiration from other art as fuel.

I can see how it clashes with normal emotional responses and fucks up their lives, but they are committed to an ideology which aims to smash the patriarchy. From my perspective is looks like a lot of fucking work and those that handle it the best might as well be responsibly monogamous, they work at being monogamous because they know the terror of losing the stability of that relationship is always a possibility. The ones who actively act out work really hard at it because they are obsessed with sex and the lifestyle/culture ranting to all who will listen about their superior way of life.\n\nThough they are just like anybody else with a singular obsession or boring hobby.

No knowledge of or acknowledgement to the fact there is a strong chemical component.\n\nRelationships are essentially heroine addiction. We are biologically designed to stay close to someone by evolution. Evolution doesn't necessarily prioritize happiness, or comfort over what worked better for our survival as a whole, And yes. People will totally justify their arrangements as though it is entirely their decision. (I can quit whenever I want!) (I just function so much better when I smoke weed). (Coffee makes me more productive). Youve done it, Ive done it, everyone in this thread has at some point justified themselves to others for something that hurts us and we shouldnt do, but we think helps us and we should..\n\nAnd the point is, if you understand the underlying systems in this, you can manipulate it and be happy in a long term relationship.\n\nanyway, citations... aka I win over this type out:\n\nhttp://www.med.uottawa.ca/courses/nsc5104/assets/documents/Dr_Renaud/Young.pdf\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/14153.full", "So what I see is an argument which attempts to rationalise love as evolution driven pair bond and say that the usual biological response programmed into us to create pairing for the duration of weaning a child is outdated and unhealthy, by assigning it special significance we are denying ourselves the chance to experience a wider and richer side to life. Or at least experience significant unhappiness because we deny that it'll happen anyway in secret and thus lead to a whole heap of dishonesty and bad faith.\n\nI'd say that is is wrong to believe in 'the one' or attempt to create relationships built upon unhealthy expectations, but it isn't correct to assume that the three year pair bond window of weaning 'love' is all there is to relationships. If you never get out of the dopamine hit of meeting a new lover, then you'll never see what comes after as anything other than boring.\n\nSure it can look boring by comparison, but it is just different. Just because somebody is statistically likely to hurt you doesn't mean you create polyamorous societies, you just don't set out to create relationships built on expectation. After all, it all ends one way or another and you can only hold on to the good times and be grateful for the time shared and experiences had together.\n\nIt doesn't mean there isn't value in these connections and attempts to create something when you enter into them with an open heart and an open mind remaining grateful for one another.\n\nOr .. the world is fucked.

I'm 34 myself, so probably among the oldest ones here.) and adults get to have sex with other adults, without it being about anything more than pleasure. That being said, there's pleasure to be had from just spending time together with someone you get along with. Now, if I'm taking time to grab a coffee with someone, or hang out at a pub for several hours with a mate, it would be hypocritical to suggest that I'm doing anything more meaningful just because sex is involved. I spend time with other people besides my lover. Sometimes I have sex with some of those people. The difference sex makes shouldn't matter that much more than, say, if I'm comforting a devastated friend, or warmheartedly talk about shared memories with someone - there are emotions involved in the latter, but for some reason we lose our minds as soon as body parts are", "Polyamory is one of those things that I personally would not participate in, but I honestly wouldn't care if other people practiced it\n\nt.

I was saying that was one of many reasons for why many people fail at monogamy. However, the clear distinction to make is that it was not monogamy that failed. \n\nAnd that's not to say that this is at all natural. This is a response to how modern society is organized and how most people are forced into subservience in chemical dependence and wage slavery. Monogamy is harmful to most companies profit margins. The entire concept is against the idea of consumption as it suggests being content with current situations whereas polygamy generally tends towards immediate gratification--which is damn well what makes money. \n\nTo suggest that \"monogamy fails x amount of times\" does not hold up when you consider how our modern society is structured. You seem to be weighing it against this artificial, profit-driven world (which has its positives, yes) and not weighing it against what we're actually biologically hard wired for and furthermore what potentially could be better for people down the line.", ">Humans were made to have lots of partners, monogamy is unnatural! \nI like how this is the only excuse poly apologists can ever come up with, then always neglect to mention the fact that monogamy and having single partner pairs was one of the factors that allowed humans to actually flourish as a species instead of acting like fucking animals ruled only by their impulses.

We might attack the issue from different points, but I've been saying monogamy can work ever since >>19343534\n\nBut don't come pretending monogamy is biological. If it were, women wouldn't be shit testing their husbands into old age. Paternity was most likely not traced until agriculture was invented. The very notion that you got crop as a direct result of planting seeds, is conceptually linked to paternity. As a consequence, civilization tapped into the idea of family, as a deeper construct than the tribal.

Where do you think the term \"alpha\" originates?", "I\u2019m bigamorous. It just seems like the natural order of things. I think a man should have as many women as he can tolerate without going insane. And my limit is 2. They\u2019re enough variety to keep me sexually excited and there\u2019s enough competition to keep them squabbling for my love.", "I think it's way too complicated. People enthusiastic about it tend to really focus on the issues it \"solves\" (cheating, boredom with the same partner), while it creates numerous other issues.\n\nIt's natural for people to be attracted to more people than just their partner, but it's also natural for love to have an element of possessiveness. \"I would only tell this to you\" isn't a compliment for nothing, exclusivity has inherent value. Being fine with your partner sleeping with others is not the end all of polyamory, it's the very start. You have to be okay with them sleeping with others more attractive/young than you are, or perhaps having a much easier time finding additional partners than you do. You have to be fine seeing them in the honeymoon phase with someone else without feeling threatened. You have to be fine with them being less reliably there for you if you need them - \"just give me a call and I'll be there\" can only hold true for so many people before it becomes a false promise. \n\nPlus honestly the idea of how much talking there'd have to be (what kind of \"emergency\" is urgent enough to leave partner A for to rush to the side of partner B; who joins family dinner at Christmas; what about potential kids; protection and STD tests...) seems off putting and exhausting, and like it requires a lot more self-reflection, diplomacy and empathy than most people have. \n\nAll this and then I feel there's worth in monogamy even if it's flawed. It is the complete commitment to put so much of your life, your self-worth, your sexual needs, in one person's hands. That makes you vulnerable and it's scary, but also a hugely meaningful leap of faith. It is a challenge to keep rediscovering one another.\n\nBut, if monogamy is out of the question, (sexually) open relationships or swinging honestly still seems much more fun and more feasible than full on trying to have multiple complete love relationships with emotional intimacy and depth alongside each other.", ">>19344729\n>They\u2019re enough variety to keep me sexually excited\nI don't really understand this reasoning, if you enthusiastically fuck someone for a couple of years you know their body inside and out. Would it really make such a huge difference that one overly familiar body is curvy and one is petite or whatever? There's still tons you're missing out on and there's still nothing new or surprising about them.", ">>19344730\nBest post of the day, desu \n\nOne thing, though. The idea that you're better off, if you choose the less challenging route, in this case monogamy, means you'd rather skip the opportunity to develop more than necessary, as a person.\nYet again, the list of considerations you summed up, only makes it more compelling.", ">>19344715\n>But don't come pretending monogamy is biological. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_in_animals\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory\n\n>If it were, women wouldn't be shit testing their husbands into old age.\nI'm not even sure why you think this is at all a valid point. \n\n>Paternity was most likely not traced until agriculture as invented.\nThat's mostly because most of our historical facts come from pottery and writing which were by and large invented after agriculture. However, if you look at the interactions of a number of modern hunter gather tribes that are still alive, you can still see monogamy being practiced as in for instance the indigenous people in Guyana or Raramuri peoples. Hell, a number of native American tribes also took part in monogamy before, during, and after Columbus. Some also took part in polygamy, yes, but the fact that they they also partook in monogamy is huge evidence towards a biological basis. \n\n>As a consequence, civilization tapped into the idea of family, as a deeper construct than the tribal.\nThe idea of the family was already existing in tribal society just as it currently exists in whales, wolves, elephants, and a number of other species. It didn't become a \"deeper construct\". The difference is it just got put into writing and was talked about against a more technologically advanced society. \n\n>Who seriously thinks that men during the Paleolithic era, who lived for no longer than thirty years, stopped trying to mate with new women as soon as they touched his first virgin.\n\nYou have to remember, people didn't take showers often, wear deodorant, or any of that usual grooming stuff. They were dirty savages.\n\n>Where do you think the term \"alpha\" originates?\n As it comes to biology, it didn't come to use until the 20th century by a biologist studying wolves, but even he redacted the concept of alpha wolf in favor of the concept that it's simply the parents that had dominance.", ">>19343950\nI know you are trying to cheer me up or give me a false hope because you know how literally everybody feels more \"clever than average\".

Of course many people who do engage in polyamory feel that not being able to build that love with someone else is a sacrifice (near) impossible to make. I also think that most everyone will encounter challenges in long term relationships, not even limited to love. I do get your point, but for most people it's already difficult to question themselves and wonder if that person is right if a friend or a family member accuses them of certain recurring behavior or faults of character, rather than stewing in anger (\"they're one to talk, they-\") or making excuses for themselves. With that in mind I think if you are willing to continuously reflect on yourself and work on your blind spots, you are doing well. In comparison I don't think a choice for any particular sort of lifestyle is as meaningful in terms of self-development, imo it's more of an attitude and openness of mind.\n\nAnother thing I did not mention because I don't feel it's an inherent part of polyamory, but is relevant, is that multiple pieces/thinkers I've read defending it mention how you can \"combine\" traits or dynamics of different people. I can definitely see how that could be valuable, but at the same time I feel like the big challenge of love is accepting someone fully as is. And accepting that most everyone will drive you insane with some of their habits/faults you cannot understand or be patient with. I feel there's a danger in polyamory of taking a sort of consumerist attitude where you pick and mix, and if you fight with lover A you can get consoled by lover B, which gets in the way of true emotional intimacy because there's no real surrender, no real willingness to take in 100% of them. But again I understand that's in no way part of the philosophy of polyamory itself.", ">>19344773\n>links\nPaternal, not parental. Obviously the tribe knew which women were the mothers of such and such child, since they saw the child exit her. It takes months for a pregnant woman to show that she's pregnant. You got to have the concept of fatherhood engraved in your mind, before you can start looking for it. The children belonged to the tribe, not individual fathers.\n\n>I'm not even sure why you think this is at all a valid point.\nShit testing is inherently biological. It's women's way of determining the values and virtues of men competing for the same female. But it doesn't stop as soon as you mate. It continues, because women need to reassure themselves that they keep choosing the right man. If monogamy was biological, there wouldn't be any need for this part of courtship. If you stop courting your lady, she'll respond a lot quicker to other males' advances. \n\n>That's mostly because most of our historical facts come from pottery and writing which were by and large invented after agriculture.\nWhat are cave drawings. What are stone axes. You do realize the Paleolithic lasted from about 2.6 million years ago, until 10,000 before present?

One of the main reasons I've chosen my primary, is because she sits through the fight, whenever it occurs. There's no running away, no shutting off or down, no silent treatment, we both continuously stay with each other until the issue is resolved, and it's beautiful. A quality not many women before her had shown.\n\nI do sympathize with the part about different qualities filling the blanks, but I don't see this as inherent to poly relationship. I read somewhere that the idea of \"soulmates\" is linked to this idea, and that you will whether you want to or not, find a place in your life for all the qualities you look for in other people, but it'll either manifest in the one, or in many (not romantic). If you do wish to find it in the one, but can't, it's most likely due to how you associate being with just one person (this might be explained with failed previous relationships, becoming jaded towards the idea of one partner,) or even how you associate with romance in and of itself.\n\nPersonally I don't have any issues with being romantic/sexual with just one person, I simply don't think it's a good idea, based on how I tend to neglect my work, and focus too much on my partner, in my previous relationships (twice monogamous, for most of my twenties.) By setting the premise, I get to spend a lot of time figuring out whether I indeed do want to spend my life with my current partner. I don't need to practice being open, but in principle I don't think it would make me the best partner possible. It's too easy to become boring further down the line, once I now how predictable and safe it is to just stay inside with the same person. In principle, I can fuck as many women as I want, but I can gladly go months without, if I get to develop and discover my relationship to my primary in interesting ways", ">>19344965\n>First of all, I would never do that.\nWell, I was talking about the concept, and as I mentioned I do understand that even apart from your personal outlook it's not inherently part of polyamory at all. But I think it can kind of creep up on you. If I take a less straightforward example, say there's partner A and B, and partner A suddenly feels a lot less desire for sex with you. You talk about it a lot, A says it has nothing to do with you and she doesn't know where it comes from. But, being human, you still can't help but feel less desirable and wanted. In a monogamous relationship, that would be an issue. You might tiptoe around it to spare your partner's feelings, but eventually chances are the bomb will burst and your hurt feelings will come out.\nIf you have a second partner, I feel it's easy to rationalize not expressing those feelings, because you feel that partner A has the right to feel less sexual for a while and that it might be construed as guilt tripping or unnecessary burdening if you unload on her. And if your sex life with partner B is flourishing, in time you might not even feel any desire to tell partner A, because you have a little more distance and focus sexually on B for the time being, happy to wait until A rekindles her sexual spark. \nThis might seem good short term, but I think it can very much be detrimental in the long haul, because by spreading risk and shopping around with emotional needs (fulfilling an emotional void from A with B), you also water down the intensity of the one on one love.\n\nI understand it doesn't have to be this way, but I can't read about people advocating how fun it is to both be with a partner who's x or makes them feel y and with a partner for who it's the other way around, and think of scenarios like this as the other side of the medal.", ">>19345042\nNot to sound accusative because you seem like a nice and thoughtful person, but the very fact that you set the premise this way now to avoid an issue you had in monogamous relationships and apparently couldn't work out in those, sounds to me like avoiding the problem artificially instead of tackling it head on. And sometimes a move like that is simply necessary because it saves a lot of time or it was not possible to take the path of most resistance and break your pattern through that. But it does play into what I was trying to get at, that it allows you more ways to walk away from any issue with intimacy.", ">>19345042\nI don't really know what to say. I feel you would be a good partner to be in a relationship with, no homo.\nI think you might be thinking somewhat mechanical about some aspects. If I'm in a relationship with A, whether or not there's a B, I'll be facing challenges as a partner, not isolated from her. If her libido falls, I'll take it as a challenge to get it back up. That means building attraction with her, just like I would any women I was dating. My current primary does in fact have some issues with sex. That does not push me to see my mistress more, because it has nothing to do with the relationship I got with her.", ">>19345115\nHaha it's all good, I'm actually a woman so no homo need not apply. I can definitely be a pain in the ass in my own way but I like to think I'm at least a good partner in the sense that I bring my A game and will think anything over once before dismissing it entirely, even if that's afterwards by myself sometimes.\n\nI think perhaps I should've stressed more that I don't think what I describe is unavoidable in any way, rather that it's a risk and that depending on the kind of person in the relationship, they might not realize straight away that the problem solving that seems efficient at first can cause issues that are less clear. Basically I think for a LOT of people it's a challenge to really open up emotionally and allow themselves to be hurt. E.g. a lot of what people call \"shit tests\" on here to me just reads like a poor response to insecurity issues they feel too vulnerable about to just share without sugarcoating anything. And I think that if you take a whole bunch of people with multiple partners, a good amount of them will at least be very tempted to use those several partners to bring the emotional risk (and with that intimacy) down. Like a more extreme version of how some people run to family/friends to get people on their side for a relationship argument.\n\nBut being aware of that is the first step and again, I don't think this is bound to happen. It sounds like you have a good thing going on and I'm definitely not against polyamory. I think for some people the challenges it poses and benefits it reaps far outweigh the total package of monogamy.

Closet bisexuals fall into this too. 3rd is those who find sex gross. Sweaty, smelly, sticky, and sometimes hairy all describe sex then there's the cleanup afterward. Semen has a strong smell and we've all had a whiff of tuna cunt before. If you think about it logically the few minutes of feel good after sex don't outweigh the nastiness of the deed itself to this branch of asexuals. 4th is those with a hormonal imbalance be it from birth control, depression, medication, diet, or whatever else. They have a sex drive but it's repressed by something else and thus sex isn't even a thought until they get balanced again. 5th type is those with a very low libido who are fine with masturbation and aren't interested in getting off to/with/in/on another person. They still enjoy getting off but it's such a low priority desire they don't give a fuck but once every few weeks. 6th is those who genuinely are not interested in sex, and this is the most rare category.
