I've been unattractive in all manner of ways, from being way too skinny and janky, to balooning over 100lbs in a years time, awkward clothing styles and being basically unaware how clothes are supposed to look and fit. The last few years I've been good to myself and have corrected a lot of my issues, I'm (what feels uncharacteristically) confident in my appearance and my ability to draw attention from those I desire. \n\nThis thread is not about me, but is instead about others desire for attention. Every human needs attention on some level, some more than others, but ultimately receiving true, honest positive attention is a psychological necessity. Knowing this, plus the amount of time I've spent suffering because of my lack of receiving attention from those I find attractive, has led me to NEVER focus on those I find attractive, but instead give my attention to the person who \"needs\" it the most. \n\nAn example: I'm talking to someone of the opposite sex, and a third comes to join the mix. The third is clearly more attractive, not in a objective way but purely subjective, and I start to shift my focus. At first glance back to the person I was originally talking to, theres this sad look of \"Is it my turn? Can I have attention? Am I good enough?\" at worst, the person who clearly needs the attention more will act out this need, and start making (mostly subconsious) shitty attention grabbing moves. Its subtle, but its definately a battle. The more insecure will do a dance, and I feel SO FUCKING BAD for them, because they need attention and I have it and I know their pain, so I give it. \n\nBut That just leads me to hanging out and interacting with sad fucks and not people that I actually want to interact with.\n\nI wish I could spell this out clearer.

There's no difference at that level without negotiation of the initial charges because the court costs and fines are static numbers rather than sentencing guidelines. So it is always a positive strategy even if you know you SHOULD get rekt to plead innocent on the chance that the prosecution is not prepared or able to actually get you rekt.\n\nPleading guilty is a strategy for negotiating down charges in an actual criminal court, such as pleading guilty to negligent homicide versus murder. This cannot be done when there isn't actually a lesser charge to plead to. Even the mere suggestion that the prosecution at the municipal level would agree to that is indicative that they don't actually have the ability to prove any part of their case because proving 10 over the speed limit is functionally the same as proving 30 over the limit. There isn't a different technology at 30+ over the limit that you can argue is less accurate than the technology used at 10+ over the limit. They either can prove you were going 30+ and don't need to make a deal with you at all or they can't prove it at all and want you to please just plead guilty to SOMETHING to justify the time in court.\n\nSo rather than being a positive tool for someone seeking reduced charges in the face of an expensive jury trial, at the municipal level plea negotiation is more often just used to guarantee conviction where it likely wouldn't happen at all."]}, "19088709": {"op": {"timestamp": 1514500135, "title": "Through a religious lens", "comment": "I am starting a new show through my local tv station.\nIt will have holy men from various religions answering questions through that religious lens and then explaining why it was answered that way. \nI'm wondering if this is A) a good idea B) if you guys could ask some general questions to help the show start off? \nI intend for this to have as little bias as possible towards any one system of belief."}, "replies": [">>19088709\nAsk them what they think about Palestinian land being occupied by Jews.", ">>19088712\nI'm going to try and stay away from political questions, but I could ask about how conflict is resolved within their own systems of belief?"]}, "19088154": {"op": {"timestamp": 1514488551, "title": null, "comment": "Is it possible to get a husband who looks like this when you're a trap top, soiboys?"}, "replies": ["Yes", ">>19088154\nYou ask this question every week, and the answer is no every week.

I grew up being bullied and ridiculed for my appearance and mental state. I was ugly and stupid, I mean the real fucking usual suspect. That kind of sculpted me into this insecure introverted and illiterate NEET. I grew tired of being belittled and treated like the frivolous cunt that I was; so, I decided I would try out new things in an attempt to improve my overall status in life. Being isolated from the people I wanted to be associated with led me to go on my own path of being productive and finding my own kind of people - people like me. \n\n2. Just to give an example of a hobby I normally wasn't fond of: motorcycle riding was something I really thought nothing of until I randomly decided I wanted to try it out since it was something different from my usual preference. When I started riding my bike I fell in love. I'm not bike enthusiast, but god do I love riding and the thrill of it. A result of taking interest in such a unlikely (for me) hobby led me to discover an entire community of riders who enjoy the same thing as I among other things: friends. I made friends who motivated me and pushed me to do things that eventually led me to digging out of the NEET grave and making something of myself. I ended up going to school and getting a job in retail - in taking on these new responsibilities I slowly begin to meet to people with different and foreign interests that led me to discovering new interests and new communities. It's like a domino effect of friendship and support. \n\nTL;DR: I was a loser that decided I didn't want to be called a \"nobody\" anymore and so I sparked a fire that resulted with spectacular fireworks (i.e. life became better).

I personally do not have any issue over the amount that I drink. Fine wine, beer, and liquor are some of the things I enjoy most in life, and I feel that they greatly increase my enjoyment of it.

Go on as you have been doing. Your job is to educate, not to hold their hands; and part of their job is to grow up and function as independent adults.\n\n2. Go all 60s flower child with them, becoming their bud, never imposing any discipline on them, and handing out As freely\n\n3. Loosen up just a little. Learn to read the students a little better and deal with them with an eye on their needs. Many won't want anything from you but lectures and grades. Some will want a little more fatherly warmth, at least in one-to-one office encounters. Stretch yourself just a little in that direction.\n\nChoice 1 will guarantee that a small number of students, often the weakest ones, will dislike and resent you. But the better ones will develop respect for the standards (academic and maturity) you hold them to.\n\nChoice 2 may reach those more-dependent students, but you run the risk of the good ones losing respect for you. (In my undergrad days, the worst condemnation we could give of a professor was not that he was dull, but that he was \"just a performer\")\n\nThere are some among us, and I envy them, who seem somehow to be able to reach all students.

This worked because the school was very big and impersonal. However, I feel that at this school I'm expected to be the type of teacher in #2 since it is much smaller, and we just cant afford to have too many students drop out due to the small size. This is part of what is discouraging to me, because if I have to be the teacher of type #2, then I think this isn't a good fit for me. It might sound like I'm lazy, but if I wanted to hold the students hand through school I would teach highschool.\n\nI'm not really sure where I was headed with this, I'm starting to fall asleep. I guess my main question would be: do you think the first choice is realistic in a very small college setting?\n\nAnd I do think you have a point with loosening up, and I hope that is something that just gets better with time.\n\nFor reference: the class in question is approx. 30 students, so even though the college is small, the class is still a normal size. My other classes (sub 10 students) I have no problem with because I have the time for one-on-one help, and they are major specific courses.", ">>19076570\nOlder prof back again\n\nYou're right that a small college does want more personal-type teaching, partly because that's one reason students choose it (even if they don't fully realize it) and so you'll get a larger proportion of \"needy\" kids.\n\nYou sense that Intro-to-math is a course many students are cold to and intimidated by to begin with. I think it is incumbent on you to recognize that and adjust your methods accordingly. You can't teach those kids the same way you as a math major were taught in grad school. \n\nYour task is to find a way to make the material less intimidating while not watering it down completely - to find a way to reach the kids without prostituting your standards.\n\nFor what it's worth, I suspect that every beginning teacher, fresh out of the heady realms of grad school, starts way too high in the first couple of classes. (Looking back with embarrassment, I know I did)\n\nMaybe going a little slower in class, maybe devoting part of every third or fourth class to review and repetition, maybe the occasional joke, maybe a little more openness to questions, maybe repeated invitations for anyone having trouble to come to your office hours - some or all of these can increase your teaching effectiveness while also communicating an openness which may be the warmth they think they need."]}, "19075980": {"op": {"timestamp": 1514179913, "title": null, "comment": "Is there any hope for ugly men in this world?"}, "replies": ["No", ">>19075980\nYeah, get that money.", "sure there is. hit the gym, get buff, develop game. so there's hope in the form of improving your chances.\n\nThe odds are most guys aren't ugly, they just don't have a perfect face and are hard on themselves about it.\n\nIs there a guaranteed easy way to get a girlfriend handed to you on a platter?

I have deep conversations with my roommate which is really close to me, and I really open up and delve deep inside my character to realize it's flaws and I carry all those perspectives with me to the \"sober\" world.\nI'm not advocating weed, it's just my experience and I know many people who's experience was bad and at best helped them escape problems for a brief moment in which they found themselves with nothing but a ridiculous amount of extra calories consumed.\nBut I'm seeking your advice, do you think this is a valid way of dealing with my problems? \nOr am I just on the peak of my high inevitable slide down back to depression even worse than before?

Like the act of interacting with people becomes less of an active attempt and comes more naturally to me, but I'm still not too sure if it's really a side effect of weed.\n\nI really get what you are saying about weed being an amplifier of other issues in one's life. some issues are not easily solved just by smoking you have to face them head-on.\n\nbtw I forgot to mention - I didn't go to the psychiatrist after all, I had to cancel.

Personally I stopped going to therapy after college because I couldn't afford it, but I'm really looking forwards to getting back into therapy in a year or two when I have enough money saved up. My best advice is to start meditating and exercising and eating right. It's cliche, but it works for me. I had a full on psychotic break from drugs in college, and the only thing that brought me back was getting back on track with taking care of my body and mind. Also, all three of those things are better when you're high. \n\nI used to get that same \"afterglow\" the day after smoking. I haven't had it in a few years, I think it goes away after your tolerance reaches a certain point. \n\nMeditate!! I've tried to attach the concept of meditation and mindfulness to my smoking and it's done me a lot of good. You form a relationship with weed when you use it a lot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's great, sometimes it's toxic and you need some space. But if you're not mindful and aware of how you're feeling and how weed is affecting your thought you'll never realize when it's become bad for you. I'm not a big fan of prescription drugs, especially anti-anxiety medications. Anti-depressants are alright. I prefer weed and good habits, though for context my life is no picnic and I work every day to try to keep up those good habits. As long as it's making you happy, like really happy and not just keeping away pain, do it. That tip is for weed but also for life in general.", ">>19061521\nGoddamn that's some great insight, thanks for the effort. \nJust for clarification have you experience the use of prescription drugs? if so could you elaborate on why you are not a fan of them?\n\nMy assumption is that the basic instructions like eating well, exercising, and meditating are things known to me, and even the mental analysis, coping mechanisms and principles I'll get in a therapy session are known to me by the seeking of self improvement in videos/books.\n\nwhat will replace my natural behavior if I would go to a therapist? I got this idea that it will be as limited and slow paced as me trying to constantly help myself. that's why I got the idea that drugs will do me more good.", ">>19061570\nI would also say that knowing the things that would make me better, and applying them are two different things. While I do apply many of them like exercising, having goals, etc... I still don't apply many of them or don't apply them fully. And it brings me back to the problem that I think there is something in mind that's beyond control, or very limited control that leaves me unsatisfied. \nAnd what I'm really seeking is the filling of this void that's sucking the good things in life and turns them into negative anxiety ridden bullshit. \nThere's nothing between me and my passion and my knowledge but my mind, and my mind is a barrier that's really hard to break.", ">>19061120\n>>19061147\nPeople are going to assume you are lying btw. If you cant get by without weed then its the same as being addicted. Alcohol doesnt have any actual addictive properties but people become alcoholics by becoming dependant on it. They dont feel normal until they have a beer.\nThe fact that weed has helped you get over your depression means that you should look to getting actual antidepressants.\nYou cant just keep smoking weed every day to get by.\n>>19061294\nSmoking weed helped this dude deal with his depression and anxiety but he doesnt know if this is a healthy way to deal with his problems. Its only been a couple of months and he hasnt said if he feels fine without smoking.", ">>19061663\nI think it's too early to determine if I'm addicted, it might just be a period of using weed and I'll move on from this when I desire with no withdrawal symptoms what so ever. I just haven't even done experiencing with it for me to consider quitting. Pretty sure I'd be just fine.\n\nBut it doesn't change the fact that by feeling conflicted I seek some kind of aid to deal with my problems. Thins includes drugs of sorts because I'm an open person and willing to consider it as an option.\n\nBut why is that I have to get \"actual\" antidepressants. what is my interest in it if weed is sufficient in the same purpose, I already experienced it's side effects and figured out how it effects my life. for me taking pills is a bigger leap than marijuana that for some reason is way more controversial. \n\nIf you can explain how they really work better than weed, considering the side effects.

So I went outside, got in my car and wrote her that she should hurry up and that I'd be waiting for her outside. She responded \"No... go then\". I joked a bit that she shouldn't be pissed and if \"no\" was her last response. She said \"I'm staying here for a bit, go home\", so I wrote \"Okay\".

I was caught off guard by my instinctive revulsion at the thought of what she said - but whatever, I don't want to see or picture every single thing my friends like or do and vice versa. \n\nWhat worries me more than anything else is that she's the oldest of the two, she initiated and he was not or barely pubescent when this happened. As much as I care for my friend I know her as a strong-willed person who has difficulty accepting other people's autonomy when they stand in the way of her goals - although she knows this and one of the things I appreciate about her most is her ability to take honest criticism and actually use it to change for the better - and she can be forceful and pushy. I met her brother, I got along with him quite well, he's a sweet kid. Well-adjusted and actually quite successful for his age. She tried to talk about it with him at some point but he pushed back and suggested they'd try to forget about it. From my precarious questions it was clear to me that if she pushed him into it she was not aware of it and it was not consciously. Still I keep compulsively picturing her bossing him into it a bit and it is so unsettling.

I don't know how he experienced it and if he did feel it was assault he seemingly buried it deep as they have an active and personal bond and he did not wish to discuss it. For obvious reasons the idea that it might have actually not been 100% consensual is also my friend's worst fear and she experienced it as two dumb kids being retarded and hormonal.

I think people are minors. can't consent to sex with adults until 18 in New York right?", ">>19021957\nwhy the fuck did you come here asking for advice and then already go ahead and call the mom? god that is so infuriating", ">>19021958\nYeah New York has the romeo and juliet system so you can have sex with people up to 4 years older than you starting at age 14.", ">>19021958\nshe did report it. i think all of which you said is covered. but should she do anything else, like contacting them again? restating everything? it just feels like nothing is happening. nobody is making a move. is there ANYTHING else that can be done?\n\ni got her out of that abusive situation. i already talked to her mom as well. she sounded like a complete fucking buffoon.", ">>19021965\nnobody was even saying anything in my thread. i just did it out of anger. i had to let it out. now i know it is stupid of me. i shouldnt have done it. she seems to know stuff about me, and threatened to come at my house. but that would just be bad on her part.", ">>19021967\nOK, what is the timeline? If there is a criminal investigation, basically they are gathering evidence to see if a crime was committed and if there is any proof. they aren't going to arrest anyone without a warrant, and to get the warrant, you need evidence. they don't like to give out warrants to arrest people without cause, especially if they are hoping the case will stick. depending on the nature of the crime, they may be investigating for both the rape and some sort of child endangerment type shit, and trying to decide if they should also charge the mom.\nit's not like on the TV show where Olivia from the SVU solves the case in like 2 or 3 days and has a trial the next day. The system is as slow as molasses.\nThey also have to figure out, if they arrest the stepdad or whatever, does the child go to the father or what.", ">>19021975\nthe child is already at the fathers house. like i said in multiple messages, she is not living in the house with her mom and step dad. she is at her real dads now. \n\nshe reported the crime about 2 months ago. the police recorded her while she said every single detail. the shirt that fucking asshole ejaculated on, has been thrown away. that was probably the best evidence. \n\nthey have been searching through her messages, and computers and stuff apparently, but what the hell are they going to find there? like what are they doing? they aren't doing anything. why can't they just put this through a lie detector test or something. her word against theirs? what else could they possibly do to convict this bastard?", ">>19021133\n>I want this person, her step dad, to go to prison\nThere are a few realities to look at. Unlike media will tell you, rape is hard as hell to prove. Violent Statutory rape would get the feds involved, but months laters its unlikely theyll find enough to prove anything. \nNow in the mean time her life would be ruined by media, ostracized by her friends because theyll be afraid to interact with her, and if she loses the case (which is extremely likely due to lack of evidence) many will just call her crazy, and it will follow her for the rest of her life. When trying to get a job or if someone wants her fired theyll call her emotionally unstable and how she cried false rape. \nI say this because your best bet is to ask a lawyer first what to do if you have a friend who is a minor and was forcibly raped by an abusive parent months ago. They would give you real odds and outcomes and you can proceed from there. Also tell you what info to get. For instance before going to the police, having him put in jail to be later released and everyone on guard guaranteeing you lose the case, you could record everyone who knows about this ahead of time before their guard is up and they choose their words. I dont know the laws about recording people but this would make for a much more convincing case and way more likely the police and feds would prioritize her case. \n\ntldr ask a lawyer, say nothing to anyone about this until you do.

If you're not a super normie dumbshit, you'll eventually have this epiphany that you're having now, and realize that the easy pleasures aren't really gratifying anymore, largely because they're easy and give little in return, you want to try for something that gives you a bigger challenge and bigger reward.\n\nFirst you need to solve whatever is lacking in your life other than hobbies before you'll really feel motivated to follow up on this feeling.

There is no leagues. You are in the league that you decide you're in.

She is a human being and you are a human being. The playing field will never be even but its your responsibility to make it even. Fuck all that league shit. If you see a girl you want, go for it. None of that \"p-p-please go out with me?\" bullshit. Confidence can get you a long way.

Long hours are basically guaranteed with little overtime and depending on your area, nepotism may be a problem.

It is really, really easy to say \"why doesn't everyone just stop being a PIECE OF SHIT??\" when you don't actually have the life experience or knowledge to understand why they're behaving that way, and what actions would actually be necessary to change that in a meaningful way.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should give up your desire to change things. It just means you should give up your childish, judgmental cynicism, make yourself willing to learn the specifics of why things are the way they are. It will take a lifetime of hard work and dedication to positively change one small corner of the world, not two paragraphs of meaningless fluff on 4chan. And that's one of the best things you could do with your life, but you'll never do it if you're not willing to open your mind and live in reality with the rest of us.", ">>18932636\nIt was just vague enough to get your attention.

Our current condition is the way that it is because of us. It's the choices we make and the things that we care about that ultimately get manifsited into physical reality. Why are third world countries exploited for their resources? Because the Devils running this world care more about $$$ than helping people. If we wanted to we could end world hunger. We could end all wars, etc. I know that sounds childish and over simplified but again, you can't expect me to write pages and pages on a bird like 4chan, but hopefully I can inspire or plant seeds in people's brains to do theirs own research and open their minds to the reality of things.", ">>18932656\nOnce again, you've written two paragraphs of generic nothingness.

I don't eat meat, not to stroke my ego or to get high on my moral superiority, but because I know I'm commiting an act of wrong doing to a sentient being. I don't steal from people because their property does not belong to me and I have no right to take what isn't mine. I believe in defending myself and if necessary killing someone to defend myself but I do not advocate violence since violence is an act of aggression. I also am currently working on a seminar in which I'll discuss topics ranging from natural law, to the etymology of words and their intended meaning, the trivium methodology of learning, and the problems facing humanity and how to solve them.\nIt's not an easy thing to assemble and it's very time consuming, and like every other human being on the planet I have my bad days and get more worked up than perhaps is necessary but answer me honestly, minus the frustration behind my words have I said anything that isn't true?", ">>18932656\n>If we wanted to we could end world hunger.

Knowledge is meant to be shared so that humanity as a whole in on level playing ground.

If you know better you have to do better.\n\n\"Knowledge is power, but knowledge shared is power lost\" \n\nIf a small group of people have knowledge that the rest of us don't have, can you imagine how easy it is to manipulate the masses through their nesience? \nThe worst is when people know better and IGNORE the information because of how it makes them feel, or because it's just more convenient to look the other way.", ">>18932605\nYou sound like you'd be able to be the one pulling the strings and not caring about the peasants.

You're making empty statements on 4chan.\n>We could end all wars\nDo you really believe that? How? All wars don't begin in the same way. Short of exercising threatening, dictatorial control and MIND CONTROL around the globe, \"ending violence forever\" is not a thing. This is a facet of human nature.

Peace is a full-time job.\n>Why are third world countries exploited for their resources?\nBecause the resources are actually needed. Sometimes, the purchase of those resources IS exploitative, but not always. Sometimes, it's a major source of income and work for a region that desperately needs it, and if we stopped \"exploiting\" them they'd be worse off. Again, it's case-by-case. Changing this in a meaningful way means identifying the companies and individuals that ARE engaging in corrupt or predatory business practices, and pushing for change through legal means. Which, once again, is a full-time job.\n\nAre you getting it yet? Do you understand the difference between talk and action?

In a way, it's comforting to believe there's just a small handful of greedy \"illuminati\" pulling the strings, because that would mean that someone is actually in control of all this shit, and it's just a few people that need to change their minds and be nice, or be removed from power.\n\nIn reality, nobody is control, the world seems like a mess because it IS a mess of billions of people competing for their own goals. Like \"ending world hunger\" isn't as simple as \"stop being greedy, fat-cats,\" you have to find ways transport food to people who need it before it rots or spoils, you usually have to find a way to work around corrupt local third-world governments and gangs who try to seize it and stockpile it for themselves, etc.", ">>18933013\nThat poster wasn't even me, but:\n>Also there is no human nature, only human condition.

I can't take you on point-by-point, because for the most part, you're actually not making points. If you have a real idea there, APPLY it to something specific to demonstrate how that's actually supposed to be helpful. \n\nAs in - I would say that \"violence is a facet of human nature\" because it often seems to be the quickest, most direct way to end a conflict and get what you want. So a lot of people choose that option because they're too shortsighted to imagine the long-term consequences, or too unempathetic to care that they'll have to hurt a lot more people to maintain their upper hand. That's been going on since the dawn of humanity, anyone with a functioning body can commit violence if they want to, so \"ending war forever\" is kind of a pipe dream. Stopping a specific war can be done, but again, it requires hard work and specific knowledge of the conflict.\n\nIt's nice to believe you can change minds with empty philosophical shit like this, but real change is grounded in specific details.

He can guarantee with 100% effectiveness this will work but will require some years' work to attend all the necessary precautions and preparations.\n\nScientist 2 proposes we have done no scientific research on this landmass. While we cannot guarantee results, there is great possibility (as with anything) of radical, field-changing discoveries but once we sever the landmass, we've lost our chance to research them.

She has bipolar disorder and major depression as well as back pain from a previous surgery (Her ex-boyfriend pushed her down a flight of stairs) so she is constantly miserable and requires a lot of maintenance.

She has more traditional conservative values about love, sex, and relationships whereas I am more open-minded. She doesn't satisfy me sexually, and our sex tends to be very vanilla if and when we do have it. I don't feel physically attracted to her anymore either which may have to do with my emotional detachment as well.\n\nI have found myself fantasizing about being single again and being able to be with other people even going so far as to fantasize about her dying. \n\nThe hardest part is that I still love her as a person and don't want to hurt her but I don't feel that it is fair to her for me to stay in the relationship for her sake when I'm not committed and invested.

Probably not thought, because men don't pull that shit.\n\nWhen he says stuff like \"it was just a meaningless facebook stalk\"\n\nYou either believe him or you don't. If you don't believe him, then there's no trust there.\n\nIf there's no trust in the relationship then you need to build trust or leave the relationship.\n\nBuild trust by making dates and making an effort to do things together. Little by little ask each other to do small things or jobs.\n\nIt starts off with say, ask him to mow the lawn. Ask him to make a dinner. Do relationship stuff, that is how trust is built.\n\nSo then when he casually says \"meh i was just stalking her page to see if her ass is still big\", you don't have to be paranoid about it because you can see the work he's putting into the relationship.\n\nIf he's jerking off to her ass, in my opinion that's a bit much, but believe it or not there are couples out there that do more fucked up shit that requires far more trust than what your relationship requires atm.\n\nIf every time he looks at a girl or woman sends you into an irrational fury or pity party, think about every time you look at another guy, or simply discuss another guy with friends, etc.\n\nIf you genuinely only ever see him, never so much as have a thought about even a male celebrity, or a male friend, or w.e. I would strongly suggest dating a fedora.", ">>18874598\nI'm not happy in my relationship and at this stage I don't see myself marrying him or having a family with him.\n\nOutside of our issues though we have shit in common and get along well, which makes it hard to leave.", ">>18874616\nno offense you can always find someone else that you have stuff in common with and get along well because from my perspective, you don\u2019t trust and you said you weren\u2019t happy so what\u2019s the point of making both of you miserable? sometimes relationships need to end, it\u2019s not an end all be all type thing because you will find someone who\u2019s better suited for you", ">>18874561\n>I lost my virginity to him\n>He made out with another chick a week later\n>He continued fucking both of us\n\nIt kind of became a competition on who could get him.

It was kind of ambiguous who he was more attracted to.", ">>18874616\n>we have shit in common and get along well\nYou mean except for the disrespect? Why waste any more of your life.", ">>18874624\nNah thanks man.

I don't trust him to meaninglessly fb stalk this particular girl bc they've had sex before. However, I would trust him if he said he was fb stalking other people. I wouldn't care so much if he was looking at girls he hadn't fucked around with in the past.", ">>18874367\nIt doesn't matter what we classify as cheating, it's about whether or not OP thinks it's cheating because they're the ones being hurt by this shit. I personally don't think looking at pictures of exes are cheating exactly, but it's definitely not something you should be doing if you're currently in a relationship and to a certain extent it isn't really healthy to be doing even if you're not in a relationship (stalking, being hung up on someone from your past, etc).\n\nThere are some people who consider watching porn as cheating and view the action as if you fucked another person. There are people who think just talking to someone of the opposite gender is \"cheating\" so it really it comes down to the person and their views.\n\nOnce again I don't think it's cheating but I don't think someone should be doing it because it would hurt their bf/gf if they found out.", "hmm really makes me think", ">>18874738\nI wouldn't classify looking at photos as cheating. Unless my partner was actively sending/receiving them.\n\nObviously I'm still really fucking hurt that he'd actively look at photos of his ex-fuckbuddy though. I agree with you that it's not something he should be doing. It indicates to me that he's not interested in me and/or he doesn't really care if I get hurt.", ">>18874742\nWhat are you thinking about anon?", ">>18874684\n\nIn that case you need to sit down and talk about why he still feels the need to check her out. Maybe they had a very long relationship, maybe something happened in her family recently. Dating when you're older you naturally have to accept that other people are going to have possibly been very attached to other people at other points in their lives, and might look back fondly.\n\nIf he's checking her out because he feels he missed out, then he needs to wake the fuck up and appreciate what he has but if he's just being nostalgic there's nothing to worry about if you trust that he's really only interested in you. He might look at other girls, other friends, etc the same way.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't tolerate the ass pic, but I wouldn't be overly harsh about it either. Most guys are like that. Have him make it up to you, and have him explicitly promise not to do it again because it makes you feel bad or not appreciated.\n\nIf he's not interested in keeping you happy, then really I don't see why you'd stay with someone that doesn't want to make you happy and you're constantly upset with. Sounds exhausting to me chasing someone's affection like that.\n\nToday it's neglecting you, tomorrow it's neglecting his kids and you trying to juggle that. Good luck", ">>18874774\nWell that's all that really matters. Next time when you confront him you need to be very specific about telling him \"you DO NOT want him doing this thing\". It's easy to just confront someone and asking them if they did x or y but if you never actually tell them that you don't want them doing x and why x bothers you you aren't going to get anywhere and the communication will just get worse.\n\nI personally had to deal with something similar in that she wanted me to delete all pictures of any girls or exes, which I agreed to but then I found out later down the line she had a dropbox with pictures of her exes. Sure there were other vacation pictures and just a huge bulk of shit but she still kept them even after asking me to delete mine which really made me feel a way about her and the whole situation.", ">>18874804\nThey fucked for like 6 months (((as far as I know))). Either way it doesn't excuse the fact that he was looking at photos of her from back when they were having sex. \n\nHe shouldn't be nostalgic about her bc he has me now and I make an effort to meet all of his needs as much as I can as a gf.\n\nI didn't tolerate the ass pic and he knows that. Yet he's back looking at fb photos of her. He hasn't really made it up to me at all. Like I thought maybe he'd take me out to an expensive restaurant, apologise for how much he fucked up by keeping the photo. But no, nothing like that.\n\nYour last line really hits home. I was the kid of a situation like that. My mum did all the work. I don't want history to repeat itself.", ">>18874825\nFuck that's rough anon. Did you regret deleting the photos of your exes and other girls?\n\nI've already tried being specific with him btw.", ">>18874847\n\nI went to a school where I was friends with kids whose parents were very on top of things. They were well adjusted, got reasonably above average grades, and didn't get into very serious relationships so young. I would call them upper-middle class.\n\nAll had parents that were also, surprise, well adjusted people. Every marriage is difficult, and hell sometimes a complete sham. However having a competent partner makes all the difference.\n\nI also went to the army for a period of time and I've met many people who have serious, serious problems from all levels of society.\n\nIf I was young, and had choices, I would choose to take my time and meet someone that I know would be a good partner instead of tying myself to someone at 23 that I was iffy on. Men it's kind of a different deal, but if you really are a young good looking 23 year old I don't think I need to tell you that there are options.\n\nIf he really gives a shit about you, he'll show it. If not, I would take my time and shop around.", ">>18874862\nNo I didn't regret deleting them but it's just something that I'm glad happened because it opened my eyes to other bullshit she does. Another example would be asking me to delete all the females I had on SC while keeping all these dudes she had on SC. All you can do is bring it up with him and let him know and if nothing changes then just cut your losses and be done with it. At the very least, just like me, you'll have more than one situation or issue to bring up when you decide you've tried and that you're finally done. Hopefully it won't come to that if you guys have been dating for that long but I can tell you from experience that holding in pain or things that bother you will just make you grow to resent and hate that person and not only will it kill you from the inside out but it'll still kill your relationship, so you're better off just ending it than sitting through the torture of holding shit in, especially when the outcome of breaking up will be the same.", ">>18874894\nI don't get your first few lines there. Are you saying that your school friends were well adjusted and got good grades bc their parents were in good relationships?\n\nThanks again for the advice though.", "I'm a guy and I think you should leave. You gave him several chances.", ">>18874937\nThanks man.\n\nI only asked if you regretted deleting the photos bc I was wondering whether my bf regrets deleting the ass photo he had on his computer. It gives me hope that irrespective of your shitty double standards gf you still didn't regret deleting the photos of your exes, etc.\n\nThanks again for the advice man.", ">>18874945\nThanks for the advice anon.", ">>18874939\n\nYes. Bad parenting ends up affecting everything in truth. Bad parenting and shitty relationships strongly correlate.\n\nSure sometimes you can have well adjusted successful people that happen to be incompetent parents, but it's very rare that their family life is abusive or neglectful. You can correct small mistakes, but you can't correct abuse and neglect.\n\nAll kids go through a rough point with being teenagers to some degree, but parenting you can see the affects and behavioral problems modelled onto their kids well into their 30s and 40s with anti social behavior disorders. This is how you end up with serious abuses and neglect.\n\nThe only reason women ever chased men in the past was for wealth and social status. Frankly, wealth isn't that important these days and honestly social status isn't really either.\n\nIf you want your kids to be happy and healthy, find a guy who looks after you, makes a modest amount of money that keeps him working hard, and doesn't put himself first.\n\nAnyway, g2g meeting a friend. Good luck and if you do part ways, take your time and find someone right for you. In the future you won't have the luxury of waiting 4-5 years to meet the right person.", ">>18874437\nI'd still fuck my ex, doesn't mean I'm going to try. It didn't work out and I know better.
