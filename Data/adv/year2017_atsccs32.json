It's a lot more complicated then i though but here it goes. This \"neighbor\", we'll call him 'JAY'. His wife, we'll call her 'EMILY'. We live in the 2nd floor, there is 5 rooms. I take 2 and they take 2 rooms. The last room being the biggest and also being the living room, is shared. By the way I'm male, 18 \n\nSo this started i while ago, I had been in the kitchen preparing and cooking food. JAY had been watching soccer on the sofa like a pathetic loser that he is. I say this because of the things he does. It'll be explained later on in the story.\n\nEMILY, struggling to lift big ass bags of laundry. While dumbass JAY just continued to keep on watching his stupid game. I mean i get it he likes soccer but for the love of god, EMILY needs help! Time passed by and i would see this same mistake being repeated over and over. In the most small or big tasks EMILY needed help with, idiot JAY would act like a dumbass pretending he didn't see she needed help. He couldn't cook, not even microwave, or heat water for cup ramen. He'd just wait till EMILY came home and she prepare the food. He worked but she would as well, and i think it hurt his pride. Not because EMILY was suffering working, but because i guess he saw himself as the man of the house. I'm guessing he tought himself as a macho man who tought a woman working was bad. She in the other hand was just trying to make a living. Every time i saw this, her being helpless, i would get a hard on. Something about EMILY just looking the way she did, would get my dick hard. I felt for her. \n\nEvery time she stayed home I would play out scenario's in my mind, I wanted to fuck her so bad. I thought about asking her a favor when she was busy cleaning, back facing me and she bent over. Then as i ask her a question. She turns over, faces me. I have my dick pulled out.

For one thing she rejected you and it is in her own best interests to not change her mind - it's pretty awkward having to tell someone you shot down that on second thought, they're actually not that bad. So there is no real incentive for her to go back on her decision unless she REALLY starts to like you. The chance that she does, out of the blue, when she knows who you are and you have an established dynamic is also slim. Once you have an impression of someone that's typically fairly consistent. This is why in the situations where someone changes their mind, there is often a relatively extreme change - like the person vying for your attention suddenly not being available anymore, or not having seen each other in years, or a traumatic event in your life in general. It is not that common for people to look at someone \"with new eyes\". You are not just someone she has written off as a dating option, she has also known you as a readily available suitor which in general is not as exciting or appealing as admiring someone without being sure. That's emotional risk for you.\n\nBasically making yourself even more available by asking her out again is unlikely to work. It is more likely that she might change her mind if she sees that you continue living your life and interacting with other women than if you keep hanging around her. And even if it wasn't I'd recommend doing this because zoning in on a woman who is not interested in you romantically over time will break your spirit and any confidence you have.

This is still disregarding poor sex ed in so many places that would make it horrifyingly unclear to women what exactly can and cannot get them pregnant. \n\nThe result was that there was a cultural understanding that women were going to be reluctant without it necessarily saying anything about her feelings or level of desire.

Make her comfortable first with showing off for you privately in the bedroom. Then once that's your normal you can tell her you in general like clothes that show off her body more.

And that it means something else in 2017 when a girl crudely brushes off your attention than it did in 1957. It no longer reflects real dangers or what's normal culturally, but her personal feelings. And that is insulting. Think of the difference between a girl not wanting to have sex with you despite dating you because she believes sex before marriage is a sin, or her simply not wanting to. End result is the same but emotionally it is wildly different.\n\nThat's not to say the current dating scene is ideal but honestly it didn't use to be ideal either. This is actually a more conservative time (not just in terms of average sex partners and age you first have sex, but also in terms of how accepted controversial sex acts like gangbangs and pedophile shit are) than some of the decades before. The realization that porn isn't just harmless fun fantasies is relatively new, as is the realization that after the sexual revolution we have to conclude that sex is not just about pleasure, fun and love but also about power, danger and coping mechanisms.

I stupidly made a comment on how he'd fall for her, because I wanted his validation instead, or him telling me he doesn't care about other girls just me and I'm prettier than her, but instead he just got pissed, ignored me completely and then after a while told me \"I don't want to be loving when I'm pissed off. I'm not in the mood. I'm not going to reward your behavior by telling you you look good\" and he made me feel a thousand times worse because he knows this bothers me so much, but he just gets super annoyed.

But even if I try my hardest to suppress these feelings I know they're always there. I need to get better because I don't want him to be unhappy with me.

If you want to have a spoiled brat as a partner, sure, but don't go around telling others to act like you are just because you're too scared of upsetting your girlfriend and would rather get upset yourself and hide it, while letting her do stupid shit that might get her in trouble.", ">>18808891\nI bet you make a great boyfriend. People make mistakes, it doesn't help to tear them (or yourself) up about it. You let it go, and help them learn from the mistake.\nAnd I probably didn't convey my story well. I didn't hide it or bottle it up, I just let the anger go with a sigh.", ">>18808926\nNot him, but...\n\n>Never show negative emotions to your girlfriend\n\n...is extreme and sounds super unhealthy. Just because you're in a relationship with someone doesn't mean you're not allowed to be angry or annoyed by things they do. Sure, it's good to be able to let things go, but it's a big problem to pathologically avoid conflict/anger.", ">>18808926\nYes, they make mistakes and that's why it's important to call them out on it and show them it's not OK. If they can get away with making mistakes they're going to repeat them, they need to be reminded that actions have consequences.\n\nYeah, of course you have to let it go, you're not going to stay mad at someone for a mistake their entire life, but acting like it never happened is equally stupid.", "My ex was sort of like this.\n\nAll I wanted to do was watch a fucking movie and cuddle. But it was always:\n\n>let me brush my teeth first\n>let me finish this buzzfeed quiz\n>let me finish messaging so and so\n\nIt always turned into a 1 hour shitfest where I sat there pissed off. And im the bad guy in this situation? Never once did I get visibally pissed off. Just brought it up once.\n\nFucking women.", ">>18808944\n>Sure, it's good to be able to let things go, but it's a big problem to pathologically avoid conflict/anger.\nThere are different ways to deal with anger than to cause conflict. That fact that you equate and conflict probably means that you aren't good at dealing with your anger without conflict.\nFor example in OP's case, if he is angry at his girlfriend, why not ask her to do something for him? Ask for a cake or blowjob or something so you can stop being mad at your girlfriend. My girlfriend understood she had screwed up, and was all over me all the way to the hotel we stayed at apologizing. I sort of mulled it over in my head, half of me wanted to slap her when I saw her but the other half knew that wouldn't help. If I had gone the other way it mighta turned in to a huge argument.\nAs a man, you have different outlets for anger than straight communication. As a man, you are expected to use those outlets. Failing that, talk to your male relations instead.", ">>18808963\nYeah, that sounds like an awful relationship built on resentment and manipulation rather than healthy communication. No thanks. You don't have to talk about everything, but if I'm understanding you properly, you're advocating never actually vocalizing any negative emotions to your girlfriend and just telling her what's what, which is retarded.", ">>18808952\n>Yes, they make mistakes and that's why it's important to call them out on it and show them it's not OK. If they can get away with making mistakes they're going to repeat them, they need to be reminded that actions have consequences.\nYes, and you can do this without being angry, or really any sort of negative emotion. Like, show concern or something. \"Hey babe I was worried something was wrong. Don't do that again mmkay?.\n>\nYeah, of course you have to let it go, you're not going to stay mad at someone for a mistake their entire life, but acting like it never happened is equally stupid.\nWho said I acted like it didn't happen. My girlfriend is used to me acting sweet, so I withheld that, and it had exactly the intended effect, she responded by being extra sweet to me. If I had gotten mad she probably would of responded differently.", ">>18808971\nThen keep on communicating with your girlfriend and stopped getting pissed when communicates back that she is unhappy. Do you want advice or validation? Yeah, anyone can see your girlfriend is in the wrong. I'm sure fighting about it until she admits it too is real productive.\nYou want her to stop being late, right? That's the end goal of this for you? That makes sense, I can see why you want that. In that case, there are more productive ways to ensure that than arguing about it.\nOr do you just want her to admit she is in the wrong? That won't lead anywhere but bad and I suggest you drop that.", ">>18808974\n>Who said I acted like it didn't happen.\nIt sounded a lot like you did. Saying \"that's just the way they work\" implies that you think this kind of things are just going to happen and you can do nothing about it so you'll just put up with it.\n\n>My girlfriend is used to me acting sweet, so I withheld that\nSo you expressed your anger in a passive-aggressive way, rather than directly. I mean I can't resist calling you a faggot for it, but I acknowledge the fact that it achieves the same thing as being direct about it. It's still very manipulative and controlling, a lot more than simply yelling at her about it. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but don't pretend you have a high moral ground here.", ">>18808994\nI'm sorry, at what point did I ever say anything about \"arguing\" about anything? I talk to my girlfriend. I let her know if something she's done hurts/angers/irritates me. I'm annoyed that it seems like she's not getting a point that, as you said, seems wholly obvious, but I literally never said anything about arguing with her to get her to concede that I'm right.\n\nWhich is all still a separate issue from the one being discussed right now which is this asinine position you've taken that is \"NEVER express negative emotions to your girlfriend.\" It's like the most passive-aggressive means of conflict resolution I've ever heard.", ">>18809007\n>I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but don't pretend you have a high moral ground here\nI didn't, I don't. I think I have the better out come here, which puts me in a position to give advice (in my opinion). \n>It sounded a lot like you did. Saying \"that's just the way they work\" implies that you think this kind of things are just going to happen and you can do nothing about it so you'll just put up with it.\nIf putting up with it is the same as ignoring it to you then I guess from your point of view I am ignoring it. And I'll argue that it's better to do that than to get angry over it, if only from the fact that in my experience that's how it has gone. Feel free to disagree.\n>So you expressed your anger in a passive-aggressive way, rather than directly.\nI suppose it can be seen that way, but it wasn't motivated by anger. It was more of a logical choice because I wanted her to feel bad and make it up to me.\nI realize I am being hypocritical by arguing I did nothing and that I did something. I suppose my point boils down to control your anger rather than express it, and then manage it a different way.", ">>18809017\n>Which is all still a separate issue from the one being discussed right now which is this asinine position you've taken that is \"NEVER express negative emotions to your girlfriend.\" It's like the most passive-aggressive means of conflict resolution I've ever heard.\nIt's not even about conflict resolution, it's about conflict avoidance. Bringing up things that neither person can change just causes needless problems. I know because I've had a similar problem with my girlfriend. She wanted me to stop being so careless with my things because I was always losing them. I snapped and we ended up having a big fight about it. Looking back I realize I could of controlled that situation by being calmer.\nI don't see why you think it't such a radical position. I'm not saying never show emotion. I'm not even saying never show negative emotion. Just don't show it to your girlfriend, who subconsciously see's you as her protector and provider (or not, in which case go ahead and show negative emotion).", ">>18808870\n>\"She's unreliable when it comes to this kind of thing and I can't trust what she's telling me\"\n\nThat is ENTIRELY the wrong way to think about it and is a surefire recipe to disaster. It's more like >>18808799 said: \"The problem is she's forgetful and doesn't plan well.\"\n\nThat's like all it is if, as you say, you've have this talk multiple times and it just seems to be going nowhere.\n\nYou're making it personal and about you by taking it as \"she's careless, inconsiderate, and disrespectful of my time,\" which is making you resentful. She may just be scatterbrained, which would certainly explain her confusion as to why her behavior is an issue to begin.\n\nI say cut her some slack."]}, "18805168": {"op": {"timestamp": 1507557180, "title": "Antidepressants", "comment": "Are antidepressants worth the side effects to cure depression-induced insomnia. \n\nHow easily do counsellors at university campuses prescribe them?"}, "replies": [">>18805168\nif you get side effects, it all depends on you.

That's the least you can do, and it's probably more than what most girls (hell, most women) get.\n\nIf you would like to pursue a relationship, make sure you have a secure ways to communicate and more importantly, plausible deniability.

If you truly trusted her there would be absolutely no need to explicitly tell her she couldn't kiss her exes. That is asinine, OP.

He'd tell me I have to communicate better. and when I do he gets angry or minimizes me.

I feel like I'm not being heard and I want you to understand how I'm feeling.\" If he tries to pass off your feelings, tell him you need him to understand.

Maybe most people are simpleminded or not introspective like we are, but what about the smart people who have confronted these ideas and overcome them? \n\nDepression is a lock without a key. It traps you by letting you see the lock and examine it, see exactly how and why it works, see why you can't escape. It gives you the freedom to look for a key that doesn't exist. But in the end the lock is just a lock. It's not connected to anything. You can leave any time even though it doesn't look like you can. \nThe scary thing is grappling with the idea \"if none of those things locked up in the depression box matter (life, ethics, morality, etc.), what else is there?\" I don't know how to answer that because I'm not there yet.

He never gets anywhere in life because of this. From shooting himself in the foot in terms of self-image, to constantly studying for careers he never follows through on, he is his own worst enemy and always fucking himself over.\n\nI don't know what autism is in a literal sense, medically speaking (and no researcher seems to either), but I wish he could lose his ego and admit that he is incorrect about many things and in need of guidance. He just wants to get tism bucks and pretend he's not upset by setting his expectations in life so low. If you try to tell him he can succeed, he *wants to argue and disbelieve you.*\n\nI hate this. I resent him sometimes. Every bit of progress I make, he gets jealous and belittles me. I'm tired of playing these wit games with him. I've accepted that he'll be a Nazi weeb with characters in his head. If you try to change anyone, they might just resent you for it.\n\nHe thinks that the sole reason I participate in society is to give money to jews so that I can have sex.

When you are kissing her and rubbing her thigh you need to tread that line between giving in to your natural urges and teasing her. It's not to difficult and you'll know it's working because she'll get goosebumps and breathe heavy. Girls can sense stress and nervous movement/ rigid touching and it turns them right off. Ultimately even if you are not the most confident dude on the planet try to imagine yourself as a big cock muscular alpha. You'll.love like one and to her ( at least at that point) you may as well be one. Right now it sounds like she thinks the nervous thing is cute and she is flattered by you, maybe boosts her ego hanging with you so don't be surprised if she just recoils Though. If a girl is sexually attracted to a more dominant type you have to mask on from the start or they will know. Anyway there's still a good chance for you if your a good looking guy and you both get a bit tips. She might always just be on her rags if she pushes you back but still wants to hang.

They want YOU to be the animal. Gentle, dominant, careful, attentive animal which wont stop until they say firm NO AND PUSH YOU AWAY.

Until they use full force or firm no, KEEP PUSHING BOUNDARIES.\n\nIt is a game. Do it very slowly, carres her WHOLE body (girls have erotogenous zone practically everywhere, not just clit and boobs.

There are plenty of monks, for instance, who have no interaction with women and feel no need for it. What they do have is something much more important to them, their religion. When there exists something really important to you, something like a cause, a goal, spirituality, a person, anything really, other problems won't affect you so much (or at all) and other desires would diminish, to the point where you don't even have other desires. Of course, very few people manage to find something that important to them, but not being obsessed with the opposite sex is not THAT hard to achieve.\n\nBesides finding something important to you you should try to get the idea that you NEED a partner out of your head. The reason interaction with the opposite sex is so important to us is not only biologic, but also social. We've been taught that our natural purpose is to find a mate, we've been bombarded with romance since we were kids and with sex since we were teenagers, we've been programmed to crave it. I recommend meditation for this, understanding your thought processes is very useful if you're trying to convince yourself of something.\n\nAnd you should do these things without actually trying to \"completely abandon 3D women\".

What IS true is that women often have a less fleshed out desire for men than the other way around. For example, it's fairly common for women to not really know what they are into with men, or to have \"responsive\" attraction where they can fall for men once in the courting process but rarely notice men spontaneously.\n\nHowever this has to do with two things. The first is that women do not have nearly as much testosterone, which is the driving force behind the raging physical sex drive that typically causes young teen boys to realize just how into women they are. (And their frustration about not being able to fuck any will in turn drive them to broaden their taste as much as possible, either consciously to get laid or implicitly through exploring all sorts of porn.) \n\nWomen on the other hand do not have the same force and on top of that, sex and men are less \"special\" to them, because they hound them to begin with. For their own safety and to keep their image okay they quickly learn to shut men down and focus on the few striking men who really stand out.\nIt is very impractical if on top of the guys already options to you by living your life or their own initiative, you feel active attraction towards a whole bunch of others despite needing to be really picky about who you sleep with or else you're a cheap slut. So they tone their interest in men down as much as possible (depends on the person how much that is).", ">>18412268\nI personally do not like any shaving/trimming.

For a concrete example, look up \"responsive sex drive\".

The reality of it is that it's become a trite cliche, and more likely than causing this energy and being an ice breaker, it makes it difficult for her to talk to you like a normal person because you do not introduce yourself as a person, you introduce yourself as an interested party. It is hard to reply to a gimmick with anything other than awkwardness or dismissal. \n\nPractice as often as you can. I do NOT mean chatting up girls. I mean talking to people. Little old ladies.

There is a difference between being pleasant and being a doormat. If you have difficulty distinguishing in the beginning, ask yourself if you would still laugh at this joke if your friend made it.

If she is boring you, remove yourself and talk to someone else. \n\nAt least, this is the short term investment for the long term becoming the kind of man that women want to fuck/be with structurally.

No good can come of it.", ">>18412362\nIt's always a mental barrier to initiate, but the trick is to 100% realize and understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with reaching out to someone. What a lot of guys do is that they are really anxious about approaching a girl, so they avoid doing it most of the time. Then when they do it and the girl is not interested, they feel like the hardest part is already behind them and they have to cling on as who knows when they will dare to approach a girl again?\nIt should be the other way around. Approach lots, take rejection lightly. Those girls complaining about guys chatting them up somewhere? They aren't complaining that someone dared to acknowledge their existence in the public realm. They're complaining that they couldn't take a hint.\n\nIf a girl isn't smiling, gives curt answers, does not make eye contact or only very briefly, does not ask questions, moves physically away from you or turns away, grabs her phone or a book and so on - you can safely assume that she's not interested. No harm done. If you didn't say anything yet, ask her a plausible question (like whether she saw if x bus already came by) and play it off like that. If you did talk, just smile and wish her a good day. Done. \n\nWhat I see a lot is guys analyzing endlessly what they did \"wrong\" in approaching a girl, causing her to not be interested. Sure it is a good idea to maximize your strategy. But it does not happen in a vacuum. She might be taken. She might have a shit day and sit there trying not to cry when suddenly a stranger talks to her. She might be holding in a fart and dying to get home to shit. You have no clue at all what's happening over at her side and what context your attempt to talk to her falls into.

The best way is to comment on something you have \"in common\". Of course it's perfect if she is reading a book (from an other) you love or you can hear she's listening to music you like or whatever. In real life this likely won't happen but it does not matter. Most of the conversations I've had with strangers started because you are both watching something (like someone having a difficult time parking, a kid throwing a scene, something mildly entertaining or odd), make eye contact, and then either makes a little comment like (in the parking case) \"I'm impressed, I was really betting against him\" (or in the second case) \"at least we can go home and leave him to mom, right\". This is also why it is so incredibly common to talk about the weather - it is one of the only current events you know for a fact any other person also has some level of thoughts/opinions/feelings on. \nBut stuff like \"what are you reading/listening\", \"hey\", \"do you know what time the train will arrive\" also work. They are just less preferable if you can bank on bonding over a shared sight. \nBecause, again, the way you handle the conversation itself and her response is much more important than the way you start it. Whether she wants to talk or not will have firstly most to do with how she feels (does she feel pretty or haggard? tired or energized? sullen or vibrant? is she in a hurry or relaxed with no plans?), secondly with what she picks up from you (sure, your looks, but more than anything else: whether you seem like you might be a bit off mentally, whether you seem safe generally, whether you seem REALLY invested in talking to her or like you just want to chat) and only after those two huge ones does anything else factor in.\n\nObviously it is a lot harder to approach girls who are on the move and going about their business.

How often does she initiate? If the current situation is that she chats you up often and you do seriously like her, reciprocate from time to time. It doesn't have to be 50/50 but if she really likes you it'll likely make her insecure over time about your feelings, and most people (especially in early stages) react to that by keeping or creating their distance and shutting their own budding feelings down. \n\nIf you just enjoy talking to her but don't need anything from her beyond what you are getting now, not necessarily. In an ideal world all dynamics would be equal but in practice the brunt of friendships have one person who is typically more active in maintaining it.

There's several sides to it.\n\nFirst of all, you aren't married yet. Leaving your girlfriend because you think you would make a better fit with someone else is not something to be proud of, but what's the alternative? I know I'd rather have a guy break it off with me because he thinks he has a better shot with someone else, than stay with me out of a sense of obligation because he happened to choose to get together with me some time ago.

If you got together with this new girl, at some point she would also be old news and you would also get into a rut together. At some point the new relationship energy has run its course and it's up to you to keep the spark alive together and come out of it stronger, instead of letting everything die down because you aren't able or willing to really invest in being a good partner after the initial buzz. \n\nSo I would advise you to\n>sit down and consider honestly whether the state of your relationship has more to do with your inherent qualities, or her behavior or whatever, or that you neglected to keep the relationship healthy and took things for granted\n>consider how well you know this new girl and what reasons you have to believe that you would work better with her other than chemistry \n\nEither way, a friendship is not an option. That's entirely disrespectful towards your relationship, and part of the reason why male/female friendships get such a bad reputation is that people keep trying to treat friendship as a consolation prize.

I said no and he asked me about it, then said the answer I gave was endearing, 3) asked if I wanted to hear something funny (we'd skyped a few days before since I was house-sitting for him while he was gone, and he wanted to check in. his stepmom was around while we were talking).

I can make up to $200 bucks a day working on movie sets in LA or making small companies logos and whatever. But when there's no production team I can find, I don't have a job. Making graphic art stuff has become almost impossible when places like Fivver and UpWrite take all my business. Why pay me $30 bucks for a logo when you can pay a college student $5. I can't get a \"real\" 9-5 job because of tax reasons and also, if a production calls me out of the blue, as they do at like midnight to see if I'm available, there's never enough notice to give the real job and that becomes a big headache for everyone involved and then looks bad on me if I have to keep quitting. \n\nSo tl;dr.

It requires a permanent change, but it's not like smoking or alcohol where you can work towards never touching one thing again (since sugar and carbs are in almost everything).

Allow your natural signs of attraction to show (more eye contact (no staring), standing just a bit closer, smiling just a bit more easily when looking at her face).

Being asked by your partner to cut yourself off from your friends/all members of the opposite sex/your social life is a strong indication that you are in an emotionally abusive relationship and that your partner has serious issues with trust and control, which can potentially lead to the relationship becoming physically abusive later on.\n\nYour sister is probably blindsided by infatuation, but her relationship is clearly unhealthy. Keep trying to talk to her about it, and show her information about emotional abuse to help her realize what sort of cycle she's gotten herself stuck in.\n\nAs someone who has been in this type of relationship in the past myself, let me tell you that the best way to get your sister to really think about what's going on objectively is to avoid attacking the character of her boyfriend. Doing so would only put your sister on the defensive, and it will make her a lot less likely to take your concerns seriously if she's able to write them off as a personal vendetta against her boyfriend. Focus your conversation exclusively on the ways in which the relationship has affected her negatively.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"[Boyfriend] shouldn't be asking you to not talk to any other men; that's possessive and weird,\" say \"I noticed that you've been drifting away from [names of her other guy friends], why is that?\" If her response is \"My boyfriend told me to,\" THEN you can point out what an unreasonable request that is.", ">>18216873\nThank you for the good advice.

If I imagine that I am a man I can see hundreds of pretty girls every day. Most women look realistically similar to actresses and models. Of course, I'm talking about cities and young people without children, not obese women who I really haven't even seen in European cities. \nOn the other hand, most women don't really have a choice. Maybe one man in 10 or 20 is attractive enough just to get attention because of the looks and 40-50% of young urban men are attractive if they have a great personality. Women rarely like men for the looks only because there is nothing to look at.\nIf you don't believe me, try to look at men and women who you are passing by and evaluate them thinking you are the opposite sex. You don't really have to be gay for that. You will see that there are lots and lots of women who look like attractive actresses and models and maybe one man in a day who could be a conventionally attractive male actress and I don't even remember when I last saw the male model type. \nThere is of course makeup and style which makes women prettier but girls are way prettier than boys already in middle school where most kids don't wear makeup. And nobody is stopping guys having interesting hairstyles and clothes or using a little bit makeup, it is their choice.\nMen have always a bigger choice if they want attractive women because they can just go to a shopping centre or a club and see lots and lots of pretty women there. Women have to search for years just to see a pretty man. Of course, those women liking that men is another problem and women definitely have an advantage there but in general, realistically men have so much bigger choice that I don't even understand why women bother.

According to that logic I would like almost all women who I have met, even fat ones that have firm skin, like Lena Dunham (I don't like her personality though.) Most women are really pretty. Maybe it is because I'm from Eastern Europe where many men still have only buzzcuts and think that using face cream makes you gay while women are super pretty. It is not uncommon to see a well dressed girl wearing heels walking next to a man wearing old tracksuit but it is not extremely common either. Even in Western European cities men are more attractive but still there are not as many pretty men as women.

Socially awkward and to this day never had a girlfriend. But I've had the strongest crush on my older sister for years.\nMy mom and dad favored her and my older brother. My parents never had much time to hang out with us. But my sister who was 5 years older than me was my hero. She taught me how to play video games and ride a bike. But nothing ever sexual happened between us. I don't feel she knows about how I've been secretly in love with her for years now. In my childhood 2 incidents happen that make me feel like I was \"cuckolded\" by my sister, I'll call her Caroline.\nFirst was the most traumatic. I was 11 years old and Caroline was 16 in high school. I heard what I thought was her screaming in her bedroom one night but she really was having sex with her boyfriend. I rushed in to try and help her but the boyfriend started attacking me and beat me up. Caroline was embarrassed and yelled at me to get out of there. I never talked to her about it since but it really hurt me. It's also what started my sexual feelings towards her and unlocked a repressed memory.\nWhen I was around 9 I remember a time when I caught Caroline and my brother naked together in my brothers room. Apparently they had been showering together after going swimming. This has lead me to believe they were sleeping together. My brother was 17 at the time and Caroline was 14. He's the opposite of me an alpha male that gets all the girls. Looking back I feel jealous at my brother and the boyfriend. I feel \"cuckolded\".\nTo be clear I don't want to be cuckolded in real life but it's a fantasy I'm curious about. Why does it turn me on to be sexually teased by my sister? Is it because I'm a virgin at 26? Is it because I transferred an Oedipus complex from my mom onto Caroline but it's happening in my adult life instead of age 4 like most guys?
