It really depends on what you like, I played violin because I always enjoyed the higher pitch range that was associated with the smaller instruments. A cello and bass are lower pitch, notably the bass naturally.

The electric has frets so that you can see what note you're playing, an upright is fretless so you'll have to go by intuition and/or experience. That said you can always start with an electric and cross over to the upright with ease.\nCellos are cheaper than upright basses, but is slightly harder to learn, especially if you are going to be self-taught. Also bow technique etc. You'll also be less likely to get to play gigs with the cello if that's something you're considering.

It really depends on what you want to do. I would say cello is the least physically demanding to play, whilst double bass is the most difficult to play in tune due to the wider interval spacing and lower pitch, speaking from from my own personal playing experience. If you have a wide range of musical interests spanning classical, jazz, and Latin, then I would say double bass is a good option and would enable you to alternate easily to electric bass guitar should you wish to play funk, fusion, rock, metal, ska or any contemporary popular styles. Cello is perhaps the best if you wish to have an in depth exploration into classical repertoire, given there are more works written for cello in terms of solo, concerto and chamber repertoire than double bass, although its common practice to transcribe works such as Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata and Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations for bass.

They're always due to the same skewed perceptions. Here are my blueprints to fix most of the questions I see on here every day, and my top tips each. Everything here is stuff I've done or changed and become successful with myself.\n\n\n>Blueprint for losing weight\nAt it's simplest, this boils down to eating less calories than you spend over time.\nYou can calculate within a few % of margin of error exactly how much weight you will lose over exactly how much time if you record everything you eat and do and stick to your target daily intake.\n\n1. Count your calories- Without counting your calories you have no benchmark and can't set sensible targets. You can do this intensely for a week til you build up a picture of the amount of calories in most of the foods you eat, then benchmark once a week from then on. A good method is taking a photo of everything before you eat it on your phone then recording cals of everything at the end of the day.\n2. Don't drink calories. There's no reason to, don't do it. Milk in coffee is an exception because it's a few calories at most, otherwise don't.\n3. Eat more, not less. Studies have shown just how difficult it is for humans to change habits, in fact we fail at it 97% of the time. But we find it fairly easy to change existing habits, so cutting out food X is hard but changing food X to food Y is easy. Eat the same amount or more, but eat less calories, and you'll lose weight. This invariably means replacing processed foods with home made and eating far more vegetables. If in doubt, replace it with veg.\n4. Prioritise consistency. If you're having trouble sticking to your weight loss regime, find ways to make it easier. Slow steady progress is usually best because it's incredibly difficult to cut your daily calories by more than 30%. Slow progress is fine, you're changing your human form and your life after all."}, "replies": [">Blueprint for eating healthy\nThis is a simple one but I'm pretty much cheating because I just read a lot of stuff online and based my diet on a single page. That said, it took me a while of trying different diets and doing weird shit before I realized the famous but cliche quote of \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\u201d\n\nI now realize that that is literally all you need to do, but here's some info I found out along the way.\n\n>Meat is not bad, neither is being a vegan\n4chan is full of extremes and everyone likes to defend their edgy teenage extreme viewpoint, but the truth is that a diet high in meat and with almost zero meat CAN be healthy, if you're very careful.\nThe biggest problems with meat are that they're high in saturated fat which is known to increase arterial plaque, cholesterol, and in turn heart disease etc. Ketofags will argue the evidence for this to death, but it's been around and still growing for 60+ years, it's safe to say the WHO and NHS recommendations of less than 90g red meat per day is sensible.\nThat said, oily fish are one of the healthiest things you can eat because they're high in omega 3 and other healthy fats, iron, iodine, bioavailable calcium, and plenty more. Learn to love Mackerel, Sardines, Salmon and Herring in particular.\n\n>Food X is not unhealthy\nSugar, Alcohol, Saturated Fat etc, aren't unhealthy, they're unhealthy in large quantities. This is an important distinction because people changing their diets are particularly prone to doing batshit things like 100% cutting out foods etc.\n\n>Cut out 95% of processed foods\nThis is the only thing I tend to agree with cutting out nearly completely. Not only are they expensive but they taste like shit (you just like the salt, MSG and sugar in McDonalds, trust me) and are really bad for you. It takes 5 minutes with youtube to learn how to make your own versions of processed foods and fast foods these days, and you can make them as healthy as you like, learn skills and save cash. Do it.", ">>17668468\n>Cheat page\nThis is the cheat page I used to fix my diet. WHFoods is run by a weird commie looking guy but all the information is sourced and the studies are linked. Every food has nutrition info and food sources in order. It's a wicked site.\n\nhttp://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php\n\nIf you eat 50% of the foods on that last every month and change it up every now and then, you'll be healthy for the rest of your life. They're almost all cheap and available everywhere too.", ">Blueprint for beating depression\nThis is the most common thing I see people complain about and question here and it's one of the simplest to fix and most life changing. Depression is like obesity: it's almost exclusively the result of shitty lifestyle. There are some rare exceptions like depression as a result of traumatic experience, PTSD, etc, but for everyone on 4chan it's a result of prolonged shitty lifestyle and/or inactivity. Here's the non bullshit recipe for no depression from someone who fixed himself:\n\n>Regular sunshine\n>Regular exercise\n>Regular social interaction with peers\n>Regular altruism\n>Good diet\n>Good sleep\n\nIf you're depressed for longer than a month and haven't experienced any recent traumatic experiences then you're lacking in one or more of those areas.\n\nSunshine, exercise, social interaction and diet are or will be listed in this thread or obvious, sleep is the only one I can't give a blueprint for because I still fuck it up, but I'll potentially write some tips on stuff that's worked for me so far.\n\nSome other tips:\n\n>Meditation\nThis is cliche and most people pass it off as pointless but it takes as little as 15 minutes per day and is one of the best treatments for depression we know of, second only to exercise. It helps you stay calm and focused throughout the day and stops you from reacting like a little bitch every time something annoys you.\n\nYoutube and google can give far better info than I can in this thread, but if you're starting out set a target for 30 days of meditation at 15 minutes per day and mark an X on your calendar for every day you do it. Any time you miss one you'll feel like a cock and this will help keep you accountable.\n\n>Altruism\nUnless you're diagnosed with sociopathy, acts of altruism result in one of the single biggest dopamine releasing rewards your brain can give you. Don't just go out and give all your money to a homeless person, but look for opportunities and circumstances in life where you can genuinely..", ">>17668486\n..help people for the sake of helping them, that means no sending presents to that girl you like because you want to get down her pants.

Call me out on any bullshit, ask questions or ask for anything", ">Blueprint for everything\nChaos majick\n\nAll hail Giga Puddi", ">>17668491\nGood thread. Go on.", ">>17668446\nMODS STICKY THIS SHIT.", ">Blueprint for social interaction & getting a girl/guy\nMost people have friends early in life and slowly lose them due to lack of maintenance or don't form new friendships and become isolated over time. For others, it starts early. Either way it boils down to some very simple principles: interacting with people in casual/social settings and being interesting will form you friendships over time. Relationships are just an extension of friendship, so most of this applies to getting a girl/guy as well.\n\n>Have and attend Hobbies & Interests\nHaving hobby groups like a Photography workshop or group, origami, art or music of any kind, etc is fantastic for a number of reasons:\n\n>You're learning and improving skills and talent\n>You're creating things of value which you can later sell or use to make cash\n>You're meeting new people with similar interests\n>You're creating something you can talk about to strangers\n>You can start any time and not feel stupid or anxious about being new\n\nThe lack of barrier to entry, coupled with the plethora of regular interactions with similar people means you're pretty much guaranteed to form friendships\n\n>Learn to be vulnerable \nThis is a hard one for most guys because we're traditionally not in touch with our emotions, or like to hide them. But studies show that the most socially successful people (actors, celebrities, politicians and several other groups) are all at ease with being vulnerable and revealing potentially damaging information about themselves. What this means is communicating about how you feel with others. Girls are a lot better at it and it takes a particular time and place for guys, but it's the same deal and helps friends build deeper empathy and understanding with you.", "It's probably worth mentioning, but perspective is something that is very important. We tend to think remarkably short-term about our problems or things we want to change. Building a house or learning a language may seem very complex, but in reality languages are learnt piece-by-piece and buildings are built one brick at a time. Walking 10 kilometres may seem like a long distance (for some), but it's really just one step at a time.\n\nIt's important to realise this with anything relating to yourself. Often many people on this board state huge problems and want a large amount of changes. It's very important to break things down into smaller, more manageable chunks. People arrive saying how they've felt depressed for years and nothing works- alongside the defeatist mindset, the idea that eating a healthy meal or going for a walk will help seems stupid.\n\nA large part of most problems is not dealing with them over a period of time; depression is often caused by learning and continuing rather bad thoughts over years and years. In a similar way, you have to build your 'new' thoughts over a long period of time. It takes a lot of time, and a lot of small changes, but they add up.\n\nMore simply put; imagine you want to learn a language. Now, if you study for 15 minutes a day, in 10 years you'll have a reasonable knowledge of that language. If you don't study at all, in ten years you'll be the same level as you are now.", ">He/She doesn't like me\nThere are 2 common failure points for starting relationships\n1. You're shit at interaction.\nPeople respond to you based on how you respond to them, it's basic shit, but you still get depressed and antagonistic people on 4chan who think the other person is to blame for their rejection when asking a girl out.\nBe honest, be simple, be direct, be positive and be confident. \n\nAs with most conversations you should: Know why you're talking to someone, what you expect to get out of it (getting a relationship is not a realistic expectation from a question, finding out if someone would be interested in a relationship is, you can then move forward from there), and know roughly how you'll proceed after being rejected or accepted. ALWAYS get feedback, this will help you interact better in the future. Yes, this is a strategic and autistic/analytical way of interacting with people at first, but it's very natural when you know what you're doing. Sales people are exceptionally good at it and tend to get laid a lot more than the general populace as a result.\n\n2. You're uninteresting or not valuable\nThis is the most common answer. I'll see young males on 4chan who live at home or work shitty jobs and play video games in their spare time wondering why girls aren't interested in them.\nIt's obvious, girls tend to be pursued so don't have the problem as much, so they can be selective. Someone who is uninteresting to interact with or talk/learn about isn't top of the selection, simple as.\nDevelop skills, set long term goals, form hobbies and interests, learn to lead people in social situations, learn to talk to an audience and communicate well, read a lot and be studied, etc. These will all help you interact with people, and thus girls, better while making you a genuinely interesting, useful human being.", "You're doing great OP, continue.\nAlso, have you thought about making a single PDF of these ?\nThere should be a freaking wiki like this.", ">>17668655\nOP here. Agreed 100% Learning to quantify price was a biggie for me:\n\n>This bed is \u00a31500? Expensive.\n>This bed lasts 30 years so costs \u00a350/year or \u00a30.13/use and provides better sleep and features than the others? Bargain.\n\nAlso learning to focus/work on a goal for a time period rather than an outcome was a biggie:\n\nInstead of trying to get that article written by the end of the day, I'll try to write that article for 1 hour today. That way if it takes less than an hour to write, I'm working towards a goal I will accomplish regardless. No self-imposed pressure.\n\nThe issue is that slow, steady and cliche solutions don't sound good on a blog post or 4chan thread, so people look for magic pills and radical change/solution. At the end of the day most things are a product of how much time and energy you put into them, simple as.", ">>17668446\n>ATTENTION: OP IS A RETARD AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HEALTH.\n\n>THE TRUE BLUEPRINT FOR LOSING WEIGHT IS: NO SUGAR, NO CARBS, HIGH FAT MEAT, AND EXERCISE. \n\n>CUTTING CALORIES \"WORKS\" BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU LONG-TERM HEALTH AND FITNESS.\n\n>NO SUGAR. NO PROCESSED FOODS. NO CARBOHYDRATES. MEAT, VEGETABLES, AN OCCASSIONAL FRUIT.", ".", ">>17668664\nAppreciate the thumbs up. I'm just writing on the fly things that I've done and changed successfully in my life, good to know it's mostly non-bullshit. Negative on the PDF.", "Not really a blueprint but this is another one I see a lot\n>I'm not motivated\nMotivation is a legal term which was hi-jacked by the self help book industry to sell a concept: That you need X to accomplish your goals/targets. You don't. You don't need motivation to work. Motivation never stopped anyone from getting their day to day shit done. Self-help is sold on the idea of creating a barrier to entry when one typically doesn't exist.\n\nThere's also a big overlap with depression here, as many people feel mentally or physically lethargic as a result of shitty hormones, shitty lifestyle or a combination thereof. See the depression blueprint for fixing yourself first.\n\nSo the better question is\n>How do I accomplish X?\nThe answer is to set a SMART goal and then work towards it. SMART is a list of criteria that comes from corporate management, but is still great shit. It typically stands for Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon (not really relevant unless you're working as a group/team), Realistic and Time-Bound.\n\nIt's possible to go autistic and over analyse your problem and over complicate a plan (which, by the way, is a form of procrastination in itself) so generally you want one line for what you want to accomplish. Let's take\n\n>Being fit\nThis isn't SMART, so Specifically, what do we mean? Work out what you actually want, being able to squat 100kg, deadlift 120kg and benchpress 80kg will give us all-round strength, and running for 3 miles in 30 minutes means we have a fit/good cardio system.\nInstead of being fit we now have\n>Deadlift 120kg, Squat 100kg, Bench 80kg, Run 3 miles in 30 min\nWe measure how long it'll take us to reach that assuming average results and where we are and ensure it's actually achievable. So with that info we now have\n>Deadlift 120kg, Squat 100kg, Bench 80kg, Run 3 miles in 30min within 6 months (by July 2017)\n\nWe now have >Specific >Measurable >Realistic & >Time-Bound and can break it down into daily or weekly or whatever we want & get started.", "Also to add to the last point, you're typically giving up because of procrastination (which I've learned a lot about from a website I'll dig up after this post) and pressure/emotional distress.\n\nThat is, you logically conclude that working toward your task will feel like shit and that you'd rather not do it, but you feel guilty so you create another small simple task for yourself instead or distract yourself to forget about it and move on.\n\nLearning to separate how you feel from what you do is subtle but ultra important. Learning that you can suffer and be unhappy and not enjoy doing something, but STILL get it done is imperative. Also as we know, a task is almost always hardest and has the most resistance before we actually start it, and that getting to the gym (for example) feels like an arduous task, but once we're there we're instantly relieved and happy doing the work and putting in the effort.\n\ntl;dr Feeling pressure/intense effort to do a thing is normal and mostly goes away after you start.\n\nHere's that procrastination site I was talking about, this guy has a ton of great science backed info on why we procrastinate and how not to.\n\nMeditation is again, a really simple part of the solution.\n\nhttp://iprocrastinate.libsyn.com/", ">>17668659\n>you're uninteresting or not valuable\n>girls get pursued a lot and can be selective\n\nOk, that might apply if she works a great job, has a huge social life and does a variety of fun and interesting things. But the women working at the local supermarket, living with parents and not going to school who are kinda \"average\" looking sometimes think they're hot shit.

What is their objective?\n\nThe same reason guys posts pictures of themselves holding guns or posing in gym mirrors or kneeling next to a giant deer.\n\nSociety values women's bodies so by getting other people to praise them they not only feel validated by you but as society as a whole. In the eyes of society, if a woman is not physically attracted and wanted by a lot of people then she's kind of less of a woman. Every day you see commercials, TV shows, movies and music videos featuring drop dead gorgeous 10's with a flat tummy and perfect bone structure and everyone praises them. Why wouldn't you think that a girl, especially a young impressionable one, wouldn't do everything she could to obtain just a tiny bit of the praise and admiration that she sees all these celebrities getting?\n\nAt the same time, a woman who doesn't put a great emphasis on looks or who leaves the house without makeup or maybe doesn't dress very sharply or wears baggy clothes is looked at strangely in public. Subconsciously we all sort of expect women to exude a certain amount of allure and sexuality and believe it or not a majority of young women internalize this into their everyday behavior.\n\nOn the other hand society values men's virility, power and leadership. A man with big muscles, a man with a fast car, a man holding a big gun, a man leading a football team or standing around a beach with no shirt on and 6 girls on his arm.\n\nLook up Dan Bilzerian on instagram and you'll see a perfect representation of the \"male nude\".

And finally what auto insurance company do you recommend?"}, "replies": ["Geico is a p good insurance company.

I need help with an internal conflict that I just can't handle on my own.\n\nAbout a month ago I got drunk for the first time. I was at a camp out where a few of us high school seniors spent our last moments together before going off to college. Well a few hours into it, one of the girls brought a bottle of Smirnoff. I hadn't planned on drinking, but we had made a pledge to do whatever we were told to by the others. The girl who brought the vodka was an old friend I met in 6th grade when I moved across the country to where I live now. I'd rate her at an 8.5/10. The two of us were very very close at one point, and I had a massive crush on her around that time. We eventually drifted away as friends. Anyway, when she showed up with the drink she said that she wanted me to get drunk, and that she wanted to get drunk with me. And I did just that. I took drink after drink until I had drank half the bottle (vodka girl had a quarter of the bottle and the rest was distributed to the other people). It was an otherworldly experience. I felt as if I had no control over my actions. And...well, I didnt. My memory of that night is splotchy, but I remember constantly laughing at nothing, and being concerned about where vodka girl and this other 9/10 girl is. Another thing I remember is lots and lots of kissing vodka girl, and proclaiming my love to her. The problem is that I have a girlfriend. 8/10 appearance, 9/10 personality. We have a lot of history together as best friends, and she means everything to me. But she's very sensitive due to constant abuse from past partners, and I'm afraid that if I tell her then she'll either take it personally and hate herself, or she'll leave me. But I feel like a scumbag for hiding this, and it's eating me up on the inside. And the \"I was drunk\" excuse won't work for shit on her.

My parents divorced at age 11 but I would cry myself to sleep as early as age 7 over the arguing and physical abuse I could hear my father inflicting on my mother in their bedroom. Obviously, my mother had custody of me and she raised a sensitive, pathetic young male. I was rejected throughout school, my birthdays were nothing but an 'expensive gift' in lieu of a birthday party because I had no friends. I also grew up poor as shit, we got donated gifts for christmas and I ate hotdogs and bread throughout my adolescence. I was also partially deaf and I was taught some sign language because the doctors thought I was going to be fully deaf by adulthood. Aside from that, my childhood was a blur.\nI had a case of 'Senioritis' in highschool but it was merely a lack of desire to exist and I barely scraped by with my HS diploma. I went to a community college but failed at everything except indoor archery because I showed up. I joined the military because I had nothing else going for me. I pulled some mental gymnastics and managed to hide my social ineptness and sadness behind military bearing. I left after 6 years of being hazed and being borderline suicidal (honorable discharge, I stuck it out until my time was up). My last year in the military, I had an affair with a girl I worked and fell in love with. She saw the empty husk of a human being I was behind my defenses and left me for her 'former boyfriend'. She took my heart along with her.\nI had developed savant like skills in electronics repair and I thought I had a shot at engineering.

Depending on their diagnosis, they can give you mediaction to relieve your mental stress and you can start focusing on your shit again.\n\nThen, it's time to tackle your issues: You have to out there and find people who appreciate you. And believe me, they are out there. Hobbies, sports, political gatherins, whatever. Just go out and talk with other people. \n\nMost importantly, learn from the negative experiences with other people, take your lessons from the relationsships that failed (especially if you might have done stupid things) and work on yourself, strive to be a better person. Meet new people with whom you can apply the lessons you've learnt.\n\nAll the past mistakes are only mistakes if you've not learnt anything from them.

They will help you with stopping the downward spiral, even if it will take some time. \n\nI was in a similar situation a bit more than a year ago. It takes time and effort do the therapy with a psychologist, but it's well worth it. \n\nIt took me months to open up to talk about a childhood trauma that I had never talked about before. When I left after that session, I felt so fucking relieved. It was a good feeling when everythign else just sucked. \n\nAlso, in case you have a mental condition, it may take some time to get to the right diagnosis. I started going to the psychiatrist in early 2015, I believe, but it was only two weeks ago that I had the correct diagnosis that I have a slight form of aspergers that's been impairing my life and my relationsships for as far as I can remember. Now I have some mediacation that help significantly, I keep going to the doctor as find out what I need to do in my daily life to improve myself and my condition, I will meet with people who suffer from the same condition, and so on, and so on. \n\nJust, please, please, please, please, don't give up, especially in the darkest moments when you think you are completly lost and nothing will ever change for the better.\n\nThe world needs you.

The psychiatrist made a guess that I might be living with a mild form of Autism. If you've gone through something similar and medication and therapy worked, that's really uplifting news. There's few people I can connect with, it's always seemed like I was missing something to properly function. It's just hard to accept that I can't live a normal life with the circumstances I've been given.", ">>17146219\n\nThe only thing I can tell you is to go out and have many experiences as possible with people.\n\nMy problem (and maybe yours) is that I don't \"understand\" human interaction to some degree. I have a hard time understanding how to behave, what to say, understanding what the other is feeling, what my words might have an effect on the other person. \n\nSo, for years I've been alienating people around me without understanding what was wrong.\n\nThe good thing is that you can improve. The bad thing is that I only \"get\" what I'm doing wrong when it hurts me. When I fuck up horribly. So, it's a difficult process, but you can improve not only your behaviour, but also your self-esteem. BECAUSE I got out of that hole, I now have confidence in myself. Doesn't mean that everything I do is fine, far from it. I still fuck up a lot. But I know that with every mistake I make, I'll become a better human. I know that I have the ability to improve.\n\nMy other problem was that I had concentration problems for years. First year at uni, I had to drop out because I couldn't study. It was the same before, but I managed in HS. But at the Uni it just was too much. Turned out that the concentration disorder was a side effect of the asperger. A fucking miracle that I made it even this far with my impairment. Thanks to the medication I have now, it's a lot better, even if it's still not perfect.\n\nAnd maybe that's a thing for you to remember: If you've had so much shit thrown at you and still came this far, that's because you are a capable, intelligent and skilled person. My psychiatrist told me that if I weren't as intelligent as I am, I would have never made it this far with my problems. I was a fucking officer in the army, for god's sake. Who had to lead 45 men. And I have fucking aspergers and don't know how to deal with people. I somhow survived, even if I got my ass kicked horribly. But I learnt things about human interaction that I otherwise would have never known or learnt.", ">>17146219\n\n>It's just hard to accept that I can't live a normal life with the circumstances I've been given.\n\nI know what you mean too well. But even with that realization, I've always been hesitent to get angry because of this fact.\n\nHere are a couple of things that I'll always remind me off.\n\n-You'll understand the value of the good things in life because you'll know that you yourself got there. Life wasn't easy, but you made it better YOURSELF. YOU have the power to make your life better and worth living. YOU are in control of your own destiny. \n\n-You'll learn to deal with shit. Everybody gets thrown into a ditch by life at some point. If you learn it now, and start appreciating everything that's good about it. You'll not only make more of it because you undestand its value while it lasts but you'll be prepared for the serious shit that's bound to happane later in life (ilnesses, death, etc.).\nI try to take care much more of myself in the last time.Eat well and do sports. It's hard with the uni schedule we have, but I'll try to improve my behaviour next year. \n\n-You'll stop being less of an arrogant asshole and be more empethy towards others. But being able to help them is complete other story as I had to find out the hard way. Just because you start understanding and try to help with the plight of others, doesn't mean that you have a right to do so or that you have any idea what you are doing. Chances are you'll make it worse if you're like me :)\n\n-And fuck life being easy, man. Like, when you are on your deathbed do you want to look back having a life without hardships? In movies and books, we expect the MC to have difficulties and problems that he's supposed to overcome, so it is fucking interesting. But in our real lives we expect everything to go perfect. I fucking prefer to suffer and learn and to become a better human and have earned my good and interesting life instead of having it easy."]}, "17142351": {"op": {"timestamp": 1463215677, "title": "Scar on face", "comment": "Serious question, scarred faces intrigue me and I want one but how do I go about it?

After that trip I could not smoke weed without getting horribly anxious and paranoid, which had never happened to me before. This was about a year ago and what ended up helping me was two things, one of which I for sure recommend and one which I can't in good conscience. The first thing is that I just stopped smoking with other people for a while, and I stopped smoking to get high. I would get \"buzzed\" and then quit there, and while there was slight paranoia and anxiety I learned how to deal with it. The second thing was to get insanely high by myself and get into that head space again, sort of force myself to relive the feelings I got from that original trip. I kept the voice recorder on my phone on and a pen and paper next to me and started talking and writing and drawing whatever came to my mind, and that actually ended up helping me make the connections I needed to make to understand what made me have that awful trip in the first place.

I'd get horrible flashbacks and enter the same headspace every time I smoked. In a weird way it's comforting that you've also experienced something similar because I thought I was all alone because no one could relate. I got a lot of shitty advice that kind of cut deep. \n\nWhat I did was stop smoking. Completely. I did it about 3 times in the span of 4 years. A lot of those feelings and thoughts naturally went away as time passed and I forgot about the trauma. About 2 months ago I smoked again for the first time. I kind of did something similar to what >>17113843 suggested, in that at the start I took a hit and was pleasantly buzzed. It kind of eased me back into the headspace. I did that for a few days. Afterwards, when I was in a really safe environment with my brother (who is really kind, accepting and more experienced with this stuff than I), I went hard. I kind of forced myself to deal with it and I came to many conclusions and resolutions that really eased my mind. A lot of that insight came because I'm older now (25) and have more wisdom, maturity, self-awareness, etc etc. \n\nDid I completely get over everything? I don't know. I think so. After that I smoked a lot in many different environments and with different people and I felt fine.

Surely taking a good chunk of the time you waste on it and using it in more productive things would be best, but quit thinking you should quit League, or any game, or 4chan, entirely. Just do a lot of other things, too. Hobbies, work, any other activity can help compose your routine. You don't need to quit games. If you eliminate just this one addiction suddenly, you'll just find something else to be addicted to. You need to work on all the other bigger problems that are in front of you that you think that are a reflection of LoL, but they aren't. They are parallel problems. League isn't like a Alcohol or Drugs that can kill you and make you waste as much money on it as they can(even if you can spend up to hundreds on the game). It doesn't need to be an addiction. Just turn it into a hobby rather than a full-time activity.\n\n As for the rest of your problems, there is a simple but hard solution; start by doing one thing you dislike but find necessery to do at a time. Force yourself out of your room, go on a trip to a small, cheap town close to yours just you alone. See that there is a world beyond your room, house and city. Learn and notice the great things you can do to yourself, body and mind, to other people and things. To resume: Start doing something. You already know this. Go learn a new language, pick a part time job, start lifting, or something similar. Just do something out of the ordinary and stick to it.\n\n Games or 4chan aren't your problem, your mentality is."]}, "17031244": {"op": {"timestamp": 1460567120, "title": null, "comment": "I don't click with my boyfriends friends/family .. should we break. up?? \n\nI am kinda socially awkward anyway so it is harder for me to \"click\" with people, but I really don't fit in with his friends or family.

If you're already late twenties or something, consider that you should just look for a partner who is okay with having an open relationship. \n\nIt is normal to be in a monogamous relationship and occasionally have to ignore a crush or a flare of lust.

You are not a good partner to her, you are simply managing to not drop the mask so far. Let's be real, if she were to look into your head and realize the thoughts and desires you have and have had, there's a good chance she would already deem your future dead while you are still clinging to the pride that at least you have not acted on these desires yet.\n\nAnd with that I don't mean to say it doesn't mean anything that you haven't, just that you are working with a different frame of reference.

At most you'll be able to live this double life where you can convince her at surface level that all is well. This inclination is part of you, not some external threat to your relationship.

She'll tell you how special and amazing you are and you'll know in your heart she doesn't know wtf she's saying and that you're not. Etc. etc. It will eat at you in small ways and poison you in the long-term. In the short term you'll probably get addicted to the thrill and keep cheating on her.

When a civilization is able to flourish without the majority of the population doing physical labor, we start to select for other qualities, notably the ones that are made popular in our society by media. The current trend is gym bods and symmetrical faces. 60 years ago it was having a trim/thin body and symmetrical face.\n\nWhite people have made some up and down progress in attaining a comfortable, non-physical lifestyle. In the absence of a need for strength, we've been selecting for beauty on and off for several thousand years. \n\nBlack people and South Americans only recently 'came online' economically. They were working in small villages and tribes, roughing it, for much longer than the people in Europe. They've been selecting for strength for longer. Black people have a longer, more supple Achilles tendon. They're able to jump higher and run faster. They were selectively bred for strength by slave owners for a long time. \n\nWhite people are perceived as more beautiful than other races (in general, not saying everyone feels this way). This is in part because they are physically more symmetrical in the face, and partly because the media continues to propagate the idea, in effect brainwashing the general population. \n\nIt's not racist to say these things- they're based on fact.

And i have had my fair share of tme to think about why i act the way i do and how i ended up being a slutty girl instead of a \"normal\" girl. \nBasicall it went like that: i always seemed to have a good hand with guys. From kindergarden on i always had a \"bf\". I was a really cute girl. Blue eyes, long blond hair, tiny, big lips, and so on. Otherwise i was a bit tomboyish. My dad often did \"boy-stuff\" with us so that was what i liked to do. I guess that combination of cute and daring was what made boys fall for me all the time. I didn't give it much thought. If somebody asked me to be his gf i said yes. It didn't mean more to me than being friends. Then i hit puberty. Pretty soon. I was 11 when my boobs started to grow. I was the first girl in my class to get boobs, menses and pubes. All the other girl where jealousr and that made the difference. Otherwise i might have felt weird or ashamed about the changes my body went trough. But the fact that it was somebody others envied me for made my new found fmeininity something i was feeling good about. This was when i started to notice that guys have found a new interest in me. They would go out of their way to make me enjoy their company. I just went with it cause why should i be suspicious about something so pleasant? My parents went trough a really rough patch exactly at that time and NO BODY even noticed that i had hit puberty. Nobody ever talked to me about guys, sex, relstionships, intimacy,love. So my sexualitu developed wild and uncontrolled. There was the first kiss. It was with a guy that was my \"bf\". We where chilling in his backjard, bantering and playfighting. At some point he just kissed me. It felt awesome so i went with it. It didn't cross my mind that it mifght be \"too soon\" or \"inappropriate\" or whatever. I just felt nice so it must be good, right? This continued untill i eventually lost my virginity. Absolutely unaware of any \nCont.", ">>16933581\nCont.\n\nsocial or moraly unnacceptable behaviour from my side. I mean, cuddling and kissing felt good. Petting made me tingly and then guys had a dick! How excitingt! And it gets hard when you play with it. I was in awe. This continued. It only ever hit me that i am now a slut after i left my first serious long time bf at the age of 20. And then it already was too late. It doesn't change a thing about me. It's just that having sex and enjoying intimacy was so natural and innocent to me that i never thought it is a problem to do whatever i feel like as long as i'm not hurting anybodies feelings. But boy was i wrong...\n\nOn one side i am happy that i was able to develope my sexuality so uninterupted by social norms. But on the other side i am now a \"slut\", which limits the amount of good guys that would consider forming a serious relationship with me big time. And that makes me really sad sometimes but there's not much i can do to change that. In fact the only thing i could do is lie or not act the way i would naturally.

Many courts will accept a woman's lack of sex as grounds for divorce -- so even the legal system agrees it's expected. \n\nNow if you kids are just 17 to 20ish, and haven't even been together a few months, yeah, wait, but I can tell you as a 28 year old that hasn't been single for longer than 3 months since I was 17, if we aint fucking after the first month then your ass is getting dropped. Sex is a critical part of a relationship - anyone who says otherwise is a kid or inexperienced and hasn't held myltiple relationships that lasted multiple years. Sexual compatibility is a requirement, and no way am I getting too invested in someone before I know we are sexually compatable.\n\nIf she wants to wait, that's fine, but it takes two to tango, so if respect is equal in the relationship then you both have an equal say in realistically having some kind of 'point' where it should be okay. If she never wants to have sex with you, that is perfecrly fine. It's her body.

All these other online dating venues? Nothing but crazies. I've had relationships and flings with over a dozen girls off websites. I'm generalizing from my own anecdotal evidence but after being with over a dozen, it really seems to attract mentally unstable people who aren't ready/not willing to learn how to have a relationship. \n\n2) I'm also in the military, so I have experience with long distance relationships as well. These only ever work if you knew the person before you left, and even then, not often. This isn't just my experience - anyone in the military can tell you the same. This is just part and parcel of being in the service.\n\nA long distance relationship with someone you met online?

Virgins are the worst sex you will have. I promise.

I knew of this premise before it got serious between us and it was def what made me stay, I wouldn't have gone for any other kind of long distance thing however strongly I felt.\n\nWere any of your ldrs like this at all?

I've been bullied, and I fucking hate bullies. I was a bouncer when I was in my early 20's, and hated fighting, but that doesn't stop you when it's time- it just helps you seek out alternatives first.

My own experience is that lots of people DO NOT know how to \"mitigate the impact,\" or plan on whether or not they'll hit their heads on the way down. And so one simple little punch in the face just like you see in the movies can cause so much more damage than you could've imagined, to the poor guy you hit in the face, and your own life as well.\n\nEspecially since OP is a big guy and probably stronger than he thinks, he SHOULD be afraid to \"dole it out.\" My attitude today is that you shouldn't even throw a punch unless you're truly prepared, and feel it's necessary, for this to be a life-or-death conflict. Because it very well could be, even if you don't mean it. I think it's good to have an aversion to hitting people, especially since he clearly isn't a pussy who will just avoid confrontation entirely. It's good to resolve things non-violently, and I don't think it really matters whether or not it's motivated by fear.", ">>16772707\n>when things got heated I just felt weak in my arms, even though I know I can throw a punch\nThe main thing there is being able to transition very quickly in to the right mindset. Getting physical with someone is a piece of cake - just so long as you're expecting it. It's when you're sat drinking your beer/waiting for the bus/generally minding your own business and find yourself squaring off with someone a split second later that it gets difficult, because your brain is too busy trying to work out what the hell is going on to do anything useful. It's like the difference between giving a presentation at work and being expected to give an impropmtu speech in front of a crowd with no notice. Like anything else you get used to it the more often you do it, allthough if you're getting in random confrontations often enough to become profficient at it you probably need to re-think your behaviour.\n\n\n>I told the old man \"no that's not going to happen. We are not gonna fight. You are just going to keep on jogging \"...\nYou handled that really well to be fair. Hitting people isn't like in the movies - they don't fall down and say \"ok you win\" then everyone cheers. Bear in mind that most people won't pick a fight with someone if they don't think they'll win, and you don't know if they've got a knife, a gun, six of their mates waiting round the corner or if he's just going to follow you home and set your house on fire when your kids are asleep upstairs.\n\nAlso, particularly for those of us who are on the larger side, there's a very real risk of it going too far the other way. I'm the same height as you and about 270lbs, and the last time I hit someone (which was a very long time ago, far to old for that kind of thing now) I honest to god thought I'd killed him.

It's called the \"A.R.E.\" method.\n>A: Anchor\nThe Anchor is a shared experience between both you and your target. A hard test that you just took, the rain that you just stepped out of, the traffic you both got caught in on the way to work, the weird smell in the bookstore you're both in. Anything that links the two of you together.\nExample: \"Dr. Landis is hilarious!\"\n>R: Reveal\nThe Reveal is something you share about yourself which is related to the Anchor that you started off with..\nExample: I\u2019ve tried to get into Dr. Landis\u2019 class for three semesters, and this is the first time I was able to land a spot.\n>E: Encourage\nThe Encourage is when you move the subject of the conversation from you to your target. This is when you get to ask them how they feel about the Anchor, in a way that logically flows from the Reveal.\nExample: Did you have a hard time getting into the class?\n\nEmploying the ARE method makes conversation starters a breeze, and you can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions and commenting on their responses. People love to talk about themselves, so keeping things focused on them is smart, but keep them feeling at ease by remembering to Reveal more about yourself as follow-ups to their answers.\n\nIt sounds cheesy but it helped me get my social life back after being a cocoon mode NEET for a few years and losing all my social skills.

The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961.\n\nThe Electoral College, established in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, is the institution that elects the President and Vice President of the United States every four years. The President and Vice President are not elected directly by the voters. Instead, they are elected by \"electors\" who are chosen by popular vote on a state-by-state basis. As the District of Columbia is not a state, it was not entitled to any electors prior to the adoption of the Twenty-third Amendment. Citizens living in the district were therefore shut out from the presidential\u2013vice presidential election process. The first presidential election in which the District of Columbia participated was the election of 1964. This amendment mentions the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it mentions how the district's electors should perform duties provided by said amendment.\n\nAccording to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors.[1] Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election.", ">>16649744\nMentor (MEN-(t)\u0259r) is a city in Lake County, Ohio, United States. Mentor was first settled in 1797. The population was 47,159 at the 2010 census. In July 2006, CNNMoney.com ranked Mentor 68th in a list of the Top 100 Best Places to Live in America. Just four years later in July 2010, CNNMoney.com ranked Mentor 37th on the same list.\n\nIn 1876 James A. Garfield purchased a home in Mentor, from which he conducted the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Garfield coined the term \"Mentorite\" when referring to a native of Mentor.[citation needed] That home is now maintained as the James A. Garfield National Historic Site. The city is home to Headlands Beach State Park, the longest public swimming beach in Ohio. The city is a major center of retail stores, ranking sixth-largest in Ohio as of 2012,[6] and restaurants, ranking seventh-largest in the state as of 2012.[7] US 20 (Mentor Avenue) is the major retail center, which includes the Great Lakes Mall, with additional shopping and strip malls found along most major roads. Convenient Food Mart is based in Mentor. Major products include medical related, polymers, plastics, electric boards and other peripherals that generally serve the computer and automation industries. Two major railroads pass through the city, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern.\n\nMentor's school system consists of 9 elementary schools, three middle schools, and Mentor High School. Like many school systems in Ohio, Mentor Schools suffered a financial crisis in the early 2000s, but passed a large levy and is now largely on solid footing[8] - one of the fastest Ohio school systems ever to emerge from fiscal emergency.[citation needed] The financial difficulties were due in part to years of accounting fraud.\n\nCity government is based on a city manager executive appointed by city council. The city encourages development of light industry, which is reflected in its diverse economy and very low property taxes."]}, "16645232": {"op": {"timestamp": 1451975738, "title": null, "comment": "Hey, /adv/.

But you'll most likely just spit on it anyway. \n\nOn the other hand most females are more than eager to give evolutionary reasons why they prefer tall men over short men.

The problem lies in the opposition always jumping to insecurity or misogyny. That's why I just say \"because it is\".\n\n>isn't judging a whole person simply on your expectation how he/she is supposed to be ... extreme, to say the least?\nJudging a person because of an action? Not at all. Treating them like subhumans? In this case, absolutely.

Maybe people into red are more aggressive\nIf someone scientifically finds out that people who like red are likely to cave my skull in, then I'd stay the fuck away from people who like red.\n\nAs for a purely social stigma associated with red? If that was the case I'd probably dislike people who like red too (simply because of upbringing), but a single thought can convince me that people can't control their preference. I was raised by Muslim parents and they disliked both homosexuality and promiscuity. Thinking about both has left me with a distaste for promiscuity (actions), but I could never find a reason to hate homosexuality (preference).\n\nAs I see it, color preference is just that: a preference.

There goes a bunch of wasted time.\n\n>Our actions are the result of our preferences though.\nThey are still choices you make. I'm sure there are gay Christians who refuse to have gay sex because it's against their religion. On the other hand, promiscuous women often affect other women to become promiscuous, even if they never intended to be. In fact, there are articles strewn around the internet telling non-promiscuous women it's totally fine and normal to be promiscuous, and that there are absolutely no consequences.

I eat peanut butter daily while he almost pukes at even the smell of it. Just to give one example. What I can see here, and what is a red line through all of your argumentation that you give an extremely large role to nurture and almost completely dismiss nature. Which is baseless ofcourse, the truth is that while nurture can have a big influence in many areas, in many other areas things are determined genetically and this also includes a wide range of behaviours/preferences etc.\n\n>Even though polygamy was common through our entire history and never was a big talking point before sand people religion took over.\n\nYour argument again stems from nurture (a preference for polygamy/monogamy is culturally based. Although I would agree it is to a certain extent, it also has its base in evolution.\n\n>They would be only partially right, since the protector function is obviously gone these days. Monogamy never had one beyond extra protection for the kids\n\nThis posts shows your clear lack of understanding of the concept of evolution.\nEvolutionary traits and preferences developed over hundres of thousands of years. The protector function having a smaller role in todays society is something of the last few centuries, such a short time span has no effect whatsoever on evolutionary preferences. So the fact that there is no clear cut evolutionary advantage for men to be tall anymore in terms of being a better protector does not mean that the preference for taller men for being a better protector isn't still present today.", "itt people who arent getting laid are being jelly of people who do on a saturday night", ">>16637987\n>It's fine and good but human societies advanced way faster than human bodies, it seems only given to use our intelligence to adjust to the change.

The evolutionary process has nothing to do with what is moraly just or what is fair.
