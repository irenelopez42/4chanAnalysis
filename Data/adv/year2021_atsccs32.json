Please do it as soon as possible.\n>Wear diapers at night to protect your bed\nNothing wrong with doing this. It's just a medical/hygiene item like q-tips or toothbrushes.\n>Do not try to reduce your water intake\nStaying hydrated is much more important than trying to stop the wetting that way. You're risking damage to your kidneys and your whole body suffers when dehydrated.\n>Use special hygiene products to protect your crotch area\nHaving to use diapers long term stresses your skin. (Not staying hydrated makes this even worse!) You should probably be using some barrier creams or something to protect your skin from irritation and chafing. I'm unfortunately not 100% sure which specific products are best but just give it a google, you'll find something.\n>Don't be harsh on yourself about it\nI understand you must feel humiliated and in pain, but you aren't alone with this issue. Thousands of people live perfectly normal lives with this condition. If your parents are shaming you about it or have been in the past, that's extremely shitty parenting.\nThere are plenty of resources online if you have concerns about how to live with this. What's most important is what your doctor tells you. Depending on where you live you might be eligible for some benefits to help you offset the costs of treatment or medical items.\n\nBelieve me, you can have a gf, you can have roommates.

(See the excellent article I\u2019ve cited below.)\n\nEven if there are 20,000 nerve endings, so what? There are seven kinds of nerve endings, so which kind is where is important. My fingers have a lot of nerve endings, but I could suck one all day and never have an orgasm!\n\nAll of that aside, I think the foreskin does play a role in sexual pleasure. As a man who has one, I think I can better guess what it would be like to have sex without than those without can guess what it would be like to have sex with a foreskin.\n\nYes, the foreskin gives sexual pleasure, but it\u2019s complex. Retracting the foreskin feels very good. This is a mix of the nerves in the foreskin and the glans. Many uncircumcised men masturbate by moving the foreskin up and down over the glans, and they do so in a way that provides the glans with a level of stimulation that would not bring a circumcised man to climax. I don\u2019t know if the difference is due to the glans being more sensitive, or the added stimulation from the foreskin, or a combination of both. I suspect it\u2019s a combination.\n\nThen there is sex. During intercouse, I can thrust in ways that change how the foreskin moves and how much the glans is exposed. This allows control of the amount of stimulation and helps with controlling when I climax. And of course, it\u2019s been shown the so-called gliding action of the foreskin is more comfortable for women.\n\nTL;DR The number is bogus, but the value of the foreskin is real.", ">>25116791\n>woman swearing lewd clothes to church I\u2019m def throwing her out\nftfy", ">>25116867\nWould you want to dominate another woman with your husband?", ">>25116884\nnta, but there\u2019s an appeal on seeing what he likes doing to me from an outside view", "Women here, what is your opinion about tattoos?

The setting itself is this: there is a \"counter earth\" or planet in Earth's opposite alignment with the sun, called Gor. Humans have been transported there over the centuries by insectoid aliens called the Priest Kings, who enforce strict rules about the use of certain technologies and keep the humans at the level of feuding city-states.\nGender essentialism, and particularly feminine slavery, is a big theme in the Gor books. A running idea is that Gor is a more 'natural' world than Earth: men are naturally sexually dominant and also are permitted to indulge in their feelings and speak openly more often than on earth. Gorean men being able to weep openly is repeatedly referenced as one of the merits of Gorean society, as is the (explicitly sexual) enslavement of women. Women in Gor often find that being enslaved to a powerful and loving man is a net positive. Conversely, male enslavement is always unnatural and to be resisted, though villainess tyrants do exist.\nIt's no secret that these are kink-fantasy books. The author even wrote an entire non-fiction book called \"Imaginative Sex\" that was basically about coming up with elaborate worlds and scenarios for sexual roleplaying. The prose is very dry, and the setting itself is more-or-less Jon Carter of Mars with a few added bits and more explicit sex.

And this idolisation of a perfect relationship blinds you from seeing what will be my second point.\n\n>I can tell it bothers her, she cried in front of me once\nSo she still cares about you? Otherwise, she wouldn't have cried, right? \nThe problems can be found in the fact that there may be some love but you struggle because she wasn't able to meet some requirements that you expect from a mother.\n\nNow, and these are my two cents anon, you can take it or leave it, it is up to you. Each relationship with a parent is very particular and it is not something that you can let be judged by some anons on this board. You whole relationship, all its memories and how it affected you cannot be summarized in a few link. \n\nWith that being said, I would advise you to start seeing your mother as a human being, a woman first, and then as a mother.

Instead, he provides what you need so that you can help yourself. For example, if I'm feeling lonely and pray to him, my loneliness might not go away immediately. Instead, with a bit of patience, he might place someone in my life that makes me feel like I'm not alone. Additinally, when you dedicate your life to serving him, actual miracles happen.

All you gotta do is trust him and seek him.", ">>24712483\n>>24712780\nBut inherent in this type of thinking is you have zero understanding of what depression is. Why do you think it is incurable? Is it because you think it takes effort to escape it? It doesn\u2019t take any effort. \n\nThe problem is very simple. Everything you have ever tried to do, struggled to motivate yourself to do, and simply dropped away from was the wrong thing. Everything society tells you a human should do is wrong. Society tells you how a coward lives. And then it proceeds to bomb you with demoralizing news, and you keep imbibing with no thought to how it affects you.\n\nWhen you think \u201cnothing matters\u201d, you are looking for things to matter in an impossible way. No, you will never mean anything on the scale of 1000+ years, but do you really think this is what you need?\n\nThe only thing you need is to live as a human is really supposed to live. It will speak to your soul and make you come alive to an extent you don\u2019t even understand. \n\nIt is not a game of effort. It is just a game of willingness and of examination and non-judgement and of opening all the doors you have shut again. You have to be willing to go mentally where things have a chance to excite you. It will take a long time to find it, but if you are honest, you know where to look. It is light. It\u2019s not pushy, it is not about willpower or \u201cgetting yourself to do\u201d... Until you whole heartedly want, despite the fear which will definitely also be there, you shouldn\u2019t try. The problem is you have closed yourself off to most of life and are getting mentally ill trying to find something that will move you within the small confines you have created. And there is nothing in there, you are completely right about that. You have to stop feeling that heavy, depressing judgement every time you imagine anything, because you are already thinking about making yourself do it. You never \u201cmake yourself\u201d. You only examine the truth, and it must be free of emotional momentum", ">>24712786\nInteresting, so his role in your life is as sort of a companion that completes you despite your external circumstances?", ">>24709117\nYes.

Crypto is the bastion of freedom and decentralization in a seemingly dystopian, totalitarian digital age so I want to do my part and help it succeed in it's vision. At the same time, I want to look how freedom of the mind to me to the mental low I felt a few years ago and would now want to help myself and others get a grip on our lives.

The people who spend the most time on the internet is the mentally ill, and it is infectious to be around. There is a reason we have historically kept them at arms length. Most people are not strong enough to be around it without being corrupted. \n\nAlso for anyone that is a man, read the book king, warrior, magician, lover - the archetypes of the mature masculine. It really is a great book. The way to understand these archetypes is they are energies / sources of motivation supplied by your nature. If they do not find their expression in your psyche, you will be depressed. It is extremely important for a man to continually foster a multifacetted and divine image of the masculine. Most people only think of the warrior when they picture the masculine - and a poorly integrated one at that. Harsh, cold, unempathetic, emotionless. The truth is masculinity is warm, loving and benevolent. It is God. When feminism criticizes masculinity, it has always been all the places where the individual fell short. The true, perfect, divine masculinity is in reality the only thing that can save them from their mental hell.\n\nSimilarly, there is a divine, perfect feminine. Porn (in part) has ruined that, so now women don\u2019t get to experience themselves as that, because it is the man\u2019s job to show it to her, because women are quite reflective. Instead they show her she is a flesh light - and thus a flesh light she will believe herself to be.

It was an expensive habit for her to have and once we stopped meeting together she latched on to guys that would support her drinking habit be it friends, dates and bfs. If she couldnt latch on to a guy that would buy her drinks she would sink her wages into the nightlife. Nightlife also risked drug use and a FB status indicated that she was on drugs. Eventually the drinking problem consumed her sweetness, cuteness and gorgeous self and she became a goblin. That is to say a vaguely human face. She has a kid now, maybe a single mum as I didnt see her with her husband or bf on a Sunday. \n\nEventually she your girl might just seek someone to support her drinking habit and that could be her drinking buddy too.

Her dad just passed away last month from, you guessed it, a slow and miserable death due to alcohol addiction. So, it's genetic I feel. And obviously all the trauma she's endured.

If you wash her before she goes to sleep, that means she wakes up clean; without you, she might wake up smelling of urine and vomit, and have to pick the leaves out of her own pussy. Probably that wouldn't be enough to make a difference... but if it keeps happening, eventually it may add up and she'll reach the point where she truly appreciates that she has a problem. \n\nKnowing that her drinking caused her to lose you might be another important step in that process.\n\nNow, the sad truth is that if you leave her, she will probably die - choke on her own vomit one night. But the even sadder truth is that, even if you continue to protect her, she will eventually die anyway; and at least this way there's a chance she might pull it together.\n\nSo, give her an ultimatum: she either quits drinking or you leave.

My wife has a pretty lenient policy on me fucking around outside the marriage (though it's never come up in a situation that wouldn't have been a threesome). Deciding that the integrity of my marriage was worth more than illicit boi pussy, I approached her about it, revealing for the first time to literally anyone that I've got a bit of a thing for effeminate men. She was shocked, but very kind about the situation, and has given her blessing on swapping pics and stuff, but wants to meet my friend before anything more than that happens.

Also, while these men might be numerous in whatever social circles you go to, not all men are like that.\n\nI've dated two women about six years younger than me, mostly because I was a fucking loser and these younger women were the only ones to show interest in me. In the first case, I was just about to leave college while she was just about to enter college, and in the second case, I was living independently and solidly on a good career path while she was a year or two from graduating college. In both cases, the differences of where we were in life was a pain; we were long-distance, and the fact that they were tied to their college campuses really limited things. They had no disposable income, so I had to pay for everything. I couldn't relate to them about job issues because they had only ever had part-time jobs, if even that. As well as we got along on certain things, the differences of where we were in life was a constant obstacle.\n\nMy current GF, to whom I will be proposing on Monday, is just under a year older than me, and it is SO NICE. I don't have to console her about homework stress or how mean her teachers are. I don't have to help her study for math tests. She didn't have a campus she was tied to, so she was able to move in with me after we'd been together for nearly a year. The similar amount of life experiences we had allowed us to connect more deeply than I ever did with those other women. We can relate about mental health issues we've dealt with, but with the ability to talk about it all in past tense. I've never been happier, and I'm SO GLAD she's so close to my own age.\n\nI'm know not the only person in the universe like me, so yeah, go find guys that aren't preying on younger women.

They aren't losers and are \"forced to\" and desperately wanting a relationship with someone exactly their age. Men date younger women because they want to and they can.

Don't know where to go from here.", "comment": "I think my relationship with my mom is over. (1/3)\n\nBackground: I'm 25. Live in my mom's house with my girlfriend and pay rent. My mom 3000 miles away in NYC, so we're basically housesitting. We also live with my sister's boyfriend while my sister is in Korea for school. My mom gives the boyfriend special treatment, lets him driver her sports car every day, covers his bills, excuses his fuck-ups, etc. But the boyfriend stopped paying his share of groceries and stopped doing his share of the chores, so we asked my mom (the land lord) to take action. \n\nShe did nothing and drunkenly exploded at me, saying that I should be thankful for what I have and that I don't understand the real world and that if I leave her house I \"won't be able to afford to live and will have to live in the ghetto with guns and drugs.\" As things went on, threatening to kick me out of the house has become her signature move for anything. Near Christmas, she drunkenly threatened to kick me out because our dog was left in the backyard for 30 minutes. At some point, I confronted her straight up told her this shit was not going to fly anymore. She blamed it all on alchohol, saying she would never really do that and resolved to do better.\n\nLast month, my mom came out for a week (for work) she insisted that we include the roommate in dinner even though he hadn't paid his grocery bills for over a month. At the same time, she told me that I need to let the boyfriend use my car (I've had it since HS, but she still has the title) because she doesn't want him driving the sportscar because she's worried he'll damage it. When I ask why he can't get a car, she got extremely agressive and said it's her car. I offered to buy the title and she said fine, but that the boyfriend would still use the sportscar because \"it's my car and I choose who drives it.\" When I pushed the fucked up logic of that, she stopped the conversation to say that she's getting a cancer screening and I have no idea what she's going through"}, "replies": [">>23908384\n(2/3) \nPart 2: \nSo my mom is coming out for work again this week and I updated her on the situation that we no longer cook for the boyfriend or allocate groceries for him. I asked her to pitch in (1/3 of the grocery bill, like $20-$25) since I had bought $100 in medications for her this week and not to invite the boyfriend to dinners again. She fucking exploded. \n\nShe sent me long, long text saying that I don't understand how things work in the real world and that it's fucking funny that I have the nerve to ask her to pitch in when she fed me for years. And that it's time for me \"to live in the ghetto like a loser.\" And that I need to find a new place to live. \"This is your 90 day notice.\" All this after she promised multiple times to stop using \n\nThen, unprovoked she tells me how sorry I'm going to be if she has cancer and that if she has a diagnosis then they're going to sell the house and that I'm petty. She went as far as to say that she doesn't need me to pick her up from the airport, she'll just rent a car. \n\nI simply replied \"I literally do not understand where you are coming from.\" And got more of the \"you don't appreciate everything I do for you. You have some nerve. Etc.\"", ">>23908387\n(3/3)\nAnd then it changed course to the roommate. She asked why I'm so jealous of someone who grew up poor and earns minimum wage (he does not, he earns $20/hr and constantly buys VR/Gaming Computer/Warhammer shit).\n\nFinally, I said that this is insane. It's a ridiculous overreation to a simple request. It's crazy that she's willing to give up 2 rent sources (me and the GF), get a rental car, and potentially lose the house (they have financial problems, which is why we're house sitting in the first place) over me asking for groceries. \n\nMy mom sends me the money for medication and says that this is all my fault and that I have no idea what she's going through right now. She says I'm entitled and I \"always cause these problems\" and that I'm entitled and I'm always shitty to her (mostly giving her shit for getting drunk every night when we lived together). She says that \"You have no concept of family or loyalty. Every relationship is a transaction to you and I'm not going to accept your ride from the airport because then you will think that I am in your debt.\" \n\nI probably shouldn't have asked her to pay for groceries, but I really don't think the response was warranted.

She said, however, that if \"I\" (as in me) kicks out the boyfriend (as if it's my decision) then I will have to cover his share of the rent (this is illegal), but that the boyfriend is going to move in with her in NYC in July and that I'll have to pay more anyway. \n\nI told her no and she said, \"I'm not losing the house. If you don't pay rent, your dad want's to sell it, I'll divorce the bastard before I give up the house.\" \n\nSo, while my mom was in the air, I called my dad and told him everything that had happened with the roommate, my mom being mean to me, threatening divorce if I moved out, alchoholism, etc. My dad said that he would get my mom professional help for alchoholism and that he would talk to her about all this shit. \n\nI don't think he ever did.

NONE. \nSay she has some shit like \"loves anime\" on her profile. You could text her \"you love anime huh? Better not be cheating on me with Kakashi (insert crying laughing emoji)\"\nIt's simple and easy. She Will probably reply to that for a few reasons.

You subcommunicate that you don't take yourself too seriously by implying she would cheat on you with a fucking anime character lmfao. Furthermore she doesn't even know you at all and you're saying she better not be cheating on you. It's dumb lighthearted shit like that that chicks love.

In my company, I take care of education and I deal on a daily basis with administrative secretaries, tutors, and IT people and mid-level management to ensure online courses are delivered in a timely manner.\n\nI have to manage a lot of things myself and, sometimes, I have the suspect I am doing other people's jobs. For example, at some stage I had to cater for students IT technical issues because students reported the IT office wouldn't answer their needs.\n\nNow, before you say I am an asshole, I must admit I am completely blind to how my job is perceived by customers. I know for sure I occasionally (bi-weekly) receive letters of gratitude from students. I collect them... You never know.\nHowever, the company does not have in place a system to check if people are doing their job. E.g. there is no IT ticket or tracking system. So it is either the office reads your issue and solves it or it doesn't and never acknowledges receiving your email.\n\nEventually, we came to a boiling point. A new conference app was hauled in and several issues arose because we were given basically no time to practice.

Instead, the issue was not fixed so I faced the problem and couldn't provide students certificates. \n\nAt some stage I had to make a long email in which I listed the entirety of the issue, with lengthy links (each database has a link)... So basically I had to make this long email going step by step on what the problem was and which options had to be reset in order to fix it.\n\nI don't remember my email being specifically impolite. It was just stating facts. I had to send it to different offices because everyone was telling me it was not their problem... So I couldn't figure out who was responsible for fixing the whole thing (who had the \"keys\") of the database.\n\nSame day, I received an informal warning for sending \"harsh emails\" to the secretaries. Also, informally a coordinator told me that since they are all women I need to treat them differently and say cozy things otherwise they would think I hate them. Because they are 35-45 y.o. women who deserve a more emotional approach when writing, and my email writing style does not make this apparent (you have a sample of my writing style here).\n\nWhat do?\nWhy do people treat me like a robot?
