Either way, western music follows a fairly rigid set of rules, but there are too many to learn all at once. Probably a good approach to music self study is analyzing music that you like. Learn what chords comprise the song and what notes make the melody. Everything in music is connected. Notes make up scales which are related to the key of the song which determines the relationship of the chords. With lots of analysis, you may begin to get an \"ear\" or a \"feel\" for music within your chosen genre and can start attempting to create your own pieces.

Someone that shallow, who would dump you over a hobby that is very tame and doesn't prevent you from being a functional member of society (based on the fact that you actually had a girlfriend, even if she was a shrew) and you clearly have employment to live and support said hobby...among your other positive traits (which you know of).\n\nIt will take time, but do something fun to take your mind off this.

Others are right that her response was a bit ridiculous, but there's a reason for everything people do.\n\nDon't do what >>21279280 suggests though.

Apparently she stopped doing that but I've talked to my friend about it and she apparently stole again after I specifically talked to her about it and she agreed to not do it again.\nShe also has a thing for older men than her and dates them exclusively. A pretty weird thing to be into considering she's only about to hit 20 next month. I don't know, she's just very sexually loose and we don't click on that level. I'm more intimate and quiet about sex and what I'm into, and I don't sleep around and she just keeps saying she regrets not being like me in that sense, but I don't know if I can believe her.\n\nSee, I don't know what to think of that. All of those things she's done about a year or two ago, but she's still pretty young and I haven't seen her do these things around me recently, so I don't know if she actually changed over the months we weren't talking to each other, or just got worse and is desperate to get with me, because like I said, we got to become very close friends. We're in the same college and live in the same town for the next few years so I have to decide what to do so its not going to be heartbreaking or awkward", ">>21248573\nYeah I thought of it that way, and a part of me knows for sure that this will become problematic if we do give it a try.

She treats me kind of like a role-model in a lot of ways, always listens to my advice and seems to like how \"good\" I am and she seemed to be regretful when she told me she wasn't like that and she told me about a lot of mentality changes that occurred in her but I don't know if I can trust it.\n\nWould it be a terrible idea if we took it slow and saw where it would go? I mean, the alternative options are telling her its off and we can't be together so she's out of my life completely, or telling her we can just be friends but the way she made it sound, it was more like \"we either keep things the way it is (not talking/hanging out) or we fix our relationship\" so I doubt she'd want to be friends. I think I'll regret not seeing it through and just saying \"no\" to her, but I do understand why it would seem like a terrible idea.", ">>21248596\nSee this is what I want, a mature relationship. I just can't get it into my head that she isn't it. A part of me hopes that she changed over the last few months and I could actually see myself with her. I am even willing to look past the things she's done but to be honest, I wish she hadn't done them. I'm not judging, I'm just saying that our values differ, and I think its important in a relationship to have similar ones no?\n\nThe fact we get along so well and she's the most attractive girl that ever showed interest in me is what makes it so hard. I never had a connection like that, but there again, I never had a female best friend so maybe I just need to find someone and get to know them more and realize that there needs to be more to this girl for me to be happy in a relationship", ">>21248618\n>Would it be a terrible idea if we took it slow and saw where it would go?\nYes, it would be. \nShe's young and doesn't know any better, but her being in a relationship with normal person isn't going to suddenly change her impulsive and immature behaviour because right now she only has an idea that it's not a good thing, not the hard experience that tells her not to fuck random dudes.\n\nIf she doesn't have the sense to realise this or be ok with you being friends, then I doubt anything would've changed if you decided to be in a relationship with her.", ">>21248644\nAlso, we all know it sucks ass not being in relationship with someone special, especially when given the opportunity. \n\nBut believe me when I say that it's not worth the bullshit and drama when she's clearly not ready to grow up yet.", ">>21248652\nGod, I'd hate to admit it but you're right. That was pretty much my initial thought when I tried to figure it out and to see someone else thinks that way just reinforces that belief. \n\nFuck man, seeing her with other guys around college is going to crush me. She attracts guys all the time, she'd tell me like every 2nd day someone asked her out.

Unfortunately, due to personal problems that are now past me, I underperformed greatly on my finals and only got accepted into an ICT course. My only two options now are to either take a gap year or enroll in the ICT course. The thought of being a whole year behind, feeling stuck and watching as everyone else makes progress in their lives just to get to reattempt my finals seems excruciating.

On the other hand, as I want to become a programmer in the future, I could go for the ICT course and then choose some computer science master's. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'd get accepted for such a master's given how different the ICT syllabus is compared with CS. Even if I managed to do that, it looks to me like I'd be at a big disadvantage anyways competing for jobs with people who had started studying programming with their undergrad course, not just their master's.

About 9 months ago when I first started going out with my girlfriend she invited me out to a club with her friends. I have anxiety and I hate night clubs, but overall it was a decent night because me and her snuck off by ourselves to a quiet bar. Her other friends basically did their own thing, on the way there they were talking about sex non stop and meeting up with guys from tinder. By the end of the night we all got a ride home we were waiting in the car for one of her friends, lets just call her x. We had to wait an hour in the car for X before she came back to us. Admittedly we were all a bit drunk but we were all conscious and talking to each other on the way home. My girlfriend had told me the next day that X had in the nightclub fucked two different guys up an alleyway, then later that night had a threesome at someone's house, hence why she arrived back to the car late. The two of us laughed about it but she said don't tell anyone because she was her friend and she has ADHD or some shit, I agreed. The best way I can describe X is she is a walking cliche of Tumblr; blue hair, fat, glass, LGBT, Harry Potter etc. I was always uncomfortable being around her because it was like walking on eggshells, one wrong word and she could go off, she would be the victim and you the bad guy, it would be black and white.\nContinued...", ">>20521039\n(2)\nMe, X and my girlfriend were all working in the same place, made up mostly of students and young people where rumors get spread pretty quickly and everyone gossips about everyone else's sex lives, I'm not saying this is a good thing but that is the workplace culture. Since most of the guys are like 18/19 they brag alot about their sex lives, meanwhile the girls try to keep everything to themselves. Soon after it happened X started bragging about what she did that night, how she was hot enough to get two guys then to have a threesome in the one night. Needless to say she wasn't praised and other people at work started mocking and laughing at her. Before people started laughing at her she was saying \"I wanted to do that because it was fun and it's my choice who I fuck\" to \"I was drugged and raped\". For some reason she then got into her head that my girlfriend was responsible for these rumors because afterwards another girl who is friends with my girlfriend, call her Y, found out. The truth is the real reason Y found out was because X told everyone at work and it got spread around. Even more bizarre she started blaming me and my girlfriend for her allegedly being raped, the reason being was because my girlfriend choose to spend time with me that night, her argument was that my girlfriend should have been looking after her to make sure something like that wouldn't happen.
