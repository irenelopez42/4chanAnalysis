This leads to an almost pathological need to keep as many options open as possible, at the expense of the benefits of commitment. This explains so much of the common stereotypes of millennials that it's almost frightening. This is largely the fault of advertisers, who cultivate this fear in people because it makes it easier to sell things to them.\n\nThus, if you want a truly anti-millennial mindset, there are two things you need to do. One is to cut advertising out of your life, to whatever extent you're able. It's impossible to do it completely these days, but you can get surprisingly close. The second step is to commit. Find meaning in the people and things that you bind yourself to, and honor in the fact that you were willing to bind yourself to them. Don't worry overmuch about missing out on the other things that you could have bound yourself to instead; focus on happiness in what is, rather than on what could have been.\n\nDo this, and millennials will find you utterly incomprehensible, and maybe even a little bit evil.

How can a man be sure he\u2019s not after the \u201cbig rock candy mountain,\u201d the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?\n\nThe answer\u2014 and, in a sense, the tragedy of life\u2014 is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It\u2019s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.", ">>14675868\n\nSo it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?\n\nThe answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on \u201cthe meaning of man\u201d and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term \u201cgod only knows\u201d purely as an expression.) There\u2019s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I\u2019m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.\n\nI\u2019m going to steer clear of the word \u201cexistentialism,\u201d but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre. These are merely suggestions. If you\u2019re genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you\u2019re doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.\n\nBut don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors\u2014 but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires\u2014 including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.", ">>14675868\nI don't get it.

However, every time I ask he gets really sweet and says a singular cute sentence like \"I adore that you like me so much\" or, when I showed him a picture of me at a formal event that I felt very underwhelming in, he immediately said \"You looked stunning =)\" and reassured me and made me feel on top of the world.\n\nJust gotta reassure man, reassure reassure.

We lost contact a bunch of times but eventually became decent friends even though she was still dating this guy I knew.

Her bf knew about it and wasn't very happy. I didn't know what to say because she still had a bf so I just acted indifferent even though her confession made me happy. I thought I was over her but the confession just made everything come rushing back. We got close again after that but I never made a move on her even though I was so tempted.\n\nWell anyway, she broke up with him not too long ago and moved to another city a few hours away. We see each other every once in a while. She always seems happy to see me but she is caught up in her own life. She isn't dating anyone but is casually fucking some guy apparently that she doesn't like too much (she told me, which seemed weird).\n\nI'm just kind of irked by the fact that this tension between us has never really been settled. I want to make a move on her but I figure she has long since stopped feeling that way about me, even though she seems nice and sometimes vaguely flirts with me but I can't be sure. If it was any other girl I wouldn't care and just make a move, I've done it with other girls and been shot down and didn't care. But it's her.

I met these two girls last Thursday at this event and hung out with them for a few hours, then saw them again somewhat briefly the next day. I hit it off with both of them and they\u2019re both cute, and they both showed interest in me and wanted my attention.\nWhen I got home later after I met them I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about one of them, with whom I felt I had a better connection, and I thought that she was into me as well as she did some things like take something from me and then want me to chase her and take it back from her, or pretend to get mad at me playfully several times, little stuff like that.\nAnyway, I messaged her on Facebook the day I met her and she friend requested me and started talking to me, this was the only time she ever initiated conversation between us. When I saw her the next day we didn\u2019t talk so much and I talked more with her friend, while the first girl was kind of just quietly listening, other friends of theirs showed up and were interested in who I was and started talking away to me. But despite the girl I liked and I not talking too much, we exchanged numbers and have been talking on WhatsApp since then, albeit very slowly. Now in about 10 days she\u2019s going on vacation for several months and by the time she gets back I will have moved to another country, so I won\u2019t see her when she gets back (though I\u2019ll visit here in the holidays since my family still lives here.) \n\n1/3"}, "replies": ["So, I wanted to quickly arrange something with her and meet up, since she is an amazing girl and I\u2019d like be able to hang out and visit her in the future, so I talked with her a little casually by text and Sunday I asked her if she wanted to meet up on Tuesday, and she agreed. Anyway, monday she tells me she can\u2019t make it cause something has come up in her family and she\u2019ll be busy with that Tuesday and then apologized twice. I said that it was no problem and we could just do it another day, and she agreed, while not offering any alternative day. \n\nThe conversation on WhatsApp have been pretty in general, with me replying slower but her shorter, and with her simply replying to what I say, without contributing anything herself. We still haven\u2019t talked about scheduling for another day, which generally would tell me that she isn\u2019t that interested, but from how she behaved in person I\u2019d thinks he was, and I think she had a legit excuse not to meet up with me on Tuesday. Also, she\u2019s an alternative chick and so I know she isn\u2019t too popular/busy (while she does know a lot of people) and I\u2019m not a bad looking guy either, and she knows I have a fair amount of friends and go out, so she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m weird or a creep or something.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d think that if she didn\u2019t go on vacation this could all go a lot more casually and more relaxed with more time inbetween but because there is little time I can\u2019t afford to meet up with her right before she goes because I know that when we do see each other we will click amazingly, so I wanted to leave a few days room so that her and I could see each other again after we first met up. Also, she doesn\u2019t know that I won\u2019t be here anymore when she gets back so she\u2019s in no hurry to see me and thus I\u2019m the one pushing for meeting up which does not work in my favor.\n\n2/3", "Anyway I\u2019d like to see her ASAP (but I\u2019m busy Friday), so I wanted to maybe ask her tomorrow if she wants to do something later that day (I know it might be silly to ask a girl to meet up on the same day), but I know that she\u2019s not that busy during the day and mostly just does stuff like mess around on her computer. Also, the fact that it would be rather spontaneous might work in my favor, but if she rejects or something, asking her a third time after that with her showing nothing in return looks a little desperate.\nSo my questions are, from what I\u2019ve told you, 1) does it seem like she likes me? 2) How should I go about asking her out again? 3) Lastly, should I just up and tell her that I won\u2019t be here after she gets back so I want to see her/do something with her before she goes. 4) Should I just leave her be for a few days and ask to something on the weekend, as it might look better after having been talking to her a bit by text. \n\nI know it's a bit long and in unhandy format but any advice you guys can give is much appreciated.\n\n3/3", "Oh and I don't know if it means anything, but on the first day that we met she started taking pictures of me, her and some of her friends, and even a couple of just me when I wasn't looking.

It is a socially acceptable addiction and people pretty much accept it as something that some people do.

I think that porn, like smoking, it not healthy but many people either 1) don't care or 2) don't believe it. PERSONALLY, I believe that pornography is unhealthy for the viewer and indirectly unhealthy for society as a whole (at least in the western world). Think of it like second-hand smoke. I know way too many young girls who are obsessed with being sexually perfect because of the ridiculous images and ideals pushed by the porn industry and, as a consequence, the overly-sexualized, \"perfect\" woman is plastered everywhere and forced in everyone's faces.\n\nI don't think it's out of the question for someone to ask their partner to stop watching porn (but not masturbating). Porn affects both parties, directly or not. If it's causing problems in the bedroom or psychologically, then it's a problem that can be dealt with. But, like asking a smoker to stop smoking, the party asking cannot expect the smoker to quit for him/her, he/she has to quit for themselves and the relationship.\n\nI also think that, without proper sex ed, porn wildly warps the mind of those who watch it. It makes sex out to be this goal or achievement, perhaps reward, that is lifted high on a pedestal. Women are for pleasing men with their holes. I think a lot of porn without sexual education creates sex-negative ideas that harm everyone involved", ">natural\n\nI tell you what is natural.\n\nBeing around naked people is natural, but that's something we never experience in todays society except in very specific conditions and circumstances.\n\nI think that's why porn is so popular.

An accountant can help you do this. The trick is that because you didn't pay taxes on the money you put into the 401K, you'll have to pay when you move it to the rollover account (because you're taking it out of the 401K).
