What more there is to it?\n\n>He was engaged to his exgf which bums\nHe probably danced salsa while wearing pink boots and declared hamlet to her.. does he have to repeat that too so you wouldn\u2019t feel inferior?\n\nHave you ever asked for a mans hand? And then have him fck you over?.... probobly not..\n\nI bet the value of a ring has dropped to floor, and in 2 or 3 years his perspective hasn\u2019t changed. If having a ring on your finger is the only way you can feel trust form him\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t expect that too soon though\u2026\n\nHow long ago did he break up.. I bet he doesn\u2019t want to look like idiot for proposing to a next gf again.", ">>15210582\nThe Rules state that if he doesn't marry you in <2 years, you're wasting your time.\n\n$20 you guys will break up, he'll meet a girl 5 years younger than you, and they'll get married and have a baby less than a year later", ">>15210727\nThere are rules... fkc.. Can I see them.. I've been doing this wrong all my life. god damn it I knew something was off", ">>15210755\nThe Rules is a famous book written in the 90s for women who want to get married. It's literally the first result when you type in \"the rules\" into Google", "They we're engaged about 4 years ago????\nHe's unsure about if we will stay together. Says he's happy but doesn't know if he will be with me for good.", ">>15210780\nTranslation: I'm going to keep Anonette for sex and company until I met the real woman of my dreams, then I'll dump Anonette and marry new girl. Whatever I told her I'd marry her, but it was 4 years ago, obviously no one thinks I'll actually go through with it, not even her if she's let it go on for so long", ">>15210762\nOh.. lel... I can even imagine the people who took them without second thought.. .sad.\n\n>>15210780\n>He's unsure\nThen thats that. That is how he feels. Ask him honesty if that is how he feels or its just fear speaking. Tell him that it bothers you. He wont change his feelings overnight if youre ready to work on that - stay. If you want someone to verbally promise you 4ever&ever and a ring look somewhere else\n\nIts all aobut how you feel.\nIf you tell him that it bothers you and he doesnt want to lift a finger to work on that, you\u2019ll never be happy there.\nWill you feel happy / satisfied if you have to work on this more than you wanted?\nJust ask yourself what makes you happy and if you can achieve it in this relationship", ">>15210503\nFirstly, not all men are going to propose so early in the relationship. While you may be ready to get married, he may not want to yet due to financial reasons or just because it's very time consuming to plan a wedding. I'm assuming you both have jobs, are in college working on a degree, or something of the sorts.\n\nSecondly, is there anything you may have done or said to make him change his mind about getting married? Did he want to any point in time before this?\n\nPerhaps he's not the type to commit, and if that's the case, then do what you have to do. But it's not healthy to go about comparing his past to your relationship. Believe me. I've done that before, thankfully my fiance was understanding of this, but not everyone will be.\n\nAnyway, I really think you need to give him more time. Perhaps someday he'll surprise you. My mom and stepdad were together 8 years before he proposed to her. I know it may be hard for you, but you need to be patient. And if it bothers you that he says he's unsure of marriage, simply ask him why instead of just assuming he doesn't wanna commit on a higher level."]}}
