Throughout this period I have been an incredibly good friend. They have had to deal with transitioning from a woman to a man, family issues etc. and I have always been there for him (I'll use him pronouns referring to my friend). Throughout this time they have generally been a shitty friend. They have caused excessive drama over nothing. They consistently have overreacted to things for no reason. But the thing that really pissed me off is they have a habit of belittling me for absolutely no reason. There is no back and forth, I've never insulted him for who he is and I've always always been there for him. It came to a head about 6 months ago where I flat out said either you stop being such a cunt to me or I'm not interested in staying friends. He apologised excessively, said it was because he was having a trouble at uni (he dropped out of studying history due to difficulties transitioning) and said it was because he was suicidal and depressed that he took it out of me. I said OK, I'll move on, but you need to stop.\n\nFast forward to now and nothing has changed. He still regularly demeans me for being a bit of a neckbeard, for not going out, for being a virgin etc. He made some comment the other day and I flipped out, said that there's no reason for him to say shit like that and left the chat (we use mumble). \n\nHe tried to talk to me a day later acting like nothing had happened. I said it's insulting he acts like I'm not angry and that I don't want to talk to her for a while, that I need some space and for her to leave me be. \n\nThe next few days he has been messaging me frequently begging for me to talk to him again and asking all these questions.

He's a toxic influence around others around him, demanding attention and special treatment while giving nothing in return. \n\nThe difficulty I have is that he is a huge part of our friend group and will always be going to our joint events.

The first two years of university are all bullshit classes that cost a fortune.

Transfer requirements are usually much less strict than straight-from-HS requirements: for example, I never took the ACT/SAT, got shitty (lots of failing) grades in HS, didn't finish some of the requirements for university (foreign language and such), instead went to CC, got decent grades, then transferred into Uni (they never even asked for HS transcripts or a letter of recommendation or anything).\n\nIf you really want to game the system, check the degree requirements against the course transfer guidebook and you can take some classes at University and some at the CC simultaneously, fax credits back and forth, and take advantage of the cheaper tuition.\n\n Tell him to do what he needs to finish high school, but more importantly, start figuring out what he actually wants to do. It's possible he'd be better off just doing trade school, you can make $$$ as a welder or diesel mechanic or plumber or whatever, and be way better off than getting a 4 year degree in History or English or Communications. If he does choose the college route, figure out what prereqs are first in the degree and start independently studying until he can go into those classes at an advantage over classmates.\n\nThe most important part of college, besides the degree is networking, keep in mind.

In my experience women can be just awful at this. They rarely initiate and they can be a bit opaque when they do try, as though he's supposed to just smell that your horny or something. You might also have stopped being sexy for him, in the sense that you never dress up nice, or seduce him, and you're too comfortable around him, so he just sees some of your gross habits and you never trying. If you've put on lingerie for him and tried to seduce him properly and he's said no every time, then that's a problem.

Clearly, he should be putting all the work in and because she's the perfect woman with low sexual needs and a great set of tits.

We both felt that we fitted together very well, we were used to relationships in our friend circles lasting about 3-4 months top, but ours seemed much stronger and after only a year together we talked about marriage, kids and such like it was no big deal. We still do, sometimes.\nIn the beginning of our relationship we had lots of sex, atleast 2-3 times a week. Neither me nor my girlfriend ever had any orgasms in the beginning, me being used to pornography and her having absolute zero knowledge of her own anatomy, and no prior interest in it either. A few months in and I'd gotten over my problems, but hers persisted.

She has always been commited to NGOs like Amnesty and such, and spends alot of her free time working for them. The time we do spend together is often spent at home, just hanging out. We have sex like 2-3 times a month, currently. I do not know if this is \"normal\" for couples like us, I have no friend or such to speak to about this, hence why I'm asking here. We have both still only been with each other. When we sleep together at night I hold her hard and we often fall asleep in each others arms. \n\nMy girlfriend is very \"pure\", in lack of a better word; she doesn't smoke, drink, party, stay out late or eat unhealthy. She dresses very strict, unless I beg her to \"dress sexy\". Never, ever any makeup. I am 110% sure that she has never had any thought about cheating on me or something like that, it just isn't something she would even consider. \n\nSome info about myself might be useful. I look reasonably good, I'd probably be a 7-8. I have a good body, not toned with a sixpack, but rather on the more beefy side; I'm kinda strong and workout often.

She has bought a vibrator, a hitachi I think, but uses it very, very seldom. I think she bought it to make me happy. When we have sex I often, 80-90% of the time, take the lead and she follows me. Sometimes when we have sex she looks very much in pain, but when I stop and pull out she starts crying and says that it felt so good that she just can't handle it. She has squirted two or three times, but only after I used my fingers, never from actual intercourse.

He saw a psychologist for the first time 3-4 months ago. He said it was good for him and it was really eye opening -- that it was totally worth it. He was accepted into law school. Saw the psychologist once more after the acceptance. The session went great, he says. Then he moved for law school.

This gets knocked down a lot with schollies but many have conditions. So, if your brother's stress gets to a bad place and he has a bad year at law school, he might lose his school money and be in a much worse position.\n\nIf he is going to a lower ranked school then he will have some very serious difficulty in the job market. I highly recommend that he read this guide to law student networking: http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=226544 \n\nAs for you I think there is very little you can do other than keeping lines of communication open.

It is insanely competitive out there and unemployment will only be more stressful for him when he is carrying 135k of NON-dischargeable debt. That is right: he will NEVER be able to get rid of his law school loans through bankruptcy.\n\nThere are various federal loan forgiveness/repayment assistance programs if he doesn't get a biglaw job but they are not perfect and he will have a very long amortization on his huge debt. \n\nPeople do make it work from lower ranked schools but they have to hustle constantly.

You apply it twice a day every day for three to six months. Six for the maximum results, three for note-worthy results. It also increases your heart-rate and it may be quite uncomfortable for people with a heart condition, although not life-threatening, it may scare the shit out of you.\n\nThe second type of drug is androgenics, and quite frankly, using steroids simply for a beard is stupid. Is dangerous and you can fuck yourself up permanently. However if you do decide to use them, they have the nice plus that you'll grow more beard than what you're supposed to. But always treat the beard as a secondary objective, with training-related issues and/or health and well-being being the primary focus on your use of steroids.\n\nAs soon as you discontinue roids, however you'll lose all your gains. That includes your beard. Unless you have a nice PCT, and by PCT I mean, minoxidil. It'll permanently make you grow the beard you worked so hard about it.\n\nYou CAN'T grow a beard any other way other than waiting and hoping your genetics help you with that goal.

I need some outside opinions and advice, since my family and friends would be too biased. \n\nI'm dating a guy. We've been together 3 years now, and we're talking about/considering marriage. The thing is, we disagree on the subject of children. I want one kid, two tops. He however wants 4-6 kids. He said he'd be willing to adopt after having his own, making for 6-8 kids. \n\nThis makes a bit of sense considering he comes from a huge family. He has 11 siblings. In his view, supporting a family is easy, and the more family you have, the easier it gets.\n\nNow, he is polygamous, that is, he is capable of loving and wanting more than one woman. He's been faithful to me however, and has told me he'd be willing to stick with just me, so long as I can provide him with children. It sounds a bit cold, but children and building a family/life are the reasons he wants marriage and a relationship. His only condition for tying the knot with me is that if I fail to provide him with kids (due to choice or medical necessity) that I allow him to find a suitable woman to have his kids.\n\nI don't know. I understand his position that if I can't give him what he wants, he should be able to get it elsewhere. I also don't necessarily have something against having a lot of kids. He's capable of supporting them. I'm healthy. It's just pregnancy is an ordeal, and a bit scary, and the idea of doing it several times is worrying. I talked to his mom about it, because she'd had so many kids. She said it is a lot easier than it seems. That if you just let it happen, and don't worry about planning/forcing it, that it comes naturally and easily, and the fear of it goes away.\n\nI don't think he's being unreasonable. It's a hypothetical anyways (if we were to marry, and if I didn't have kids).

He now has a stable position that makes enough money and has good insurance. He can basically ensure me great health care and even a nanny/helper to help me with the kids while I stay at home. ( I currently work, but don't care whether I pursue a career or become a stay at home mom. )\n\nAs for him making demands, he isn't really. He isn't handing me an ultimatum that says \" Have kids or else I'm done\" . He's pretty dedicated to the idea of marriage, and making it work. He is however requesting that if I can't give him what he wants, or refuse to, that I allow him to get it elsewhere. Most likely he would pick a woman to have the kids via a service (where you pay a woman to be artificially fertilized with the parents eggs and sperm). The only way I could see him expecting to have sex with another woman to accomplish this would be if he'd known her for years and was a very close friend. Everyone in that category is pretty much married. She'd have to be exceptional for him to get around that because of how picky he is. \n\nHe's essentially saying he won't stop me from doing what I want and being happy. If I want to work and not have kids, or only a few, that is fine. If I want to stay at home and make a big family with him, that is also fine. He's just asking me to not stop him from being happy as well, in the case my choices don't entirely line up. He's insistent he has no desire or intentions of breaking up or leaving me over this. \n\nI'm just worried because part of me wants to have lots of kids for him, even though I don't personally want to have a ton.

So here's the story I guess: \n\nI am a male, 19 year old living in southern Ohio. I am about to sign up for college but.....its been a long road to get to this point. I was in the military (Army) for 1 year and 2 days, honorably discharged, I have my DD-214 and everything but like I haven't thought too much about it until recently. I was discharged under a condition, not a disability, for mental health reasons. \n\nYa know I really didn't even think too much of it at the time but only until recently did I finally accept that it wasn't even my 100% fault that I got out. I wanted to stay, but I guess the Army thought I couldn't.\n\nSo wait let me back up and give some opening info: Went to Ft. Jackson, SC for Basic with 3-34 Inf Btn and I remember having a Drill Sergeant named Camara. I then went to Ft. Lee, VA for AIT (my MOS was 91B even though I am not a great mechanic nor did I overly enjoy it), was a holdover for what felt like months waiting on airborne. I had started to kinda lose that hooah feeling from when I first got there after all my battles had left, a few of them the same battles I went through basic with. Started to feel alone and depressed being a nerdy kinda loner guy. \n\nFinally went to Ft. Benning, GA for said airborne but, in all honesty, pussied out. I guess I just got to the point of being alone and no longer hearing words of encouragement (which some people need more than others apperantly) that I got REALLY depressed after hearing all the shit talk for pussying out. \n\nSo YET AGAIN, I am a holdover at Ft. Benning, doing shit work around post till they could find me a duty station. Eventually I finally am assigned Ft. Carson, CO.\n\nWhen I first get to Ft. Carson......I feel like absolute shit. I feel worthless (the same feeling I am now), because all that shit I heard."}, "replies": ["But eventually at the Reception Building, I met a Sfc by the name of Gillispie who kinda took me under his wing, seeing how I was so unmotivated and depressed.

All that faith and trust I built up in not only him, but in the Army was gone. I mean I was a Pfc and he was a Sfc? Where was the professionalism? This also brought up a lot of bad memories having been molested by my cousin early in life. So I got into partying, and spending money, and eventually drinking to try and forget it, but I only got worse. Eventually I attempted suicide (pathetically) with pills. I was in the hospital for 4 days in the psych ward and saw therapy for the rest of my time in. Eventually my therapist gave me a choice: Leave the army or stay in. \n\nI chose to stay, but he felt I was too unstable to continue help so I was discharged.", "Now it has been 9 months out and I feel like shit still.

We tried \"staying friends\" for some days but it was really weird for both of us. Then it was escalating a bit again, i asked \"you don't love me anymore do you?\" and she said \"i do\", but the next day when i said i love you she wouldnt say it back, said it would feel like \"going back to what it was\", and that really hurt me. I realize she didnt think too much about me, but it really hurts me when she implies that being together made her less happy, i don't think it's true, i'm pretty sure i made her happy, but she's just in a state of mind where she only sees negatives. You probably know that feeling. All you want is to make her as happy as possible, it's your only purpose, while she feels like she'd feel better without you. It really sucks, it makes you feel worthless, just when she needs you the most and you want to be there for her, she cuts you off. But I guess some people act that way.\n\nAnyway, after that i cut off contact, but after a week or so it was her birthday so i contacted her and we talked again a bit, then she cut off contact, now it's been a week, I'm just waiting for her to contact me back, but if it doesn't happen i don't even care.

Keira understandably does not want her to be there. My boyfriend however feels very much for Mark, as he has been in that position where he really liked a girl and all of his friends ignored her. My boyfriend asks Keira about it, about what's wrong, and Keira gets defensive and says she isn't ready to talk to him, and my boyfriend says he might not be willing to listen if she ever is because she's kept him in the dark for solong.", "Oh gosh thank you guys for your replies! I will try to cut this short!\n\nBasically Keira was really hurt by that and it went south and my boyfriend felt really bad for making her feel bad, and also bad for trying and making things worse and not getting anywhere. This upset me because all he has ever done is try to help his friends, be straightforward and communicate with them, and while I know he isn't the most diplomatic he has never gone in with the intention of hurting anyone. With his ok I went for coffee with her to tell her (in way too many words I think) that I didn't like the way she was treating him (because again everyone rallied behind her and criticised him) and that what she was going through with Mark, I had been there and was here for her if she wanted. In her time with Mark she had talked to.me more and opened up.to me and i didn't want to let myself get in the way of a maybe good friendship with her.\n\nShe said she would talk to my boyfriend when she was ready. 3 months later they haven't spoken, I haven't heard from her. I hear that she has decided who she wants to keep in the loop of her private.life - evidently.not us, and while I'm offended that's just my.pride, because I mostly feel like, good riddance.", "The issue now is that she has been going out with the other friends and not us. This in of itself isn't a problem, but those other friends include my.boyfriend's best friends, Lucy and Carter. Also not a problem except for the fact that they never really follow through on plans with us and yet we see them out with Keira quite often. Keira has been.going.through some stuff so I figured she needed the extra support and they know that. Today though, they were all out together, and while Lucy had been texting my boyfriend, she didn't mention anything about it. This specifically made him feel rejected by them.\n\nI went through similar feelings of rejectionfrom my frfriends and came to the conclusion that I should be focusing on the friends who have always been there forme, I am not very close with them but have made more of an effort to.see them. He says he agrees with that but doesn't know where he would turn, because these friends are all he's got. I think this is something he should talk about with Lucy and Carter, but I also feel like Keira will always be more important to them than him, and I know he deserves better than that. He cares about Lucy and Carter a lot, and I do not know what to say. I feel like they didn't mention today because Keira doesn't want to be around my boyfriend or me. I think she thinks we sided with Mark when all it is is that he has actually talked to us about how he feels or about going out.\n\nI don't know what to ask, really. I feel like the best route is to talk with Lucy and Carter because they're the ones who are important to him, and they would shed light on everything. That it's not all as malicious as I think, since I know I am biased about what it could be.", ">>15475522\nThank you! Forgive my mistakes, I'm on mobile", ">>15475527\nI agree with you, and this is the approach I have taken for myself, but I also feel it is a more cold mode of operation. What I learned from my boyfriend is the importance of communication in relationships, and in being straightforward and honest. I have already been in a situation where I did not do these things, and regret it not for the friendship I lost, but for feeling like I didn't do my best for myself.\n\nI want to say that asking about it might clear up anything perceived as miscommunication or rejection - but right now I feel that the rejection is quite clear, if not the motivation behind it. \n\nI want to encourage and support my boyfriend in taking the actions that he feels are the right ones, that lead to being the best person he can be - he has done this for me time and again. I just have no idea what that would be.", "OP it sounds like Keira might not be close with you and your bf the way she is with your other friends. I wouldn't want to stay friends with a guy who rejected me or his gf", ">>15475655\nI feel like that too. It bothers me because when she was seeing Mark, she talked to me a lot, gave me gifts, wanted to have coffee - even when it became clear that Mark preferred the new girl, too.

It's like, as soon as I expressed an opinion that was not just agreeing with her, she dropped me.\n\nThis doesn't bother me. I gave it a good try and now I know better.

Use a purchased handsoap free of fragrances, because fragrances can trigger allergic reactions, and switch to a towel, but wash it frequently.
