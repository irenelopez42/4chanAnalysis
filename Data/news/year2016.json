Dave Murphy, who is also the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Colleges and Universities, has asked the university to cancel the course, saying it prompts racial division. \"I am extremely concerned that UW-Madison finds it appropriate to teach a course called, 'The Problem of Whiteness,' with the premise that white people are racist,\" Murphy said in a statement this week. He even threatened to pull funding for the state university.The course, taught by Professor Damon Sajnani, is part of the African Cultural Studies program at the university's College of Letters and Science.http://african.wisc.edu/faculty/sajnani\"Have you ever wondered what it really means to be white? If you're like most people, the answer is probably 'no.' But here is your chance!,\" reads the course description.\"In this class, we will ask what an ethical white identity entails, what it means to be #woke, and consider the journal Race Traitor's motto, 'treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity.'\"The course description says it includes readings from W.E.B. Du Bois, Ta-Nehisi Coates and the professor's own article analyzing Rachel Dolezal.cont.

The course is a challenge and response to racism of all kinds,\" read the university statementMurphy also questioned the university's decision to have Sajnani teach the course.\"Even more troubling, the course is taught by a self-described 'international radical' professor whose views are a slap in the face to the taxpayers who are expected to pay for this garbage,\" said Murphy.In his statement, he referred to Sajnani's controversial tweets on topics such as police brutality and the Ku Klux Klan.Murphy was joined in his criticism by Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who wrote on Twitter, \"This is racism against white people. ALL racism is wrong.\"The professor is standing by his class and continues to share messages of support on his Twitter page.\"Good day haters! Keep fueling me with your Tomfoolery. The angrier whites are about interrogating their identity the greater is the need for it,\" he stated on Twitter.\"My only complaint about this course is that I already graduated from the UW and can't take it,\" one person posted.FIN ", " Every time I see things like this I wonder whether it is actually real.

It's been a major topic in recent scholarship with several books published in the last 2 decades on when and how races get defined. It's important again now with the migration crisis in Europe as \"white\" used to be synonymous with \"Caucasian\", but Syria is part of the Caucasus region and now their migrants are being called \"non-white\" in Europe.

Not to mention, without looking at the budget, you really can't be sure to what extent the public pays for the course and to what extent the students themselves pay for the course through tuition. Most public funding goes to stem.Just because they demand censorship, does not mean you demand censorship. you are no better for sacrificing principle and giving in to the will of the mob. yes, if someone developed a course called, \"The Problem of Blackness\"., then there would be attempts to censor it, but that is what we should fight.

For good measure, if you live in country X, \"The problem with Xians\" would be ok but \"The problem with Yians\" would not. So you're asserting a false dualism here.

Course Description: A disclaimer, a warning, an invitation. This class is a challenge both intellectually and (sometimes) emotionally. You will be required to do some heavy lifting: reading for and participating in class each day, mastering the languages and analytical lenses necessary to examine literature and other cultural texts, crafting your papers ahead of time so that you may revise appropriately, making your arguments crisp, clear, and concrete. However, for many, the challenge that this course offers will be internal, delving into the often emotional and psychological sites of discomfort. The texts that we read ask us to consider thorny questions circulating around how power\u2014in the forms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and nationality\u2014functions to open and foreclose meaning in the world in which we live. Are we complicit in the oppression of others? Do I turn a blind eye from my brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 pain? Where do we go from here? Where do we go from here? Where do we go from here? The answer is never an easy one, but for this class, we must move toward the discomfort, excavate its roots, trace its lineages, embrace its fragility. Our journey together may cause a few sleepless nights and reevaluations of long-held, seemingly self-evident truths. Perhaps that is how we will evaluate our success. ", " >>94679>>94679 What is Critical Race Theory (CRT)? Undoubtedly, the US Civil Rights movements saw many significant gains. However, in the 1980s scholars questioned why racial inequality persisted even after formal, explicit discriminatory practices were ended. The result of this query is the field of CRT, which originated at the intersection of legal studies, literary analysis, and critical theory. Today, CRT is a vibrant current of thought in the humanities and social sciences as these fields work to identify and undo inequality. What is \u201cthe problem of whiteness?\u201d The answer to this may be legion. A field connected to CRT, Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) is concerned with dismantling white supremacy in part by understanding how whiteness is socially constructed and experienced. This course is setup to introduce participants to concepts and intellectual threads from both fields. This is not the average literature class. This is a theory class where we will hone our skills in applying concepts from CRT and CWS to literary and cultural texts as well as to the analysis of historical moments. ", " >>94529this. many people do not understand how university administration works (which is understandable). This professor would not still be teaching there if his courses weren't filling, or if his students weren't meeting academic standards. And the complaint that taxpayers HAVE to pay for this course is not entirely true either. While in-state universities are funded by the government (tax money) the amount of money going towards this particular professor and course is nearly nothing. The vast majority of university funding goes towards STEM research, humanities courses don't require much expensive equipment. And again, complaining about not wanting to pay for the course is pretty silly since I'll bet if each American was able to see exactly where their tax money went towards, I bet we wouldn't be much happier. I have helped fund proxy wars in middle east and payed for the bombing of civilian areas, I am not happy about that at all, but I'm not going to stop paying my taxes because of it. That doesn't solve anything ", " >>94682The classes wouldn't fill if students weren't required to take classes like this and the colleges wouldn't pay the professors, if they weren't getting bazillions of tax dollars for free. ", " >>94680>The result of this query is the field of CRT, which originated at the intersection of legal studies, literary analysis, and critical theory.AKA: Blame Whitey... ", " >>94689Not quite;It's more about gaining critical thinking and knowledge of other cultures and races, as opposed to \"white supremacy\" and \"white genocide\" that torn the world apart (especially in Europe and other colonized nations). ", " >>94541Not a counter-argument, you know full well that a university, public or private, is by far different from public school, not to mention a change in subject. A University has a far broader curriculum where you can find courses on creationism(ever heard of religious studies?), much of it payed for by tuition, sports, and other revenue streams. Furthermore, much of the money Universitys get is mandated for fields such has STEM.Unless you research UofWM's budget, which I'm sure you have not otherwise you would have released figures to challenge me, you can't really be sure how much of your money went directly towards, if any at all, this particular course and as such your grounds for demanding the Uni censor it or else democratically voting to cutoff funds if the course isn't removed is shaky at best and not legal at worst. Who are you to demand the University stop teaching the course, if it relies on tuition and other revenues or if you did not directly pay for it?If you want to debate public schools, that's a different matter. Regardless, while defunding a University over a course may be legal, I don't think we want to start such a slippery slope. What if someone defunded a Uni because of a course called, \"The Problem of Blackness.\" Can you not think of any problems within the black community that should be focused on in such a course? The \"Problem of Whiteness\" could be one of them. ", " >>94687I'm not sure on the specifics of UW since I didn't go there, but most universities will have a certain amount of credits in certain fields that are required for graduation, the specific courses students take to fulfill those requirements is up to them. Rarely do universities have a single course that is required by all students to graduate. And it's not like anybody is being forced to go to any particular university, or go to university at all. And those \"bazillions\" of tax dollars they get \"for free\" is embarrassingly little, in comparison to other first world countries. Considering how much money the US puts toward our military to occupy foreign countries and get involved in foreign conflicts, getting upset over a professor teaching a course that you don't agree with (and probably know very little on the subject he is teaching) is pretty insignificant ", " >>94554Peer councilors, hell even another professor. >\"Oh, well there are other courses you can take if you want an easy 4.0\"What bothered me the most was they didn't even understand concept of the course: we actually had some really good conversations about the matter.

It's the same thing as religious fundamentalists electing to skip conversion of adults because they can't form convincing arguments to instead brainwash children and teenagers with Bible verses. ", " The entire premise of this class is bullshit to begin with. It's not \"Whiteness,\" that expands its definition to encompass more and more immigrant demographics, it's the simple concept of assimilation and integration.The original culture of the US was Anglo, Protestant, and Republican (as in anti-Monarchy). Every group of immigrants that differed from this trend was viewed with skepticism not because they weren't considered \"White,\" but because it was questioned if they could assimilate properly. Benjamin Franklin was wary of the Germans, many were catholic, they came from places with nobles and monarchs and they did not speak English and were not part of Anglo culture. Lo and behold they anglicized and assimilated and so were accepted. After them it was the Irish, catholic and fiercely anti-Anglo, but they too assimilated. The Poles, the Italians, the Russians, the Scandinavians, they all in turn assimilated. Granted this was easier to do if you share the same phenotype as the original Anglos, but as time has progressed that has mattered less and less. Asians and Latinos properly assimilate all the time these days.What this class is designed to do, is to break the White demographic into ethnic subgroups ripe for exploitation by identity politics. Notice how they frame Whiteness as an opposite to Blackness and how the formation of one necessitated the other, yet they are only calling for the dismantling of one. It's designed to break the nascent racialization of the White demographic's political power in the wake of declining White demographics while preserving the unitary political power of other groups. ", " (cont)Some might point to the difference between White and Black origins in the US, that Black Americans have had their origins obscured from them by slavery masking their true roots while Whites have not. While that might have been true once, it's not so much anymore. White Americans actually have very little to no connection to their European ancestors customs or the customs of modern day Europeans. For generations now White Americans have been the descendants of not just one or two or even three European ethnicities, but dozens and from every corner of the continent. There's absolutely no way to break the White American demographic into ethnic subgroups while paying any sort of attention to the actual genealogy of said people.Contrast to that, Black Americans almost universally hail from Western Africa. The knowledge of which of the many cultures, traditions, histories, and civilizations in that area they descend from might be lost due to slavery past, but in this day and age, a general knowledge of the area and its past is not any more or less informative to Black Americans than the generalized study of European history is to White Americans with half a dozen or more ethnicities in their makeup.Both groups use the vague ideas and histories of where they come from to form identities. Using a public institution of learning to teach one demographic that it must fracture along nonexistent lines as a matter of morality is nothing more than political guilt-tripping for the sake of petty tribalism. Militant progressives have noticed that while their identity politics have formed monolithic blocs out of minority demographics, it is starting to do the same with the white majority that has comparatively and historically been varied in political stances. This class is designed to try and curb that natural response and keep the White demographic in disunity because the sheer numerical voting power it wields would spell doom for their policies if it turned on them.

It didn't make much sense to begin with, it's not about to start making sense now (and don't let economists try to tell you otherwise.)Money is a measure of value, worth or otherwise some kind of benefit. Shit people want. This can take the form of something like convenience. If you're willing to give up something that is valuable or important to you in exchange for something else, such as a convenience, then it has value. Thus the only true sources of value are the land/resources, labor, resource-multiplying or labor-saving technology, and sign value which are status goods and luxuries. Money simply attempts to express this quantitatively. It doesn't actually come from thin air. Unsurprisingly, it's very hard to \"accurately\" quantify value, so there are constant and unpredictable shifts, corrections and adjustments.Whether UBI comes into being or not, the one key advantage it would have over socialism is that it doesn't do away with the market.

If we replaced all cashiers and drivers (taxi, truckers, etc) with automated systems, what do you think the ratio of technicians to machines will be?

I can imagine that we could sort of collectively refuse the fruits of automation as part of some social contract to sustain each others' livelihoods. So that we wouldn't be totally dependent upon those that own the means of production to voluntarily provide for our interests.But I don't think that's a sustainable plan, because one can foresee us getting lazy, and we would just start embracing complete automation again little by little and then head down the same road.Even if we could prevent that, it'd kind of be nice to be totally independent of work for survival. Working can be really good and healthy on many levels, but in a fully automated society, we'd be free to live and work as we please.

Why shouldn't society cut this useless mass then? The productive members will be far better off without this detritus, and the stress should motivate people to work harder. I am not advocating actively killing them, but merely letting starvation and exposure from homelessness play itself out will be enough.

If we don't make technology to make our lives easier, healthier and overall better, ultimately culminating in the highest state of well-being that we can achieve, then there is no point in making technology in the first place.

We know that, because it has helped us do that to a certain degree so far. But why stop here? ", " >>92628Technology and labor exists as a means to an end; not the end itself.The purpose is to enable humans to live as fulfilling a life as possible (and I would include in that to reduce the suffering of all living things in so far as possible). Hopefully we can all be free from the need for our labor to earn a living. But we can't get there if we're so overcome with greed that those of us at the top can't tolerate continuing their services a bit longer to enable those at the bottom of the skill tree to become a part of the post-scarcity world.What frightens me is there appears to exist an absolute disdain in large swathes of the US society for the weak and defenseless so that's not an encouraging sign.Then again, the US government now appears to favor a strategy of corporate favoritism, discouraging even high-skilled migration, ending subsidies to renewable energy technology and minimizing government investment toward the health and productivity of our citizens. So I don't see how the momentum that has carried us ahead of the pack since WW2 can sustain.

That's what /pol/ is for. Can you honestly not find some news about this that came out in the last 48 hours? I'm sure there are many developments on the fake news epidemic, which should be the focus point, and not revisiting old news to opine on it.

Noone wants important news to get buried in other news that more people are talking about.

You can STILL go to that thread and talk about it. It will probably bump too. If there isn't a cutoff point for news stories, then /news/ becomes pointless. It becomes a board simply for editorializing and not talking about current news. You may think it is critically important, I think it is too, which is why I would pay attention to developments in past 48 hours on the fake news epidemic in general and post it to this board, to keep people continuously informed and to keep the discussion rolling. We should not be posting the same thread about Hillary Clinton and her opinion, because then we just start bickering about Hillary rather than discussing important developments in the fake news 'epidemic'. Nonetheless, old threads are bumping probably because this is a slow moving board.If you want to bicker about Hillary, /pol/ is perfectly fine for that. I've had many decent conversations about her there and had many a good conversation ruined by ridiculous pizza gate jew-scare posts too. But, alas, that is the nature of 4chan, you can only constrain boards so much or it loses the principle of openness. Without a time constraint for /news/, it will simply become and offshoot of /pol/.

First of all, the context in which our constitution was crafted was a society in which citizens did not have the power to directly elect the head of the executive branch. That was intentional to prevent a foreign power from influencing the electorate against their own interest and to prevent a populist demagogue that would seek to disintegrate the democracy from being elected. The founders were well aware of human nature and understood that risk. We no longer enjoy that protection so we depend on the electorate to will the continuation of our Republic and the interests of our people.Secondly, the digital medium of the internet has fundamentally altered the means by which humans consume information in ways that the constitution could not have been crafted to anticipate. Just three decades ago, everyone consumed their national news from the same several networks that could easily be held accountable for false reporting. None of that holds true anymore.The fact is, government is no longer the only source of censorship that society need worry about. Concerted efforts to flood out factual information with misinformation is now feasible and effective and unsurprisingly we see exactly that tactic being taken advantage of by parties with ulterior motives than simply serving news. It has effectively the same outcome as officially mediated censorship and propaganda.So what is the alternative other than to hold news media accountable for the truth value and intention of the views they propagate to some extent? We need to strike an optimal balance. ", " >>94268>Since when does the public need to be babied?

If it's important enough, I'll research it on my own. Every human being should be doing this, rather than blindly trusting the news outlets.Since we gained the technological power to annihilate the biosphere. \"We'll learn from our mistakes\" and \"oh well, if our society fails, the world will keep going\" can no longer be taken for granted. We can't assume the constitution will be forever relevant as is. That's why there is a process for amendment. And yes, there are grave dangers there too. But again, we need to find a balance. There is no perfect answer.Even if it's against the letter of the law proposed by our founders, it is in its spirit.

That is what motivated them at penalty of death to found a new type of country. If anyone understood, it would be them. ", " relevant>>90580 ", " >>94300This. The Founders preached Democracy yet created the Electoral College to pick the President, not even specifying that the general population should vote for electors, because they didn't trust the general population of the time with having necessary or sufficient information to make national-level decisions. And based on education and communication standards of the time, they had a point.Obviously when education and communication improved, as they did very quickly, the popular vote tied to the electoral vote solidly. But now we have this situation where even though we're well-educated and have information available if we want to research it, the communication methods have suddenly fallen to shit -- fake news is just the phenomenon tipping the past year, but the past 20 years has had deliberate disinformation campaigns on global warming, politicians' war records, history itself (i.e. the Civil War, rose-tinted glasses over Reagan and Kennedy). So yes, people are talking about regulating how mass media is done.Personally, I think the answer will be in a mix of technology and web infrastructure rather than top-down regulation.

It started with the CIA saying it might be Russia since they have been known to do this in the past.

It probably took longer than expected to get the dirt on Comey put together into a nice little info graphic to get him on board. This all begs the question- why did Clinton deflect all attention away from the content of the emails instead of addressing what is in the emails? The emails prove how corrupt she is.

Needless to say, the self-deprecating description has little to do with reality. The Israeli-American billionaire is one of Hillary and Bill Clinton\u2019s largest and closest donors. So close he got to spend the night at the Lincoln bedroom in the White House when Bill was president. So close that he could pick up the phone and tell the presidential candidate to stop shouting after listening to her speeches on the campaign trail. Over the weekend, Saban hosted in Washington the 13th annual policy conference carrying his name. The Saban Forum is a mostly closed-doored gathering where Israeli and American politicians, policymakers and opinion leaders get an opportunity to discuss the region\u2019s future while schmoozing at a fancy hotel, a block from the White House. For Saban, this year should have been special - a chance for the man closest to the next president to usher in a new era of influence at the highest echelons of power. cont. "}, "replies": [" >>91302Instead, the meeting took a somber tone. From the empty seats during the conference\u2019s closing session, to the unmistakably disappointed tone used by Secretary of State John Kerry when discussing the future of the Middle East peace process. The Clintons, who had hardly ever missed a Saban gathering, were nowhere to be found. \u201cThis could have been such a great celebration,\u201d said a participant who has known Saban for many years. \u201cHaim could have played a huge role on pro-Israel issues if Hillary won.\u201d His access to Clinton seems unparalleled. Wikileaks hack of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman\u2019s emails reveals how Saban communicated directly with the candidate and her top advisers, providing his input on issues relating to Israel and to the Latino community (Saban is chairman of Univision, the largest Spanish language TV network in America.) Clinton and her advisers, the emails suggested, always responded, mostly positively, to Saban\u2019s suggestions. In the new reality facing Democrats, Saban, who has famously said he is a \u201cone issue person and that issue is Israel,\u201d has already found himself a new cause within the party. He is now determined to prevent the election of Keith Ellison to chair of the Democratic National Committee, an appointment Saban fears would signal a Democratic shift away from its pro-Israel stance. cont. ", " >>91303\u201cIf you go back to his positions, his papers, his speeches, the way he has voted, he is clearly an anti-Semite, anti-Israel individual,\u201d Saban said Friday night, offering his views during a question and answer session with Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman. \u201cWords matter and actions matter more. Keith Ellison would be a disaster for the relationship between the Jewish community and the Democratic Party.\u201d The comment may give some indication of Saban\u2019s future role in Democratic politics. After more than two decades in which his involvement was based primarily on supporting Bill and Hillary Clinton, Saban may go back to focusing on his prime cause in politics - backing Democrats who share his pro-Israel positions and opposing those who do not. Hawkish on issues relating to Israel\u2019s security but an ardent supporter of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Saban could easily see during the weekend conference how his causes are under threat from both sides of the map. In his own political home, the Democratic Party, debate over Ellison\u2019s views on Israel has raised once again the possibility that progressive Democrats, less committed to automatic support of Israel, will gain power and shape the party. And on the Republican side, hints being thrown out by the incoming president and his advisers have also been a source of concern to supporters of an American push for resolving the conflict. In one of the closed-door sessions at the Saban Forum, an adviser to Trump refused to fully embrace the two-state solution or to accept that it was the only option for resolving the conflict, according to two participants who attended the meeting. cont. ", " >>91304Saban has proven his ability to adjust to political realities in the past. He was initially skeptical about President Obama\u2019s approach to Israel, but eventually warmed up to him and contributed generously to Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. A person in close contact with Saban said the Los Angeles-based billionaire is not thinking yet of a new candidate he\u2019d support for the 2020 election. \u201cHis only goal is to make sure the party stays pro-Israel,\u201d he said.

On Monday, AT&T introduced its new Internet TV service, called DirecTV Now, with the exact kind of favoritism regulators had opposed.>But AT&T isn\u2019t likely to get in much trouble. The wheels of justice at the Federal Communications Commission, which sent the letter, grind slowly. And advisors for the incoming Trump administration have already called for repealing the net neutrality rules, a move also favored by Republicans in Congress.>The companies most likely to be in trouble are AT&T\u2019s competitors in the Internet video market. They can\u2019t offer their customers the same deal DirecTV now subscribers will get without paying through the nose.>AT&T formally unveiled DirecTV Now at a media event in New York on Monday. The service offers over 100 channels of typical cable fare at a starting promotional price of just $35 a month. But the price goes up to $60 when the promotion ends, and there are a number of limitations on the service in the early going.>The controversy stems from AT&T\u2019s decision that customers of its wireless service who sign up for DirecTV Now will be allowed to watch as much video on their phones as they\u2019d like without counting against their monthly data allowances. AT&T T -0.33% wireless customers who use competing services like Sony\u2019s SNE -0.27% Vue or Dish Network\u2019s DISH 2.74% Sling TV, don\u2019t get the same benefit.

The other major broadcaster, CBS, however, is an exception. CBS CBS 0.84% does have its own Internet TV service, called CBS All Access, and it has not yet signed on with DirecTV Now. CBS declined to comment.>AT&T and Verizon VZ -0.31% , the two largest wireless carriers, have increasingly been using so-called zero rating as a strategy to bolster the popularity of their own mobile video services over the past year.>By doing so, the carriers benefit in two ways. Current wireless customers are more likely to use the carriers\u2019 own video services over competitors. Plus, people who sign up for the video services may be more likely to pick the carriers for their wireless service. The FCC, which adopted the net neutrality rules last year to prevent systematic discrimination against any online content, hadn\u2019t objected until the letter it sent to AT&T this month.>AT&T says zero rating is a benefit to consumers since it allows them to watch more video. And the practice isn\u2019t discriminatory, the company argues, because competing services can get the same treatment if they agree to cover the cost of their customers\u2019 data usage, as AT&T says it does for DirecTV Now. In a reply to the FCC last week, AT&T said it had \u201cfaithfully adhered\u201d to the rules and maintained that the FCC\u2019s interpretation was a \u201cradical departure from established law.\u201d>Fortune reached out to AT&T for comment on Tuesday and will update this story if a reply is received. The FCC is still reviewing AT&T\u2019s response to its letter and had no further comment, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday.... ", " >The FCC and some outside observers have argued that the way AT&T is using zero rating is discriminatory. There is no cash cost to AT&T from zero rating its customers\u2019 video usage, while competitors would have to pony up big bucks to get the same treatment, they say. The cost of matching the zero rating benefit alone could \u201crender infeasible\u201d other services\u2019 attempts to match DirecTV Now\u2019s $35 price point, the FCC noted in its letter.>The FCC, however, is about to undergo a braintrust transplant\u2013one that is likely to help AT&T in this case. The letter challenging zero rating was written under the administration of FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, who was also a strong proponent of the net neutrality rules.>But within months, President-elect Donald Trump will appoint his own chairman of the agency. And in addition to his general hostility to government regulation, he has named two ardent opponents of the net neutrality rules to oversee his FCC transition team. Either of the transition leaders, Jeff Eisenach or Mark Jamison, could end up as FCC chairman.>And that would leave AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now with its big advantage\u2014and competitors at a big disadvantage.

In the figure, China exported $286.86 million worth of goods to the North, up 16.1 percent on-year, and imported $238.38 million worth from the North, up 27.6 percent from a year before, the data said. The monthly increase marked the third in a row since August, when the bilateral trade marked a 29.9 percent rise on-year in sharp comparison with a 9.1 percent drop in April following the U.N. Resolution 2270 adopted in March against the North's nuclear test in January. The figure also posted an 8.1 percent decline in May and a 15.7 percent decrease in July, except for a 9.4 percent hike in June. In particular, China's exports of construction materials and vehicles have been noticeably on the rise, which apparently has something to do with ongoing bilateral infrastructure construction projects in their border areas.http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2016/11/25/0401000000AEN20161125006900315.html ", " >China's October coal imports from North Korea up on month after falling in September China's coal imports from North Korea rose in October after falling more than a quarter in September from the previous month amid a push from the United States to punish North Korea for its recent nuclear test. Coal imports from North Korea climbed 1.22 percent in October to 1.82 million tonnes compared with September, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed on Friday. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9, and said it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile.China expressed anger with North Korea for the test, its largest to date. China's coal imports from North Korea fell to 1.798 million tonnes that month from 2.465 million tonnes in August.Earlier in the year, China said it would comply with U.N. sanctions and ban coal imports from North Korea following Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test in January, although Beijing has made exemptions based on \"livelihood purposes\".Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing after the figures were released that it was not the statistics people should be paying attention to, but whether the coal trade was legal. \"China has consistently fully and conscientiously carried out the U.N. Security Council's resolutions on sanctions on North Korea,\" Geng said.Products like coal with a civilian purpose that do not benefit the nuclear and missile programs do not fall under the sanctions mandate and Chinese imports accord with those rules, he added. \"We uphold that the U.N. sanctions on North Korea should not have a negative impact upon livelihoods in North Korea or humanitarian needs,\" Geng said.http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-northkorea-coal-idUSKBN13K138 ", " >>87793You know whatI think North Korea has something against America.

B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila\u2019s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for.>In October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila\u2019s financial district \u2014 a 57-story symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan \u201cLive Above the Rest.\u201d And now his partner on the project, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.>After the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the president-elect\u2019s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio\u2019s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including Trump-branded resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio\u2019s son Robbie Antonio said.>\u201cWe will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,\u201d the elder Mr. Antonio, one of the richest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his star-studded celebration in Manila.>Mr. Antonio\u2019s combination of jobs \u2014 he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect \u2014 is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table.>Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged \u201ca separation\u201d from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years\u2019 time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration.... "}, "replies": [" >Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. >They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.>\u201cIt is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,\u201d said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department.>The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.>In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business \u2014 and his family\u2019s ability to keep it running after he takes office.>\u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201d>In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.... ", " >\u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said.>But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.>In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake \u2014 is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project.>Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India \u2014 where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America \u2014 are being built through companies with family ties to India\u2019s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans.>In Ireland and Scotland, executives from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. >Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail\u2019s habitat \u2014 a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States.... ", " >And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump\u2019s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. >More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup \u2014 the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.>Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It\u2019s two.\u201d>These tangled ties already have some members of Congress \u2014 including at least one Republican representative \u2014 calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them.>\u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,\u201d Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. \u201cIf you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp\u201d... ", " >David J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump\u2019s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency \u2014 and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad.>\u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said.>Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.>\u201cThe working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,\u201d said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cThey will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.\u201d>At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.... ", " >Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president?>What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization\u2019s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders \u2014 of Turkey, Argentina and Japan \u2014 having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide.>Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.>Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels.... ", " >\u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d>Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in.>\u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201d....

Now imagine regaining that sensation, a decade later, through a mind-controlled robotic arm that is directly connected to your brain.That is what 28-year-old Nathan Copeland experienced after he came out of brain surgery and was connected to the Brain Computer Interface (BCI), developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC. In a study published online today in Science Translational Medicine, a team of experts led by Robert Gaunt, Ph.D., assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Pitt, demonstrated for the first time ever in humans a technology that allows Mr. Copeland to experience the sensation of touch through a robotic arm that he controls with his brain.\"The most important result in this study is that microstimulation of sensory cortex can elicit natural sensation instead of tingling,\" said study co-author Andrew B. Schwartz, Ph.D., distinguished professor of neurobiology and chair in systems neuroscience, Pitt School of Medicine, and a member of the University of Pittsburgh Brain Institute. \"This stimulation is safe, and the evoked sensations are stable over months. There is still a lot of research that needs to be carried out to better understand the stimulation patterns needed to help patients make better movements.\"This is not the Pitt-UPMC team's first attempt at a BCI. Four years ago, study co-author Jennifer Collinger, Ph.D., assistant professor, Pitt's Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and research scientist for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, and the team demonstrated a BCI that helped Jan Scheuermann, who has quadriplegia caused by a degenerative disease. The video of Scheuermann feeding herself chocolate using the mind-controlled robotic arm was seen around the world. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161013151356.htm "}, "replies": [" Before that, Tim Hemmes, paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, reached out to touch hands with his girlfriend.But the way our arms naturally move and interact with the environment around us is due to more than just thinking and moving the right muscles. We are able to differentiate between a piece of cake and a soda can through touch, picking up the cake more gently than the can. The constant feedback we receive from the sense of touch is of paramount importance as it tells the brain where to move and by how much.For Dr. Gaunt and the rest of the research team, that was the next step for the BCI. As they were looking for the right candidate, they developed and refined their system such that inputs from the robotic arm are transmitted through a microelectrode array implanted in the brain where the neurons that control hand movement and touch are located. The microelectrode array and its control system, which were developed by Blackrock Microsystems, along with the robotic arm, which was built by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, formed all the pieces of the puzzle.In the winter of 2004, Mr. Copeland, who lives in western Pennsylvania, was driving at night in rainy weather when he was in a car accident that snapped his neck and injured his spinal cord, leaving him with quadriplegia from the upper chest down, unable to feel or move his lower arms and legs, and needing assistance with all his daily activities. He was 18 and in his freshman year of college pursuing a degree in nanofabrication, following a high school spent in advanced science courses.He tried to continue his studies, but health problems forced him to put his degree on hold. He kept busy by going to concerts and volunteering for the Pittsburgh Japanese Culture Society, a nonprofit that holds conventions around the Japanese cartoon art of anime, something Mr. Copeland became interested in after his accident. ", " Right after the accident he had enrolled himself on Pitt's registry of patients willing to participate in clinical trials. Nearly a decade later, the Pitt research team asked if he was interested in participating in the experimental study.After he passed the screening tests, Nathan was wheeled into the operating room last spring. Study co-investigator and UPMC neurosurgeon Elizabeth Tyler-Kabara, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor, Department of Neurological Surgery, Pitt School of Medicine, implanted four tiny microelectrode arrays each about half the size of a shirt button in Nathan's brain. Prior to the surgery, imaging techniques were used to identify the exact regions in Mr. Copeland's brain corresponding to feelings in each of his fingers and his palm.\"I can feel just about every finger -- it's a really weird sensation,\" Mr. Copeland said about a month after surgery. \"Sometimes it feels electrical and sometimes its pressure, but for the most part, I can tell most of the fingers with definite precision. It feels like my fingers are getting touched or pushed.\"At this time, Mr. Copeland can feel pressure and distinguish its intensity to some extent, though he cannot identify whether a substance is hot or cold, explains Dr. Tyler-Kabara.Michael Boninger, M.D., professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Pitt, and senior medical director of post-acute care for the Health Services Division of UPMC, recounted how the Pitt team has achieved milestone after milestone, from a basic understanding of how the brain processes sensory and motor signals to applying it in patients ", " \"Slowly but surely, we have been moving this research forward. Four years ago we demonstrated control of movement. Now Dr. Gaunt and his team took what we learned in our tests with Tim and Jan -- for whom we have deep gratitude -- and showed us how to make the robotic arm allow its user to feel through Nathan's dedicated work,\" said Dr. Boninger, also a co-author on the research paper.Dr. Gaunt explained that everything about the work is meant to make use of the brain's natural, existing abilities to give people back what was lost but not forgotten.\"The ultimate goal is to create a system which moves and feels just like a natural arm would,\" says Dr. Gaunt. \"We have a long way to go to get there, but this is a great start.\" ", " >Electronic old men and their flexibility.webmseriously this is awesome and at the same time a somewhat scary inch closer to the dystopian cyberpunk future ", " >>78642we may not be able to contain the augmentation project ", " >>78577>brain computer interface helps paralyzed man feel againGod I wish I could post a wojak.

Academics believe that the huge shipyard, which includes nearly 270 slipways, could shed light on the 400-year \u201cDark Ages\u201d of the Mediterranean over 1,000 years B.C. \u201cThis is the one and only in the world. The biggest shipyard that has been proven archaeologically in the world,\u201d said Hakan \u00d6niz, the head of Sel\u00e7uk University\u2019s Underwater Archaeology Department.\u00d6niz said they had started underwater works on the coasts of Mersin in 2015 in an attempt to discover archaeological artifacts and prohibited areas for diving on the coasts of Mersin, particularly in Silifke. He also added that they had determined the existence of archaeological wreckages in the region. \u201cBut the most exciting for us was an iron spur that we found at a depth of 35 meters and that was used as the weapon of warships in ancient ages. Such an iron spur has been found for the first time in the world,\u201d \u00d6niz said. The team has carried out works from west to east on the Sel\u00e7uk 1 Scientific Research Ship and is continuing to work around the Dana Island, located two kilometers off the coast. \u201cWe were surprised when we found dozens of slipways in the northern part of the island in 2015,\u201d \u00d6niz said, adding that they were still working to determine the exact period these structures date back to.\u201cDuring works in 2016, we also unearthed a huge shipyard where 274 ships could be built at the same time. It is the only such shipyard in the world. We are continuing work to try to date it. Most probably it is the oldest shipyard in the world. We estimate that it was used around 1,200 B.C. in the Late Bronze Age,\u201d he said. http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/huge-ancient-shipyard-unearthed-on-turkeys-dana-island.aspx?PageID=238&NID=105120 "}, "replies": [" Island of the DenyenStating that the Dana Island most probably was known as the island of the Denyen, named the \u201cSea People\u201d in the 12th century, \u00d6niz said the Denyens were first mentioned by the Hittite King Telipinu around 1,500 B.C. \u201cThe Adania region, which King Telipinu mentioned, is the region of Adana and Mersin today,\u201d he added. The reason why this era is called the Dark Age is that we have limited archaeological information about a period of around 300-400 years. Most probably a big drought, earthquakes or epidemic disease occurred in the 13th century B.C. We can deduce this from the fact that Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II had to send ships full of grain from the Alexandria region, which is usually productive and suitable for agriculture. Ancient sources suggest there was a famine around this era, \u00d6niz said. Probably the Denyens, together with other groups suffering from the famine, attacked Egypt in order to get grain. Ramses III said the Egyptians defeated the Denyens and he sent the captured Denyens and others to remote regions as soldiers. He pursued the other Denyens to their island in the north and destroyed them there, he added. But this story is not limited to the Deneyns and the Hittites. We know of the existence of the late Hittite kingdoms in the Cilicia region in the Iron Age. We know that they resisted against the New Babylon Kingdom that wanted their iron and grain. The name of the island became Pitusu in the Iron Age. The King of Babylon Neriglissar described Pitusu as a mountain in the middle of the sea. He said he attacked it and 6,000 soldiers on this small island resisted against him. The existence of those 6,000 people reveals that the island continued serving as a shipyard in the Iron Age too, \u00d6niz said. History effectively stopped on the island around 800 years ago. And the modern law of the Turkish Republic does not give permission for any work or restructuring on the island. It is now completely a part of the world heritage, he added.

It\u2019s been more than five decades since the screwworm last infested Florida, and I\u2019ve grown up hearing the horror stories from the last occurrence,\u201d said Adam Putnam, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture.Officials plan to keep the infestation from spreading while eradicating the New World screwworm flies from the affected Keys. They will trap flies to determine the extent of the infestation, release of sterile flies to reduce the population and disease surveillance to find other affected animals.  Using sterile flies to breed the insect out of existence has worked in the past. The USDA used the technique in Florida in 1957. By 1959 the flies were gone. It was used more extensively throughout the south and southwest to completely rid the area of the insect by 1982.While not considered an infestation, the screwworm has been found in the U.S. since then. A dog that entered the country from Trinidad and Tobago in 2007 was found with screwworm larvae. Another dog was found with screwworm larvae in 2010 when it came to the country from Venezuela.\u201cThis foreign animal disease poses a grave threat to wildlife, livestock and domestic pets in Florida,\u201d Putnam said. \u201cThough rare, it can even infect humans.

She was briefly questioned on the issue of her private email during the interview.Messages contained in a trove of Podesta\u2019s emails made public by WikiLeaks in recent days show how Clinton campaign staffers sought to craft and control the former secretary of state\u2019s message on the issue. The directors of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security have accused \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials\u201d of hacking and leaking emails posted to Wikileaks and other sites to influence and interfere with the 2016 election.An Aug. 21, 2015, email exchange centers on a script addressing Clinton\u2019s email use and shows Palmieri worrying about reporters chasing \u201ctangents.\u201d\u201cStill think it is way too long and has too many tangents that are distracting and press will chase,\u201d Palmieri wrote of the draft statement. \u201cAlso I don\u2019t think it has our core argument that nothing she sent or rec\u2019d [received] was classified at the time.

While the bureau faulted Clinton and her staff for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of sensitive information, the FBI did not recommend the Justice Department pursue charges in the case. ", " Clinton said that she chose to use personal email at the State Department because of the convenience of carrying only one device. Investigative materials made public by the FBI earlier this year identified 13 different mobile devices associated with Clinton\u2019s phone numbers that could have been used to access emails on her personal system.The email issue has continued to dog Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The newly leaked emails also show that it raised questions among Clinton insiders.For example, Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally and head of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, wondered in an email to Podesta last year why Clinton didn\u2019t turn over her private server to a third party.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she just turn the server over to a third party at this point?\u201d Tanden wrote on Aug. 12. \u201cIsn\u2019t it going to leak out of the FBI anyway?\u201d\u201cDone so think about something else,\u201d Podesta wrote in response.After Clinton\u2019s private email use was revealed by the New York Times in March of last year, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) asked the former secretary of state to give her server to a third party for a \u201cneutral\u201d investigation of its contents.

At a Goldman Sachs Alternative Investments Symposium in October 2013, Clinton almost apologized for the Dodd-Frank reform bill, explaining that it had to pass \u201cfor political reasons,\u201d because \u201cif you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it\u2019s all the fault of Wall Street, you can\u2019t sit idly by and do nothing.\u201dClinton added, \u201cAnd I think the jury is still out on that because it was very difficult to sort of sort through it all.\u201dClinton praised Deutsche Bank in a 2014 speech for \u201cthe work that the Bank has done in New York City on affordable housing.\u201dWhile Deutsche Bank has given to anti-homelessness campaigns in the past, it was also cited in a New York State Senate report in January for refusing to maintain foreclosed properties in New York City neighborhoods and costing those communities millions in unpaid fines.

As The Intercept reported in July 2015, Nides moved from chief operating officer at Morgan Stanley into Clinton\u2019s State Department, and when Clinton left Foggy Bottom, Nides went right back to Morgan Stanley as a Vice Chairman.Clinton joked about the \u201cculture shock\u201d for Nides, working a government job. \u201cYou should have seen his face when he learned there were no stock options at the State Department.

Clinton did not publicly confirm or discuss her use of the email server until March 10 in a speech at the United Nations, nearly one week after AP revealed the server's existence.WikiLeaks began releasing on Friday what it said were years of messages from accounts used by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. He has acknowledged his emails were hacked. Podesta warned that messages may have been altered or edited to inflict political damage but has not pointed to any specific case of this.Months after Merrill's message, the campaign was still preoccupied with emails. In May 2015, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted other staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton's work-related emails by January in response to requests by news organizations. http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2016-10-11-US--Campaign%202016-Clinton-Podesta%20Emails/id-5c086b47d0ed4e9c90508a71302d6d9d "}, "replies": [" Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote that unspecified \"DOJ folks\" told him there was a court hearing planned soon in the case. The name and email address of the person who shared the information with Fallon had been deleted.Donald Trump on Tuesday called Fallon's email \"unbelievable,\" and his supporters said it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clinton's campaign.The dates of court hearings would have been publicly posted in advance on the court's docket. Fallon did not respond to a request for comment from AP. The Justice Department declined to discuss Fallon's email.It wasn't immediately clear who hacked Podesta's emails, though U.S. intelligence officials last week blamed the Russian government for a series of breaches intended to influence the presidential election.Through its Twitter account, the Russian Embassy in Washington has denied any role in the cyberattacks, suggesting U.S. officials are just \"whipping up\" anti-Russia hysteria.The messages stolen from Podesta's account describe how Clinton's closest advisers considered responding to key events during the campaign, including the discovery of her email server and her congressional testimony over the deadly 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.In emails from March 2015, Merrill suggested a strategy \u2014 ultimately nixed by Clinton herself \u2014 of having comedian Larry Wilmore and Bill Clinton joke during an event for the Clinton Global Initiative charity in Coral Gables, Florida, before having Clinton join them on stage.Merrill laid out the scenario in emails to Podesta and other aides: \"Wilmore could sit down with WJC and Chelsea and say something like 'Thanks for having me here, it's a pleasure. And I should tell you, I just emailed HRC (I hear she's a big emailer), and asked if she'd join as well. (Laughter).'\" He added that Hillary Clinton could then walk out \"to applause.\" ", " \"It would be just light-hearted enough while giving her the opportunity to address this seriously, be a little conciliatory as discussed, and then get back to a discussion about CGI etc.,\" Merrill wrote in the email.In the end, Hillary Clinton's team drafted talking points Clinton used at the news conference at the United Nations.Clinton said she \"fully complied with every rule that I was governed by\" and that \"there is no classified material\" among her work-related emails.Both of those statements were later proved false.The State Department's internal watchdog concluded in an audit released that Clinton ignored clear written guidance that her email setup broke federal record-keeping rules and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers. The FBI's recently closed investigation concluded that more than 100 emails exchanged through Clinton's private server contained information that was later determined to be classified.As the email controversy escalated in the summer of 2015, Clinton herself seemed slow to grasp the continuing political damage. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri in August expressed concerns that Clinton \"wasn't in the same place\" on the issue as some on her campaign staff.At the time, the political aides were working out details of revealing that Clinton had directed her staff to hand over her server and a thumb drive with copies of her emails to the Justice Department. Palmieri was writing other campaign aides to arrange for a Univision reporter to ask \"a few questions on emails\" during an interview that would otherwise focus on college affordability.\"As you all know, I had hoped that we could use the 'server moment' as an opportunity for her to be viewed as having take a big step to deal with the email problem that would best position us for what is ahead,\" Palmieri wrote. \"It is clear that she is not in same place.\" ", " >>78073>ap linkNice, you are learning, young /pol/lack.

Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the Sept. 11, 2012, attack.\"We might consider softening the 'Chris did not believe retreat was an option \u2014 and neither do I' line,\" wrote Katherine Turner, a law partner of Clinton's personal attorney David Kendall. \"I don't think we want to suggest that there was a commitment to be there at any and all costs.\"Following Clinton's tense Oct. 22 testimony, Podesta proposed in an email that she could publicly joke, \"I used to be obsessed with Donald Trump's hair, that was until I got to spend 11 hours staring at the top of Trey Gowdy's head,\" a reference to the slicked-back white coif of the South Carolina Republican who chairs the committee.Other Clinton aides shot down the idea.\"I love the joke too but I think HRC should stay above the committee,\" adviser Jake Sullivan replied, \"and especially above personal insults about it.

Camarota noted that Clinton could potentially add as many as 10 million new immigrants to the U.S. during her first term alone, on top of the millions of illegal immigrants to whom she would grant immediate amnesty.Camarota's analysis is based on recent data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Census Bureau. According to the most recent DHS available data, nearly 150,000 immigrants from the Muslim world permanently resettled in the U.S. in 2014. He explained: \"While Clinton has not spelled out her long term plans for how many Syrian refugees she would take into the country, the number who could come from that country is certainly enormous,\" Camarota added.If the same policies were followed in Clinton's second term, roughly 1.7 million migrants from the Muslim world could potentially arrive during two terms of a Clinton presidency. http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/26/immigration-expert-u-s-resettle-nearly-one-million-muslim-migrants-one-term-clinton-presidency/ "}, "replies": [" USA destabilized the Middle East and caused people to flee their countries so it's only fair that they take in all refugees, even the ones already in Europe.

In 2010, the US was 0.9% Muslim - assuming this proportion holds true today, with our ~318 million population, that means about 2.862 million Muslims. And considering that Hillary plans to bring in even more non-Muslim immigrants, the actual percentage of Muslims in our population may even decline. Adding 2 million Muslims and 25 million non-Muslims will give a total population of 345, with about 4.862 Muslims, or 1.4% of the population, slightly higher than Ireland. Whereas Germany is 6%, France is 7.5%, and Italy is 3.7%. ", " >>71713>the actual percentage of Muslims in our population may even declineThis is simply absurd. Let's do a little math.There are currently ~3 million Muslims (you can't get four significant figures out of the estimates you've provided) in the US. If one million Muslims enter, that's an increase of about a third. If the total percentage of Muslims declines, then the total population must increase by more than a third. That would be a total immigration wave of more than 100 million in one year, which I think you'll agree is absurd. It doesn't affect the rest of your post, but let's drop that suggestion.>Possibly, but it would probably be due to public paranoia/panic rather than any actual real effect it has on the countryWell, yes. Since the \"actual real effect\" would happen AFTER she would be elected, it would be rather difficult for that effect to travel backwards in time and kill her candidacy.You are, however, setting up a false dichotomy between \"actual real effect\" and \"panic\".

It is not manipulated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And anyone who suggests otherwise is either uninformed, or trying to misinform others.>Which is to say that you shouldn't listen to Donald Trump & Co. For a year now, the alleged billionaire has insisted that the \"real\" unemployment rate is something like 42 percent instead of the 4.9 percent it actually is. He hasn't said how he's gotten this \u2014 maybe it's from the same \"extremely credible source\" who told him President Obama's birth certificate was fake? \u2014 but the simplest explanation is that he's just ballparking how many adults don't work. That's 40.4 percent right now. The problem with using that number, though, is that it counts college students and stay-at-home parents and retirees as being equally \"unemployed\" as people who are actively looking for work but can't find any. So it doesn't tell us too much, at least not on its own, unless you think it's a problem that we have more 70-year-olds than we used to.... "}, "replies": [" >Or unless conspiracy theories are one of your favorite accessories, as seems to be the case with the father, and now the son, Donald Trump Jr. On Sunday, he told CNN's Jake Tapper that the official unemployment numbers are \"artificial\" ones that are \"massaged to make the existing economy look good\" and \"this administration look good.\" How do they supposedly do this? By, he claimed, defining \"the way we actually measure unemployment\" to be that \"after x number of months, if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously off\" the jobless rolls. The only problem with this theory is it's false. The BLS hasn't changed the way it measures unemployment during the Obama years, and there is zero evidence it has changed the numbers themselves. Not only that, but Donald Trump Jr. doesn't even seem to know how unemployment is defined in the first place. As the BLS explains, everyone who doesn't have a job but is trying to find one counts as \"unemployed.\" It doesn't matter how long you've been looking as long as you are, in fact, still looking.>But that's not to say the unemployment rate tells us everything we need to know about the labor market. It doesn't. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will tell you that herself. There are still a lot of people who want full-time but can only find part-time jobs. Still a lot of people who want to work but weren't able to find anything for so long that they've given up looking for now. And still a lot of people who would want to work again if wages were high enough to make it worth their while. But none of this is a secret. The BLS publishes all this, too. So-called broad unemployment includes all these people who technically aren't unemployed but aren't fully employed, either. That's 9.6 percent today.... ", " >Even more damning than that, though, are the millions of people who \"should\" be working but aren't. Those are the 25- to 54-year-olds who, for the most part, are too old to still be in school, but too young to be retired. In 2000, 81.9 percent of them worked; in 2007, 80.3 percent did; but only 77.8 percent do today. That adds up to at least 2.5 million missing workers.>Where have they gone? Well, some of them are probably people who decided to go back to school. Others are probably parents who felt like they had to stay at home since their wages wouldn't have covered the ever-increasing costs of child care. And the rest are probably people who are still waiting for the recovery to reach them. Indeed, as you can see above, the share of 25- to 54-year-olds who have a job has only made up half of the ground it lost during the recession.>The boring truth is that the economy is in a lot better shape than it was when Obama took office, but that it could be in better shape still. The recovery, in other words, still has a ways to go. But that's a lot different from saying that we have 40 percent unemployment and that the government is trying to cover it up. That just suggests you don't understand \u2014 or don't want to accurately describe \u2014 how stats work and you don't know how to look up the ones you think the BLS is hiding.>It's not what you'd expect from a major party presidential candidate.

I'm sure there's even a good number of white people who are super insecure about how they make black people feel and want to reassure them, which probably ends up coming across as socially awkward.When I was young and not tainted with the medias portrayal of dependent/suppressed people, I was never like \"wow a black person did dat in history?? But they are less then white people---how???\" I knew everyone had that human potential in them, and I was never surprised about the success of the Civil Rights movement.It's the damn movies, television shows, school systems (which are setting everyone up for failure but the lower income areas get it the worst because generally the worst teachers are there) that help facilitate the dark cloud.

There is an agenda to deliberately divide the nation and create racial warfare. What do you think the results will be of teaching blacks that they are the victims of a society which systematically discriminates against them because it was created only for the benefit and privileges of white people? Whites are being beaten down with the nonsense that they are born racist and they unknowingly discriminate against minorities, while blacks are being taught to be revolutionary activists. The result is a generation of white people afraid to speak out and made vulnerable to the hostilities of minorities that are taught to hate them. The very premise of white privilege education itself is racist because to believe that one race has privilege over you or is somehow better than you is to be filled with self loathing and self doubt. In other words, the left is pushing a belief based on evolutionary theory that suggests black people are not as capable as white people and that, in order to survive, they need the hand of an all-powerful government giving them handouts. What this has done in reality is destroy the initiative of generations of blacks, who are now so dependent on government welfare that they blindly vote for the ones who keep them in this state of dependence. The creation of the voter class, or generations of government dependency, is done on purpose in order for a community organizer like Obama to bring them under his umbrella and turn them into a revolutionary army that would create the necessary chaos needed to secure total government control.Expand Your Mind ", " >>64295>Brit>Not being cucked by mudslide of mudslimesYou can pick only one ", " Feel free to explain your irrelevant comment or statement.

He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the Mujaddid (renewer) of Islam, the promised Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Muslims.Similarly there is a world of difference between the apostolic Christian Churches (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and The Assyrian Church of the East) which have the same Christology and the 30,000+ protestant denominations which popped up in the last 300 years after Christianity has been established for over a thousand years with radically different theologies.

American intervention in the Middle East and North Africa - Arab societies do not feel a strong sense of statehood because their nations were so arbitrarily created, so this does not unite them. Instead they feel united by their religion - Islam. When one Muslim county is attacked it feels like an attack on other Muslim countries because of this strong sense of brotherhood Muslim nations feel for each other.2. The rise of Islamophobia and culture of fear. Whether or not this is justified is not important, but it has undeniably made Muslims feel more radical because it creates the narrative of being oppressed which encourages people to defend the thing which they feel strongest about - their religion. As we said before, Muslims feel much more loyalty to their religion over their nationality. If you create a society, as France has, which implies you have to choose between being Muslim and being American, a Muslim would always choose to be Muslim.

Bush's Iraq War, which destabilized Iraq, disenfrannchised the Sunni minority in Iraq, and by policy prevented many Baathists from getting honest work in Iraq. ISIS's early gains were due to Baathist intelligence agenst knowing which buttons to push to get sunni tribal leaders in Iraq and Syria to allow them to rule.ISIS then benefitted from Obama's premature withdrawal from Iraq, which among other things further disenfranchised the Sunnis when Maliki essentially purged them from the commissioned ranks of the army and police and pretty much ignored sunni regions when it came to the things people actually want from a government (sanitation, safety, that sort of stuff)Obama and HRC's abortive support of the Arab Spring destabilized Syria, giving ISIS a place to metastasize, and laundered support via Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia that went first to \"Moderate rebels\" then to Islamists and finally to IS helped them develop into a coherent force. Erdogan and Turkey buying IS oil after they split from the Syrian opposition and allowing foreign fighters into Syria was the lifeblood of IS through 2014 and 2015.Finally, while Trump is a visible source of anti-islamic rhetoric, he's hardly the only source, and blaming him for anything assumes that in his absence, ISIS would not be able to find the appropriate galvanizing opposition elsewhere, which is clearly false as they were able to convince tens of thousands of foreign fighters to move to Syria in the years before he arrived.Tl;dr You're full of shit.

Listen up, muslims: convince your brethren to knock this shit off yesterday, quit justifying their \"anger\" while telling us you of course don't approve of violence, quit telling us how fucking peaceful Islam is.

They do not want a mingled, \"diverse\" society. I'm amazed that liberals still don't get this.Regardless, if they want a binary society, I'm game. As an American who has had enough, I for one will resist the Islamic agenda with every fiber of my being, using every legal means at my disposal.

The white-supremacist snipers would be able to hide their skin color, escape with the secret assistant from certain police officers, and use the police officers to set up a black scapegoat.A loosely-organized guerrilla organization without military training cannot possibly carry out a successful sniper attacks with its high risk.

So instead, he stepped in front of the dog and met the mother bear head on, like Douglas greeting Tyson.SuppliedOn Tuesday, Nelson spoke to the National Post about what happened next and what was going through his mind when it did.NP: Can you describe for me where you were and what you were doing?Nelson: I was in the Panache region. It\u2019s a hunting area with trails running through the bush. I tied the dog up to a tree and I sat down on a log and \u2018pop!\u2019 out comes a cub\u2019s head. Now, I can\u2019t run because I\u2019ve got a cliff behind my back. And I\u2019ve got my dog tied to a tree. And she can\u2019t go down the cliff with me. So all I did was step in front of my dog. And I could hear the bear crashing through the brush to get into the clearing.NP: Were you consciously thinking through how you were going to react at that point, or was it pure instinct?Nelson: I was thinking through it enough to look around and see if was there anything I could use as a weapon. http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-man-survives-battle-with-mother-bear-by-scoring-two-punch-knock-down "}, "replies": [" But after that, no, it was pure instinct. So the mother (a black bear Nelson estimates at about 300 pounds) came crashing through and I knew it meant business. This thing didn\u2019t stop. It didn\u2019t stomp. It didn\u2019t snort. It just came straight at me. When it stood up and took its first swing with its left paw, it hooked my front shoulder and as I swung around I went to hit it but I missed because it hit me so hard. I hit it in the lip and teeth, which actually did a lot of damage to my knuckle. And it went down.NP: Sorry, it went down or you went down?Nelson: It did. It swung. It went down. I hit it. It came back up again. It swung again, this time with its right paw. And it just vaguely caught my back because I was trying to roll away from it. And that\u2019s what gave me a second shot. This time I used my hand in an uppercut and hit it right in the snout. And it just sat down on its butt.NP: In that split second after you caught it with the uppercut, what were you thinking?Nelson: That\u2019s the first moment where I felt fear. Up until then, I just thought, \u2018OK, I have to get ready, here it comes\u2019. But in that moment, when it turned around and looked at me, I thought, \u2018Ah, shit.\u2019 You know? What\u2019s it going do? But right then the cub called again. And the bear just turned around and walked away, like it had never even met me.Nelson suffered some minor scrapes and one deeper cut in the fight. He washed his own wounds in a nearby stream and patched one with a bandage. He didn\u2019t go to the hospital. He doesn\u2019t blame the bear, he said. It just did what came naturally.Nelson: Honestly, a bear attack like I was in, that\u2019s a perfect storm. You just couldn\u2019t get a worse scenario. Just like I was protecting my dog, it was protecting its cub.

Not that men routinely had their eyes and testicles removed and swapped places for others to find.In the US, we have a tendency to portray interracial conflicts as always having an evil oppressor (self-hating violent whitey who should now be ashamed) who was victorious over a noble minority (in-touch-with-nature Indians who cried when white men littered).

They willingly traded everything they owned... . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... . They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.

Why do you even think African slaves were brought to the Americas in the first place. After indians proved to not last under harsh treatment and disease, African were brought as replacement slaves. Of course, to a denialist (not even revisionist at this point), self-defense of invading forces is justification for further aggression, disregarding the original agression intended and carried for Europeans.Now, you readily pit the blame on Spanish and expunge the English, but in fact the English were worse than the Spanish because at least the Spanish tried to integrate and convert the natives under their control (the ones that survived anyway) while the English had a strict segregationst and force displacement policy--or else.

He destabilized the Middle East, causing every radical organizations to try and grab territory that had recently been vacated. His administration instituted the use of torture, which poisoned America's name overseas and crippled our ability to gain vital info - torture doesn't work, whereas the previous methods did. His administration was plagued by scandal, and I don't mean there were a few things that the Democrats never shut up about, which is what that phrase usually means, I mean there was a new one every month and a number of people went to jail. Bush completely mishandled Katrina and a few other disasters. He caused the Great Recession. His vice president shot someone in the face. He alienated America's allies, like France and Britain.Bush was so bad he handed Obama his first election for free. A major issue during that election was, did X candidate vote for Bush's politics, and would he continue them? The Bush administration was so bad that when a later administration says that some of the country's and the world's problems are the result of Bush's mistakes, years after, they're probably right.

People remember two things specifically, him looking from above looking at the damage presumably to make him look more sympathetic but backfired horribly and the media had a field day. They also remember that \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\". Even though many people laughed at that, it was believable to most casual observers not involved in politics. >Trickle down economics >Bush directly caused economic turmoil.We could go on for threads about this, but treating Bush's fiscal policy as an outlier from his predecessors or successors isn't exactly correct. Congress, banks, the fed, all had a role and all of that has been hashed out endlessly. All that said, if Obama's administration had the scrutiny like Bush had, you wouldn't look at the guy you responded to like that.

With his landslide election the dems took the house and senate in a supermajority, and the GOP response was to institute a policy lockstep obstructionism with 100% backing by Fox News. Obama didn't help the extremely partisan situation by pushing through Obamacare, but he indisputably helped the country (we desperately needed health care reform of some sort and Congress had been stalling for over 20 years, and even Romney's platform was to not abolish it, just the tax penalty).No scandals or anything to harp on, some more liberal agenda stuff, but Obama stayed away from pushing executive authority before the midterms. But then losing the House and the supermajority fucked things up, because the lockstep GOP policy didn't change, and it ended up de facto requiring all legislation to have 60 Senate votes, which meant nothing got done.

It had long been unclear if such a tape exists, despite years of searching by the so-called \"death hags\" on Findadeath.com.Yesterday, we got a call that confirms the tape's existence. While reporting the original story we had reached out to Mollie Nelson, the widow of the owner of Chubbuck's news station, but never heard back from her. She called us back Tuesday to explain that she has the video \u2014 her late husband Robert Nelson had kept a copy of the tape all these years, though Mollie says he never told her why.When he died, it stayed in her possession. But after the Sundance debut of the quasi-documentary Kate Plays Christine, in which a former news station employee suggests that Nelson might have the tape, people started contacting her asking to see it. The attempts made her uncomfortable, so she gave it to an unnamed \"very large law firm\" for safekeeping. She says she has no plans to ever make it available and only held on to the tape to honor her husband's wishes.

What if you choose to strike first because you feel threatened for your life or your property? Essentially, do stand your ground laws affect a police officer?Let's add some scenarios.1. Officer is in uniform (could be on duty, could have just finished his shift, may not be an officer at all... costume or some shit.2. Officer is not in uniform but you know he is indeed an officer (not a fraud, etc).3. Officer has a personal problem with you (a girl, argument, doesn't really matter - enough for a confrontation) So bottom line is you kill the officer in your home and your only evidence is your word and whatever can be gathered from the scenarios I listed above.Just brain farts forming a question really.Don't compare to any recent pig on nigger action. That is rarely ever in a home and situation where the officer has indeed felt threatened by a nigger.Mainly it is a question if you can defend yourself against an cop with any expectations of the judge or the following investigation leaning in your favor?

Defense Department researchers determined that she carried a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic colistin, according to a study published Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology. The authors wrote that the discovery \"heralds the emergence of a truly pan-drug resistant bacteria.\"Colistin is the antibiotic of last resort for particularly dangerous types of superbugs, including a family of bacteria known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, which health officials have dubbed \"nightmare bacteria.\" In some instances, these superbugs kill up to 50 percent of patients who become infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called CRE among the country's most urgent public health threats.Health officials said the case in Pennsylvania, by itself, is not cause for panic. The strain found in the woman is treatable with some other antibiotics. But researchers worry that the antibiotic-resistant gene found in the bacteria, known as mcr-1, could spread to other types of bacteria that can already evade other types of antibiotics.Is this the year we see the end of the world, or is it just another scare?

When we look at surveillance data for certain infections like streptococcus that cause meningitis, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections, the frequency of those infections has increased over time. We're seeing a rise in antibiotic resistance for all age groups and for a number of different bacteria.Sometimes, the infection might be due to a catheter.

Because the northern hemisphere is warming just enough to bring those plants out of permafrost and other such natural events that kept them from decaying in the first place.The funny thing about letting plants rot that have never rotted for millenniums is the fact that it creates a pretty fucking huge cycle of CO2 output.

Fungi and microorganisms responsible for decomposition produce more CO2 when they consume that same dead material, which just re-releases it back into the atmosphere. It does not leave the system.The only way I know of where CO2 actually gets stored permanently (it never really leaves but can be locked up) is due to certain ecological mechanisms that are very complicated to explain but basically have to occur at the bottom of large bodies of water such as oceans. Though the changes in the global biosphere are threatening those systems' ability to sequester CO2 as efficiently as they could.

It definitely will adapt and survive, whether or not humans will withstand that change remains to be seen. ", " >>41556lel plants needing CO2 is anecdotal ", " >>41597To summarize that process: Phytoplankton absorb CO2, as plants do, into their tissues. CO2 becomes various types of long chain carbon molecules. That carbon gets consumed by microscopic crustaceans also present in the ocean environment, which continue to be consumed all the way up the food chain. The vast majority of these small crustaceans don't get consumed or only get consumed by slightly larger carbon-rich shelled organisms that end up sinking to the ocean floor where they become the ocean sediment. Over millions of years this builds up and is compacted to form rock with high carbon content. Atmospheric CO2 becomes rock in oceans. This is the main permanent method for how much of atmospheric CO2 is absorbed and leaves the system. What occurs on land with plants may temporarily be stored as carbon in soil, but is often re-released during decomposition, or through other human activity such as farming.

Vodafone, which owns 45% of Verizon Wireless, pays taxes on its share, but the entire profit is reported on income. Adjusting for this, Verizon's effective tax rate is closer to 30%, the company says. Verizon is buying Vodafone's stake, which will eliminate the issue in the future.

Indirectly, this could help employers, tax payers (an educated workforce may mean more people in Ontario getting decent jobs or more businesses relocating to the province), more educated citizens may be better at making choices when it comes to voting, saving, and health practices, and so forth. Mind you these are all possible indirect effects.As for the gas tax everyone is directly effected by this. I'd personally like to see more people in Toronto on bikes, on the street cars (we need twice as many street cars), subways, etc. rather than driving around.

That would hinder the family as opposed to being useful.Also plz ban shitty useless courses, make trade school free, we need tradesmen not historians. ", " >>25602The cost is negligable, I rent in north york toronto a 2 bedroom around 850sq feet for 1250 a month, I pay 650 and I consider my place pretty big. Similar apartment units in pickering might be 50 dollars or 100 dollars cheaper, but taking a 7 dollar go trip to union and then a 3 dollar token to work, thats 20 dollars a day or 400 dollars a month at a 5 day work week. Driving could potentially be cheaper if you have free parking at work and your insurance premiums are low, but it'd probably be around the same. So take that 400, I use 40 subway tokens in a month to get to work, which is 116 dollars, even if your apt is 100 dollars cheaper in rent to actually get to the city to work is still going to hover around 150 dollars more, with the lack of benefit that living in the city provides.Personally I'm a 6 minute walk to the station and a 10 minute walk to a grocery store, so assuming you can find a good place to live with a decent rent, it can be worth it to live in the city compared to outside of it, at least as far as renting goes.But theres a bit of hope for public transit, the eglinton LRT line should be done next year, and if that is successful we may have a lot more options.I do agree with the GOtrain though, if you buy a monthly pass its clearly for work, and that price should be reduced compared to single fare riders. I don't even buy a toronto metropass because I lose a bit of money every month buying one. ", " >>25583To explain what's going on a bit more:Tuition is free. But the cost of living is still on loan.While tuition would cost something around $4.5k per semester for STEM students, the cost of transportation, food, school supplies and other expenses will be on loan.This applies only to what the school directly charges you.Students will still have to take out loans. From my person experience, if tuition was free, I'd have to pay around $4k/year just for school.For a medium/high income household, that $4k/year is nothing. They can write it off.For a low income household, that $4k is still a major deal. But it's less of a deal than $13k per year.>>25632Tution is a small part of the cost of university. Especially if you live on campus, as in most colleges/universities dorms in cities cost more than tuition. This is coming from your own pocket or you can take a loan for it.I'd say even $50k a year would still be hard to manage if your kid was living on residence and had to pay $12k/year on rent, $4k on living costs, equaling to $16k/year. This isn't even including tuition.Also, they won't pay off 100% of tuition if your parents make more than $50k, but they'll give more grants, so you only have to pay a portion of it. I saw an example in which one person's parents made $80k/year, and the student had to pay only half their tuition.

It amazes me that people seem to believe our only function in society is to find a narrow place in the division of labor and become a robot. I don't know about you, but I have a role as a worker, but I also have one as a friend, son, citizen, community member, and so on. Without a decent liberal arts education my ability to play all my roles would be much more difficult (or I would do a much shittier job).Adam Smith pointed out (while cheerleading for capitalism) that it makes the workers stupid because workers are expected to only know how to perform one small task really well. Being highly skilled in one small narrow aspect of the division of labor leaves us incompetent in many other fields. This is worrisome since we are part of democracy where we, as citizens, need to vote, need to elect leaders that have ideas on to solve problems. Without a strong understanding of history, politics, geography, sociology, and philosophy we can be (easily) fooled by dubious leaders and ideas.I mean do you think the Americans would have been as gung ho on invading Afghanistan if they knew the Soviet Union recently engaged in a failed 10 year war/occupation with the nation? Would they have believed an easy victory would occur in Afghan if they had any understanding of the nation's history from 1900 on? How deep the internal fractions were and how strong the external pressures were on the country?Would Toronto's transit system be better if we had more average citizens understand what solid transit systems look like? I mean it makes sense our transit system is weak compared to many Euro cities and our last mayor wanted to make it more accessible for cars because ummm, he likes his oversized and overpriced auto (brilliant! more cars is what every city needs).

As for Africa, I'd imagine since China is making huge inroads to developing stronger relations with countries on the content it might be smart for us to understand the culture and the history so we can combat China's (soft) power in the region. Understanding how Euro colonialism affected the people and their nations may be smart for dipolmatic and business reasons. Also, when one of our leaders wants to create some sort of agreement with an African nation or enter into a war/conflict or invest in one of these nations, it might be a good idea if we have some clue what is going on there. So we can vet the leaders ideas on some level. If we have no clue what is going, we can be told any bullshit story.If you are talking about blacks in America, I'd imagine having an understanding of a group that makes up a significant portion of the American population might be smart. (unless you enjoy being shrouded in ignorance). Maybe, if we understand how slavery, jim crow, the ghetto, and the war on drugs has affected the black community we can figure out a way to help solve some of the chronic issues that plague poor black urban areas. Maybe if we understand why blacks and whites often see the world through very different perspectives, we can come to a common solution and move forward as a society. Unless that is you think the current relations between the two groups are stellar and everything is going A-OK. ", " >>25804>>25825>anthropologyguess what companies spend a lot of money on? Market research. Anthropologists can (and do) get paid to do research on consumers and groups of consumers. Selling something to a consumer is a lot easier if you have some idea of their wants, needs, ideologies, and values. For a specific example, Nike hired anthros to conduct reseach on skateboarders because their award winning campaigns weren't convincing skaters to buy their shit. After the anthros studied the group, Nike was able to dominate the market and develop a fairly loyal consumer base which was once very hostile to the company.Additionally, guess who else hire's anthopoligists? The military and private security companies in order to understand what the fuck is going on with the locals in key regions. If we want the locals to support us, to dislike our enemies, we should probably have a decent understanding of their culture. I mean who would guess that understanding the culture, values, and ideas of people in a region where a complex was is going on would be beneficial to the citizens and the politicians and the miltary?

Also when it comes to finding a lady to marry or have an actual relationship with, understanding some of the issues she faces might help. Or understanding some of the shit our moms went through might help us there as well.second, understanding gender might help us understand why men aren't making it through college at the rate that women are. it might help us understand why men now have lower IQs on average than women.

Rejecting the proposal reinforces the political strength of any party that does so, widens its base and keeps it in power, but Trump either doesn't get this or doesn't care because again he knows business and pandering to the market is what's important in business nvm that it might be retarded.If Trump had just STFU and sold it as an anti-gun and anti-narcotics wall while talking to the Mexican Government bout the consequences on the down low once he won the presidency it might have worked but at this point?

Sponsored data is like toll-free calling, where the provider of the content, rather than the consumer of it, pays the cost.>\u201cGo90 has decided to take advantage of Verizon\u2019s FreeBee Data 360 service, which allows them to pay for customer\u2019s data usage associated with watching videos on the Go90 app,\u201d a Verizon representative told Re/code. \u201cFreeBee Data 360 is an open, non-exclusive service available to other content providers on a non-discriminatory basis. Any interested content provider can use FreeBee Data 360 to expand their audiences by giving consumers the opportunity to enjoy their content without incurring data charges.\u201d>But here\u2019s the problem with that. Verizon runs the network. If a little bit of data traffic isn\u2019t getting paid for, it can just make sure its costs are covered by all the traffic that is paid.

It's only been in recent years that the idea of the oceans absorbing CO2 has been seriously taken into account, for example.

You'd be doing us other snowniggers a favour.Anyway, nice cherrypicking and missing the point of the article.For those here who don't speak Norwegian, I'll clear things up.First of all, our lovely OP makes it sound like the article's headline is \"White men between 40 and 50 years old is the problem\", and then goes on to mutter something about killing journalists. The actual headline is: \"Headhunter about the CEOs: \u2013 White, ethnically Norwegian male in his 40s-50s\". In other words, this is actually an interview, and the headline is a quote by the person that's interviewed.Then, I'll have to say what the article is actually about. It's not, as most of you seem to think, about white men being the issue when it comes to social progress. It's in fact a interview piece with a professional headhunter focusing on the fact that the vast majority of CEOs in state owned companies are white males of this age group. This is in relation to larger discussion that's going on in Norway right now. Furthermore, the headhunter in question says that it isn't only a matter of ethnicity or gender, but also age. The fact that the leadership in these companies are built of almost only one group that recruits only people like themselves is according to the headhunter a problem, for example stating that she thinks it keeps resourceful people that are of another ethnicity, female, too young, or too old out of these companies, thus weakening them.You might still have issue about the contents of the interview, but at least I'm being honest about the contents. Anyway, I guess it's time that you start calling me a liberal or whatever, It's to /pol/ way.

Second off, Men are more capable in stressful positions like managers and CEOs where big and harsh decisions are needed.

", " >>15399You migth want to reread my post, m8. As I said, the article doesn't talk about social progress, or anything like that. It's strictly directed towards the debate surrounding leadership culture in state owned companies.OP is just very blatantly trying to pass it off as being something that it isn't. If you want to discuss this subject, then that's fine, but be aware that you're not talking about the same thing that the original article is.Following that (and I won't go at lenght, as I have no desire to discuss these matters at 3 AM, especially as I just wanted to call OP out on his deception) I can't see any logic in your argument. Is it not negative for a meritocratic system to keep some people outside for reasons not related to their actual skills? You do, for example say that age has nothing to do with it. Does this mean that you think people in their 30s shouldn't be included into the leadership of these companies?>She is more racist, sexist, and ageist than a Nazi.This is completely nonsensical.The headhunter in question is interviewed about the situation, gives her description of it, and explains why she thinks this is hurting the companies. Somehow that's worse than Nazism. She doesn't even call out for any specific, drastic measures, except expecting that these companies follow the guidelines they'll eventually be given by the state.To put it another way, you do not know what you're talking about.

In america, there is very much a focus on segregation of cultural communities based on race, and it's largely self imposed.

In a country of hundreds of millions, there are bound to be a few people who need care, but don't have anyone to take care of them. But another important component of homelessness is people who are only temporarily (or so they hope...) homeless: people who are between jobs and trying to get back on their feet, people who escaped abusive partners or families but had nowhere else to go, people whose lives collapsed when they couldn't make a payment on something. These people can (and ought to be) helped by an entirely different set of support structures than what the stereotypical profoundly mentally ill or disabled \"street person\" needs. Too often we just look at homelessness as a number: \"How can we reduce this statistic for our community?\" is the only concern.

There is no distinction in the statue for \"accidental\" mishandling of classified information, rather the specific term \"gross negligence\", is used, and as the head of the state department is responsible for knowing what is and is not secret, transference of said information unsecured is the definition of gross negligence.The defense of Hillary being ignorant, unaware, or unknowledgable, is a direct violation of her position and duties as the head of the state department, and ignorance of the law is not a defense against the law in any way, shape or form.>Clinton's Use Of A Personal Email Account Was Legal And Did Not Violate State Department PolicyThe destruction of, and denial of the existence of, 30,000 of her emails, which contained 1,300+ classified and secret information, is not only a violation of the espionage act, but the willful destruction of government property, and is a federal crime.Stop trying to dump bullshit and eat a bullet.

All of them can classify something at any point that it gets spread around the chain of intelligence.The Benghazi Committee knows that the classified parts of the testimony, including the parts about Hillary's emails, exonerate her, which is why they haven't and won't ever release the testimony and won't call real witnesses.
