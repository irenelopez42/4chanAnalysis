But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians\u2019 role.>The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump\u2019s associates conspired.>If Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness, was the improbable match that set off a blaze that has consumed the first year of the Trump administration, his saga is also a tale of the Trump campaign in miniature. He was brash, boastful and underqualified, yet he exceeded expectations. And, like the campaign itself, he proved to be a tantalizing target for a Russian influence operation. "}, "replies": [" >>213104>While some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have derided him as an insignificant campaign volunteer or a \u201ccoffee boy,\u201d interviews and new documents show that he stayed influential throughout the campaign. Two months before the election, for instance, he helped arrange a New York meeting between Mr. Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.>The information that Mr. Papadopoulos gave to the Australians answers one of the lingering mysteries of the past year: What so alarmed American officials to provoke the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign months before the presidential election?>It was not, as Mr. Trump and other politicians have alleged, a dossier compiled by a former British spy hired by a rival campaign. Instead, it was firsthand information from one of America\u2019s closest intelligence allies.>Interviews and previously undisclosed documents show that Mr. Papadopoulos played a critical role in this drama and reveal a Russian operation that was more aggressive and widespread than previously known. They add to an emerging portrait, gradually filled in over the past year in revelations by federal investigators, journalists and lawmakers, of Russians with government contacts trying to establish secret channels at various levels of the Trump campaign.>The F.B.I. investigation, which was taken over seven months ago by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has cast a shadow over Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office \u2014 even as he and his aides repeatedly played down the Russian efforts and falsely denied campaign contacts with Russians.>They have also insisted that Mr. Papadopoulos was a low-level figure. But spies frequently target peripheral players as a way to gain insight and leverage. ", " >>213105>F.B.I. officials disagreed in 2016 about how aggressively and publicly to pursue the Russia inquiry before the election. But there was little debate about what seemed to be afoot. John O. Brennan, who retired this year after four years as C.I.A. director, told Congress in May that he had been concerned about multiple contacts between Russian officials and Trump advisers.>Russia, he said, had tried to \u201csuborn\u201d members of the Trump campaign.>\u2018The Signal to Meet\u2019>Mr. Papadopoulos, then an ambitious 28-year-old from Chicago, was working as an energy consultant in London when the Trump campaign, desperate to create a foreign policy team, named him as an adviser in early March 2016. His political experience was limited to two months on Ben Carson\u2019s presidential campaign before it collapsed.>Mr. Papadopoulos had no experience on Russia issues. But during his job interview with Sam Clovis, a top early campaign aide, he saw an opening. He was told that improving relations with Russia was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top foreign policy goals, according to court papers, an account Mr. Clovis has denied. ", " >>213107>Traveling in Italy that March, Mr. Papadopoulos met Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor at a now-defunct London academy who had valuable contacts with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Mifsud showed little interest in Mr. Papadopoulos at first.>But when he found out he was a Trump campaign adviser, he latched onto him, according to court records and emails obtained by The New York Times. Their joint goal was to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow, or between their respective aides.>In response to questions, Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s lawyers declined to provide a statement.>Before the end of the month, Mr. Mifsud had arranged a meeting at a London cafe between Mr. Papadopoulos and Olga Polonskaya, a young woman from St. Petersburg whom he falsely described as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece. Although Ms. Polonskaya told The Times in a text message that her English skills are poor, her emails to Mr. Papadopoulos were largely fluent. \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d Ms. Polonskaya wrote in one message.>More important, Mr. Mifsud connected Mr. Papadopoulos to Ivan Timofeev, a program director for the prestigious Valdai Discussion Club, a gathering of academics that meets annually with Mr. Putin. The two men corresponded for months about how to connect the Russian government and the campaign. Records suggest that Mr. Timofeev, who has been described by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team as an intermediary for the Russian Foreign Ministry, discussed the matter with the ministry\u2019s former leader, Igor S. Ivanov, who is widely viewed in the United States as one of Russia\u2019s elder statesmen. ", " >>213126>Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, initially did not reveal that discussion to Congress, because, he has said, he did not recall it. More recently, he said he pushed back against Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s proposal, at least partly because he did not want someone so unqualified to represent the campaign on such a sensitive matter.>If the campaign wanted Mr. Papadopoulos to stand down, previously undisclosed emails obtained by The Times show that he either did not get the message or failed to heed it. He continued for months to try to arrange some kind of meeting with Russian representatives, keeping senior campaign advisers abreast of his efforts. Mr. Clovis ultimately encouraged him and another foreign policy adviser to travel to Moscow, but neither went because the campaign would not cover the cost.>Mr. Papadopoulos was trusted enough to edit the outline of Mr. Trump\u2019s first major foreign policy speech on April 27, an address in which the candidate said it was possible to improve relations with Russia. Mr. Papadopoulos flagged the speech to his newfound Russia contacts, telling Mr. Timofeev that it should be taken as \u201cthe signal to meet.\u201d>\u201cThat is a statesman speech,\u201d Mr. Mifsud agreed. Ms. Polonskaya wrote that she was pleased that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cposition toward Russia is much softer\u201d than that of other candidates.>Stephen Miller, then a senior policy adviser to the campaign and now a top White House aide, was eager for Mr. Papadopoulos to serve as a surrogate, someone who could publicize Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy views without officially speaking for the campaign. But Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s first public attempt to do so was a disaster. ", " >>213127>In a May 4, 2016, interview with The Times of London, Mr. Papadopoulos called on Prime Minister David Cameron to apologize to Mr. Trump for criticizing his remarks on Muslims as \u201cstupid\u201d and divisive. \u201cSay sorry to Trump or risk special relationship, Cameron told,\u201d the headline read. Mr. Clovis, the national campaign co-chairman, severely reprimanded Mr. Papadopoulos for failing to clear his explosive comments with the campaign in advance.>From then on, Mr. Papadopoulos was more careful with the press \u2014 though he never regained the full trust of Mr. Clovis or several other campaign officials.>Mr. Mifsud proposed to Mr. Papadopoulos that he, too, serve as a campaign surrogate. He could write op-eds under the guise of a \u201cneutral\u201d observer, he wrote in a previously undisclosed email, and follow Mr. Trump to his rallies as an accredited journalist while receiving briefings from the inside the campaign.>In late April, at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just learned from high-level Russian officials in Moscow that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails,\u201d according to court documents. Although Russian hackers had been mining data from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers for months, that information was not yet public. Even the committee itself did not know. ", " >>213128>Whether Mr. Papadopoulos shared that information with anyone else in the campaign is one of many unanswered questions. He was mostly in contact with the campaign over emails. The day after Mr. Mifsud\u2019s revelation about the hacked emails, he told Mr. Miller in an email only that he had \u201cinteresting messages coming in from Moscow\u201d about a possible trip. The emails obtained by The Times show no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos discussed the stolen messages with the campaign.>Not long after, however, he opened up to Mr. Downer, the Australian diplomat, about his contacts with the Russians. It is unclear whether Mr. Downer was fishing for that information that night in May 2016. The meeting at the bar came about because of a series of connections, beginning with an Israeli Embassy official who introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to another Australian diplomat in London.>It is also not clear why, after getting the information in May, the Australian government waited two months to pass it to the F.B.I. In a statement, the Australian Embassy in Washington declined to provide details about the meeting or confirm that it occurred.>\u201cAs a matter of principle and practice, the Australian government does not comment on matters relevant to active investigations,\u201d the statement said. The F.B.I. declined to comment. ", " TLDR: Papadopolous is a Russian shill, and Trump can't deny the role that he played in the campaign. He found out about the hacked DNC emails well before they were leaked to the public, and sent a suggestive email to Stephen Miller about them. We don't know for certain \"what the President knew and when he knew it,\" but it doesn't look good for Trump. Papadopolous got drunk with an Australian official, and told him about the emails. The Australians then turned around and informed the FBI, which prompted the start of the Russian investigation. We don't know all of the details yet concerning what exactly Papadopolous told the Australians, and how much that Papadopolous knows. But considering that he has been flipped like Mueller, I imagine the truth will see the light of day sooner than later. Nothingburger arguments defending Trump's employment of a Russian tool commence in 3...2...1...

Phony and non-existent \u201csources\u201d are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction! ", " >>213131At least Trump will be glad that we all know it wasn't the piss tape dossier that got the ball rolling after all. ", " >>213162Having someone run their mouth while drunk is almost worse though. If there actually was a pissing incident, at least he would have presumably enjoyed it. If Papadopolous got drunk enough to say something that stupid, he probably had one hell of a hangover.This might explain why he got so pissy with the Australian PM though.Official thread theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s ", " >>213104Too fucking right m8. I tried it many times and it didn't end well. ", " We knew this already, though. Accusations the Trump campaign knew about the DNC leaks before the press were swirling around from July 22nd 2016 onward. In fairness to the Australian who sat on this for two months, i must reveal what might be a shocking revelation for some: Hillary Clinton is not a human being but rather a series of scandals attached together with bits of yarn housed in a exopantsuit of DARPA design.Papadopoulos really wanted to be the fucking man. He reached out to every one he could, acting as a nexus of gossip. Trump likes to surround himself with this kind of frenetic ambition. He let's these guys run wild so long as they don't go too far off the reservation or deign to speak for him. Running around the world leaving calling cards that will get you in contact with Trump was his job. So, yeah, he's a covfefe boy for sure. While generating contacts with Russians he hears about the leaks and then tries to impress an Australian diplomat at a bar with how he's got this hot Russian contact with dirt on C-dog so as to make even greater inroads. Not long after poor 28 year old Papadopoulos' big mouth brings him to the attention Of the FBI, and they sweat him for a few. They ask the big question that's been in the news: ", " \"Ever talk to a Russian bout emails, boy?\" He probably turned whiter than any Greek had been since before the Ottoman Empire. The access he had, the connections he made, and all the other shit that made him the fucking man were jeopardized. Regardless of what he did, whether or not anything he did was illegal, even if he said Russia and email in the same sentence it looked bad for him and Trump. He lied like a child, and the lie itself is the crime they used to tear open his life like a can of spam.Not that different from how they got Flynn, really. But to turn around and call them Russian shills is pretty lame. Flynn and Papadopoulos are lobbyists, and if what lobbyists disgusts you then you better never go to DC. The only illegal act this article confirmed was that he lied to the FBI. What remains to be seen is if there is any concrete wrong doing beyond catching aides pulling a Martha Stewart. ", " >>213208>>213209>damage control - the postsFuck off Vlad. ", " >>213212No u ", " >>213214>Not that different from how they got FlynnMate, really? ", " >>213216Yes, really. Michael Flynn did nothing wrong when he lobbied the Russians to delay a vote at the UN during the transition. He did nothing wrong when he asked the Russian ambassador to try to get the Russians wait on a response to sanctions placed on Russia. He's a lobbyist, that's his job. He fucked up when he lied to the FBI about it. ", " >>213221>He fucked up when he lied to the FBI about it.Was that how this Aussie caught out your boy George?No George started lying much later.And why did Flynn lie if nothing he did was wrong?Like I said; Damage control. ", " >>213223Yeah, it was their attempt at damage control. Whats your disagreement? ", " >>213232>Whats your disagreement?Mate, really? ", " >>213233I've already gone, its your turn. ", " >>213234>Mate, really?That was a hint. I don't enjoy repeating myself.Tell us again how George getting drunk spilling his guts to an Aussie is just like Flynn cracking under FBI interrogation. ", " >>213235It's the same in that bragging that you know a guy who knows a Russian with dirt on a political opponent isn't illegal in the same way as asking the Russians to not vote against Israel at the UN or overreact to Obama's eleventh hour sanctions isn't illegal but lying to the FBI is. They committed perjury because they were fearful of the media reaction to speaking with people with sensitive information and influence. But sensitive information and influence are the things lobbyists are paid to peddle.I'll explain it again differently:Things they lied about are similar because they were legal acts done for the same employer and vocation. Not just worried about losing status in circles of influence, they risked losing Trumps confidence. Neither of them wanted to give anyone a reason to drag them through the Russiagate circus. As a result of their fears they perjured themselves to the FBI.Are they not the same in all these ways? Is being a gossipy drunk at a bar illegal in England? ", " >>213239>Are they not the same in all these ways?You seem stretching for similarities where there are more differences.Any serious ideas why they lied if they did nothing wrong? Being scared of the media reaction is clearly bullshit when it was the FBI they lied to and not the media.Also I think some of this \"lobbying\" activity was actually illegal. ", " >>213242 I wish lobbyists couldn't do a lot of things but setting up independent communication channels is an important task for any new administration. Also, if looking into foreigners with information on your political opponent is illegal then both candidates would have still not been convicted because Comey was a man paid to be professionally incompetent.I would say that their lives revolve around their ability to make friends and schmooze. The both of them seem to be huge socialites, real people persons. Day to day they move in circles filled with diplomats and other lobbyists who are already not big fans of Trump since his campaign painted their professions as being part of a swamp needing to be drained. The prospect of having the FBI release or leak a deposition that a grinning media would use to hang a sandwich board over them reading \"Russian Stooge\" in a thousand click bait articles. They wouldn't be able to do their job jetting around the world drinking and flirting with other men. Imagine the horror of a young Greek man at losing that sweet deal. ", " >>213209>>213208What you leave out is that he was close enough with the Russians to know that they had stolen emails from the DNC. According to Merriam-Webster, collusion means:secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purposeAgreement: But when (Mifsud) found out (Papadopolous) was a Trump campaign adviser, he latched onto him, according to court records and emails obtained by The New York Times. Their joint goal was to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V.

Even the committee itself did not know.Thank God for cognitive dissonance, otherwise we'd have to accept evidence that counters our world-views. ", " >>213239>being gossipy drunk at a bar illegalNo, but what you're defending is a member of the Trump administration who very well knew that the Russians were engaging in espionage and cyber-attacks, with the clear purpose of swaying a democratic election. Collusion isn't illegal either, but Trumpites have been denying it since day 1 because they knew it was pretty damning. I like how Trump has shifted the goalpost to \"collusion totally didn't happen... but if it did it's fine because it's not illegal.\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/366746-trump-even-if-there-was-collusion-with-russia-its-not-a-crimeWe have a smoking gun for collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russians. The question now is what did Trump know, and when did he know it? ", " >>213330Except that's not what got him in trouble, and that's a more important detail. The joke here is that he could have told the FBI everything you listed and they would have had nothing to charge him with. His relationships with Mr. Mifsud, Ms. Polonskaya and Mr. Timofeev as described didn't include any illegal acts. Calling their conversations and networking collusion is a misuse of that word in the context you mean it in.But let's throw in a quote from outside the article.https://youtu.be/HwXGLNgH69A>Russia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.This was said to a crowd, never apologized for, and then repeated throughout the remainder Trump's campaign to continued applause from his base. He's not in jail for it because Trump knows better than to perjure himself. And even if you triangulate this comment with the actions of Papadopoulos and Flynn you still don't have evidence of collusion.>>213335Neither the revalation that Russia is engaging in espionage or that its government wouldn't want to see a Clinton in office was news to anyone.>collusion totally didn't happen... but if it did it's fine because it's not illegal.This has been the official response as far as I can tell since Trump made that statement on July 27th 2016. Unless the FBI knows something that the New York Times doesn't, there isn't anything here to impeach with. ", " sounds like this guy was just claiming he had emails. Probably trying to bait donors. Really easy claim when actual WikiLeaks were released at the time. Also the Benghazi committee's email work had been happening publicly for 1+ year.Garbage journalism here ", " >>213104>The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump\u2019s associates conspired.This is NOT a basis for violating the due process rights of the campaign members.

She told the officers two black men in hoodies, who she previously saw running from the crime scene, were on Hering Ave.The officers drove down the block, spotted Onilude in a hoodie walking in the opposite direction, and took him into custody. But they later testified they never brought Onilude back to Lounds to check if he was the person she had seen.During questioning in the precinct, Onilude said he was with his girlfriend the day of the stabbing. He acknowledged being at the scene after the driver was attacked \u2014 but he strenuously denied being involved in the crime. The questioning lasted 18 hours in a small room, where Onilude was cuffed to a vent.Chico later told Onilude the victim identified him from a photo lineup displayed at his hospital bedside. But in court, Onilude\u2019s lawyers argued the detective never got that identification, noting there was no written record of it. In fact, there are no pages left in Chico\u2019s memo book after Onilude\u2019s arrest.http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/city-pay-man-2-4m-settlement-wrongful-stabbing-arrest-article-1.3714350 "}, "replies": [" these are hard cases indeedbecause you know niggers gonna nig but also it may just be true in this case that the poor nigger indeed did not stab anyone ", " bootlickers gonna say cops dindu nuffin ", " >>211963Cops dindu nuffin ", " >Cuffed to a vent for 18 hoursAre interrogation rooms really not equipped with anything better than a vent to cuff niggers to?

He, however, did not turn down the prosecution's request. The prosecutor who ordered this \"production\" of evidence was Claiborne Richardson. Unfortunately, he has the sort of immunity cops like Abbott can only wish they had: absolute immunity. Richardson walks away from this with little more than reputational damage.cont. "}, "replies": [" >>205270There's a judge out there somewhere with their name scrawled across a granted warrant request ordering a teenager to produce an erection for cops. Actually, there's two of them, though both go unnamed in the decision [PDF]. (Oral arguments are embedded at the bottom of the post.) From the dissent's[!] footnote:\u201cOn this record, search warrants were issued on June 3, 2014, and again on July 1, 2014, by two different magistrates. See Supp. J.A. 72, 76. The June warrant was the only one executed. In executing the June warrant, Abbott was unable to obtain some of the photos being sought. Because the prosecutor and the detective agreed that additional photos were necessary, Abbott was directed to seek the July warrant. That warrant was never executed and was voided.\u201dAnd there's the judge who heard the prosecution's request to get this warrant and said that was fine. That judge's name is Jan Roltsch-Anoll. All of these justice system components worked together to put a teen in a room full of cops with the instructions to masturbate so a detective could take photos.Abbott's representation was willing to take a chance on seeing the lower court's awful immunity decision upheld, despite there being nothing remotely sane -- much less Fourth Amendment-compliant -- about law enforcement's actions. Detective Abbott's survivors continue his fight for him as Abbott killed himself in late 2015 as police tried to arrest him for allegedly molesting two teens he met coaching youth hockey. (Make of that what you will.)The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals finds nothing at all to like about Abbott's pleas for qualified immunity.cont. ", " >>205271\u201cAbbott\u2019s search directed at forcing Sims to achieve an erection intruded \u201cupon an area in which our society recognizes a significantly heightened privacy interest.\u201d See Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 767 (1985). Requiring Sims to masturbate in the presence of others, like searches involving physical penetration of genitalia, constituted \u201cthe ultimate invasion of personal dignity.\u201d Amaechi, 237 F.3d at 363-64; see also King, 825 F.3d at 215.Moreover, we observe that this sexually intrusive search was rendered more egregious by being conducted in a manner that would instill fear in Sims. See Edwards, 666 F.3d at 884-85. Here, Sims alleged that he was \u201csurrounded\u201d by three armed officers as he questioned whether he was required to submit to Abbott\u2019s orders. Upon Abbott\u2019s insistence, Sims ultimately attempted to comply. Sims further alleged that the search caused him to suffer emotional harm. Winston, 470 U.S. at 761-63 (explaining that intrusions without risk of physical harm nonetheless damage the individual\u2019s sense of personal privacy and security). Accordingly, both the outrageous scope of the sexually intrusive search and the intimidating manner in which the search was conducted weigh strongly against any finding that the search was reasonable.We cannot perceive any circumstance that would justify a police search requiring an individual to masturbate in the presence of others.\u201dcont. ", " >>205273Abbott's estate argued the search violated no clear precedent. In other words, no comparative case had reached this level in the justice system and found ordering a teen to masturbate in front of police officers (while one of them photographed him) was a clearly established violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court agrees, but notes there's a very good goddamn reason why there's no precedent exactly on point with this abysmal abuse of power.\u201cWe further observe that the Administrator is not entitled to invoke qualified immunity simply because no other court decisions directly have addressed circumstances like those presented here. See Clem, 284 F.3d at 553. For good reason, most outrageous cases of constitutional violations rarely are litigated. See K.H. ex rel. Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F.2d 846, 851 (7th Cir. 1990) (explaining that never before had there been a case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery, but those officials nevertheless would not be entitled to immunity). Abbott\u2019s conduct affronted the basic protections of the Fourth Amendment, which at its core protects personal privacy and dignity against unjustified intrusion by governmental actors.\u201dThe dissent actually believes Abbott should still be granted immunity because a) he obtained warrants and b) he consulted with Commonwealth prosecutors (namely, Claiborne Richardson, whose reputation should be just as worthless as Abbott's) before obtaining them. If we follow this line of thinking, we are being asked to absolve all officers of egregious misconduct so long as certain procedural steps are followed before they go off the deep end. In fact, it asks to reward officers (and other government employees) who can find support from equally-questionable colleagues for their actions. According to the dissent, the whole rotten barrel should be excused from punishment because the rot was caused by several bad apples, rather than a single, rogue actor.cont. ", " >>205274Even worse, if you're going to choose a qualified immunity hill to die on, why would you choose the one containing cops and prosecutors taking photographs of a masturbating teen? What possible public service could a decision in the detective's favor possibly provide? All it would do is create one more line an Appeals Court has yet to draw, allowing cops to force minors to strip and masturbate as long as they have a warrant. But that's what Judge Robert B. King apparently wants: no precedential declaration that forcing minors to masturbate in the presence of officers is a clear violation of established rights. But that's the way the system works. It so insulates police officers and prosecutors from accountability, no one at the bottom level of this pathetic prosecutorial food chain took any action to stop this from happening until after two warrants were issued and one was executed.True fact: people in these positions can stop at any time. They don't need to wait for clearly-established precedent from high-level federal courts. No one forces prosecutors to suggest taking photos of a teen's erect penis and insane requests from prosecutors can always be turned down by law enforcement officers. But no one did anything to head off the clear rights violation. And once it was done, Detective Abbott tried to Nuremberg his way out of it and the Commonwealth's attorney -- Claiborne Richardson -- ducked out of the public eye as soon as the shit started hitting the fan. The legacy of everyone involved, from the detective executing the warrant to the juvenile court judge who granted time for it to be executed should be tarnished forever.FIN ", " If he achieved an erection while several cops surrounded and acted menacingly towards him, color me impressed.Also, what the fuck?

Across-model relationships between currently observable attributes of the climate system and the simulated magnitude of future warming have the potential to inform projections. Here we show that robust across-model relationships exist between the global spatial patterns of several fundamental attributes of Earth\u2019s top-of-atmosphere energy budget and the magnitude of projected global warming. When we constrain the model projections with observations, we obtain greater means and narrower ranges of future global warming across the major radiative forcing scenarios, in general. In particular, we find that the observationally informed warming projection for the end of the twenty-first century for the steepest radiative forcing scenario is about 15 per cent warmer (+0.5 degrees Celsius) with a reduction of about a third in the two-standard-deviation spread (\u22121.2 degrees Celsius) relative to the raw model projections reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our results suggest that achieving any given global temperature stabilization target will require steeper greenhouse gas emissions reductions than previously calculated.

Nobody else would be sufficiently rich and determined to fill universities across the entire planet will such deliberate falsehoods as that carbon and methane cause the greenhouse effect. I mean, the lies are so deeply embedded that they even claim Venus is hotter than Mercury because of its carbon rich atmosphere and resulting greenhouse effect. Their end-goal is clear; the total downfall of Western Civilization. After all, investments in clean energy such as nuclear and solar will inevitably cause the economy to collapse, giving niggers free reign to rape millions of white women.

I'm sure the resulting discussion of subsequent posted responses that are on track will help all of us to come to appreciate others' viewpoints, and allow us to form more educated opinions. ", " >>210753I agree with some of what you say, and disagree with others.For starters, you have been misinformed about Mercury and Venus, but not for reasons you may think. It has nothing to do with proving or disproving \"global warming\" Venus has a very thick and dense atmosphere, whereas Mercury has none. In the case of Mercury, it's surface temperature is hotter on one side of the planet than Venus is due to its sheer proximity to the Sun, but it has no capability of trapping that heat in an atmosphere because it is non-existent or nearly nonexistent. Venus does have an atmosphere with a genuine runaway greenhouse effect, but that does nothing to prove or disprove a runaway effect here on Earth. Climate science is legitimate science as is every other science, but admittedly it is still in its infancy. We already know it can happen here because of fossilized plants that reveal pores for diffusing atmospheric gasses which were much larger than plants have today, and also fossilized animals with bodies that could only be supported by cardiovascular systems that were adapted to an atmosphere with a similarly enhanced greenhouse effect.These things are really quite indisputable, however their implications for our future ARE disputable as you correctly point out. Our atmosphere clearly goes through greenhouse cycles, and we already know that these cycles do not destroy life on Earth, but instead the opposite. In fact, it seems to periodically jumpstart new cycles of evolutionary diversification not destroy it. But that is not the same as anyone claiming today that our greenhouse cycle has the capability of wiping out the Human Race.Does a greenhouse effect have the ability to force us to continue evolving and adapting further? Sure, of course it does, why not? But to make us go extinct? Maybe, maybe not. But it's absolutely unproven that it could wipe us out, climate science is too new to be certain about this.I agree with you about Soros, more in my next post. ", " >>210763I believe that recent records from the last few decades show that the Club of Rome and other lefty NGOs and thinktanks prove that climate paranoia is really about subjugating governments by regulating their economies in a way meant to bring about eventual global government. Soros and his kind are clearly reading off the same sheet of music, and the Lefty plan is to bring about global governance by 1% elites through a process of \"embracing\" different nationalities and merging them for governance under the same umbrella.In truth, Right extremists also desire global domination, just through different means and with slightly different aims. Their goal is to ignore climate *disruption* long enough that it easily in decreased good supplies, this causing the Earth to be able to sustain fewer people and usher in a social and political revolution that suits the goals of the Right while wiping out the Left and their constituent populations.Climate change is different than \"global warming\" even if the Earth does warm by a slight amount. It requires life to continue adapting and evolving as it always yas, but it doesn't necessarily resul in the extinction of the Human race. That's just Lefty fear-based agitprop.The truth is, we all know that Global Government of some kind is inevitable. Most people really arent stupid enough to believe otherwise. Whats disputable is whos gunna win this social war, and what means are adopted to achieve victory by the winning side. It will require truth, lies, propaganda, science and bullshit of every kind no matter who it is that wins the war.It will result in a massive loss of life, where it's by climate or not.We are destined to outlast the Earth itself which means we are destined to face probable extinction a number of times by various means. I have no doubt that climate will be involved. But will it be the specific cause one way or the other? Of course not, at least not for a long time. Will read yours next.

I'd rather not concede that a massive global war of consolidation is inevitable. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and I simply don't believe there is a war going on behind the curtains between nefarious left-wing puppet masters and nefarious right-wing puppet masters. I think they're operating in the daylight, throwing their money around as they please to support their political viewpoints. Nobody questions that the Koch brothers think climate denialism will result in more industry-friendly policies that will benefit them, and that Soros feels the opposite. I'd simply rather see my tax dollars pumped into research that will help effectively slow or even stop the climate change that will result in a loss of land to the sea, dying ecosystems (they will eventually adapt, but it doesn't happen in a lifetime), massive migrations, spreading diseases, and droughts.

Anything to the contrary is political propaganda, and you know it.What there IS a broader scientific consensus about are ongoing survival issues like topsoil depletion, deforestation, ocean acidification and nuclear war, to name several commonly recognized by the layman.

Clickbait is clickbait and falsefagging is falsefagging, regardless of his claimed reasons.I've singlehandedly put more effort into acknowledging climate change than anyone in the thread, including you, so spare me your preaching bullshit.Climate change is real, political propaganda is 90% of its discussion, and a trolling clickbaiter who believes in it is still a fucking faggot who should be slapped for trying to hijack the debate to stroke his own ego.I bet dollars to donuts that I know and remember more about this topic without using google than all of you put together, so quit feeding the trolls and add something relevant, or find something else to preach about.Thanks.

Chinese Beggars Are Now Accepting Mobile Payments", "comment": " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QChUMt57RcIf you still have any doubts that mobile devices have taken over our lives, this should make you a firm believer: smartphones and QR codes have become tools of the trade for Chinese beggars. If you\u2019re feeling generous, you can simply whip out your phone, scan a a printed QR code and transfer some money to the beggar\u2019s account.Local media have spread news of mobile-savvy beggars in the city of Jinan, in China\u2019s Shandong province. They gather in areas popular with tourists, holding begging bowls that contain a QR code printout. Anyone with Alipay, WeChat Wallet, or some other mobile payment app can scan the code and make a donation. Wait, beggars in China have mobile phones? Well, according to state media outlets, that\u2019s not actually a rare thing.One of the beggars who caught the media\u2019s attention was reportedly a man with mental problems and the QR code he had was made by his family to help him. However, it appears that QR code begging serves other purposes besides generating income for people down on their luck. According to digital marketing company China Channel, many beggars in Beijing receive payment from local businesses for every QR code scanned by passers-by. The enterprises use these scans to collect people\u2019s data from WeChat profiles, then sell the IDs for quite a pretty penny to small businesses. The latter use the information to bombard the users with unsolicited in-app advertisements.http://www.odditycentral.com/news/no-loose-change-chinese-beggars-are-now-accepting-mobile-payments.html "}, "replies": [" Since passers-by don\u2019t actually have to give any money, they are not all that difficult to persuade. However, the \u201cbeggars\u201d get paid for their efforts: each QR code scan pays between 0.7 and 1.5 yuan ($0.10 to $0.22). A 45-hour working week nets a monthly average of 4,536 yuan ($685), which is quite decent given what Chinese workers in minimum wage jobs get.The whole thing may sound weird to foreigners, but it must be noted that China is perhaps the country closest to a cashless economy and QR codes are the reason for that. The black-and-white, two-dimensional barcodes are used in all sorts of ways: from payment in shops to tips in restaurants and cash gifts at weddings. In fact, mobile payments in China exceed 50 times the volume for the US, where the 2016 tally was $112 billion.According to consumer behavior researcher Chen Yiwen, China is on the verge of a\u201ccodeconomy.\u201d\u201cChina has started the transition to a cash-free economy faster than anyone could have imagined, largely because of the viral spread of two-dimensional barcode. It creates a new economy based on scannable codes.\u201dInterestingly, Western beggars are not that far behind their Chinese peers, when it comes to mobile payments.

On Wednesday, he will be arguing to the United States Supreme Court that the privacy of historical location data collected by cell towers should be protected by the Constitution. If the justices agree, it will be the first time the Constitution\u2019s privacy protections have been updated since the internet was invented. As digital technology becomes increasingly necessary for day-to-day activities, the outcome of this case could help determine how private those activities are.\u201cFor every advance in technology, the [high] court has had an opportunity to weigh in on the effect of the new technology on privacy,\u201d says Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThis case may very well decide whether we can expect privacy in the digital age.\u201dBefore he was a pioneer of privacy rights, Carpenter was supplying the firearms and serving as a lookout for robberies. During that spree seven years ago, his fellow robbers would enter a store brandishing their guns, herd customers and employees to the back, and order them to fill bags with new smartphones.While investigating the robberies, authorities ordered MetroPCS and Sprint to turn over records of every call made to and from Carpenter\u2019s phone over a 127-day period from cell sites the two companies operated in the areas where robberies were alleged to have occurred. The records \u2013 obtained in accordance with a federal law but without a judge-approved warrant \u2013 helped authorities place Carpenter at the scenes of the robberies and, ultimately, convict him.... "}, "replies": [" Carpenter, however, has argued that if the government wants to know something as sensitive as his specific location at a certain time, it should have to abide by the Fourth Amendment and show a judge probable cause that he was involved in criminal activity first.Lower courts have disagreed with Carpenter, but the high court, after nibbling at the edges of the issue in recent years, will now confront it head-on.Pre-internet privacy lawsThe Fourth Amendment is one of the Constitution\u2019s blunter legal instruments, and thus the justices have agreed to periodically update it throughout history to reflect technological advances. The amendment originally required a warrant only for searches of \u201chouses, papers and effects,\u201d but it was expanded in the 19th century to include contents of letters carried by the postal system. In the 1970s, it was expanded to include telephone conversations, and it has not been updated since.Significantly, throughout all these changes the content of communications has been protected by the Constitution, but information about communications (or \u201cnon-content\u201d) have not. The Supreme Court maintained that precedent in its last major Fourth Amendment decision, the 1979 case Smith v. Maryland that created what is known as the \u201cthird-party doctrine.\u201d The court ruled then that a person \"has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties\" \u2013 in this case a pen register, created by the telephone company at the request of police, of all numbers dialed by an alleged robber.That kind of \u201cnon-content\u201d information now includes the metadata \u2013 the data about data \u2013 transmitted constantly by digital technologies such as smartphones.

", " It is the latest move by the national Evangelical Lutheran church to modernise its 31-year-old handbook setting out how services should be conducted.The decision to update the book of worship gives priests new options on how to refer to God during their services. Priests can now open their services by referring to the traditional \"Father, son and Holy Ghost\" or the gender-neutral phrase \"in the name of God and the Holy Trinity\". Other gender-neutral options are available for other parts of the Church of Sweden liturgy.\"We talk about Jesus Christ, but in a few places we have changed it to say 'God' instead of 'he',\" Church of Sweden spokesperson Sofija Pedersen Videke told The Telegraph. \"We have some prayer options that are more gender-neutral than others.\"\"A wide majority of people decided on the book,\" she said, adding that she had heard of no priests who objected to the new linguistic framework.The Church of Sweden is headed by Archbishop Antje Jackelen, who was elected Sweden's first female archbishop in 2013.Archbishop Jackelen defended the decision, telling Sweden's TT news agency: \"Theologically, for instance, we know that God is beyond our gender determinations, God is not human.\" The decision was met with some criticism. Christer Pahlmblad, an associate theology professor at Lund University in Sweden, told Danish newspaper Kristeligt Dagblad that the decision was \"undermining the doctrine of the Trinity and the community with the other Christian churches.\"\"It really isn't smart if the Church of Sweden becomes known as a church that does not respect the common theology heritage,\" he said. The Church of Sweden has 6.1 million baptised members in a country with a population of 10 million. ", " The Church of England told The Telegraph that it also chooses to avoid divisive language in its services, but not with regards to God. \u201cWhen liturgy is revised we also seek to use inclusive language where appropriate when referring to people,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe Church of England has always used masculine language when speaking about God, for example in the words of the Lord\u2019s Prayer \u2013 \u2018our Father, who art in Heaven\u2019 \u2013 and in referring to God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and continues to do so.\"The decision by the Church of Sweden mirrors an international trend for inclusivity in major churches.

He also chose a Jewish guy named Jared Kushner as his SENIOR ADVISOR... who everyone knew had MARRIED TRUMPS DAUGHTER YEARS BEFORE HE RAN FOR OFFICE.Trumpfags are probably the second-stupidest class of hominids to ever have lived on planet Earth. ", " >>204622Right, but seeing as how we\u2019ve recognized Israel for 70 years, armed them, shared intelligence with them, championed them in the UN, and give them billions in ongoing military aid, we\u2019re pretty firmly on Team Israel and should back them against the useless Sunni sandpeople who have no potential to contribute to our world ", " >>204634Agree 100%10/10 ", " >>204634It's true that we're on Team Israel but it's also true that the USA has always pushed for negotiation and officially opposed unilateral actions (settlements, East Jerusalem) which alter the status quo and make future peace more difficult. Even if you take the position that the Palestinians are useless sand people it's in Israel's long term interest to achieve peace. The occupation undermines Israel's international support, fuels radical Islam, and erodes Israel's democracy and moral character. Instead of providing them with unconditional support we should pressure them to make hard compromises and achieve lasting peace. But Trump has no familiarity with any of what I just said, he is desperately looking for some foreign policy accomplishments. ", " >>204572>>204622>>204634Your missing the point. Heavily helping Israel while still supporting the peace process and not 'officially' taking a side allowed a lot of diplomatic soft power over both Palestine and Israel. We had something over them and could use to keep them both in check if we wanted. 'officially' taking a side with Israel and having supporting them no matter what is essentially the same as having your opinion no longer being relevant in Israels decisions. Because Israel doesn't really need US aid and they know it.If we really are willing to go to war to defend and support Israel, and we no longer have a real say over the peace talks, then Israel really does now dictate US policy in the region because of Trump. This combined with the sabre rattling with Iran basically means there is a very good chance that US troops are getting sent back into sand-land for another decade of cluster fucks.

Messenger Kids users can do many of the same things users of the regular Messenger app can do \u2014 send text-based messages, video chat, tack on virtual stickers and face masks \u2014 but with stricter rules and parental controls in place.>Setting up a Messenger Kids account for a child requires their parent to sign in at first with their Facebook accounts. Once the Messenger Kids account is set up, a child can only chat with people on the app their parents have approved. Both parents and kids can report inappropriate content and block other users; parents are notified from their standard Messenger apps when their kids report other users or if their kids are reported by others. Finally, users of Messenger Kids can\u2019t delete any messages they\u2019ve sent or received inside the app \u2014 another safeguard, in case parents want to check what their children have been up to.>Like any business, Facebook\u2019s goals shouldn\u2019t be viewed as entirely altruistic, even if Messenger Kids is free to download and use.

He assumed that someone else at the department called the service it uses for interpreters.\"I allowed her to do it. I didn't ask enough questions,\" Hegarty said. \"How she knew about the press conference and why she volunteered to do sign language interpretation is still a mystery Hegarty wants to solve.\"I don't know what motivates her, but she hasn't returned my calls,\" he said. \"I would like to know both professionally, and also personally, how did it occur to you to come down to do that?\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/interpreter-delivered-confusion-florida-news-conference-51559392 "}, "replies": [" At the next day's follow-up news conference, a different interpreter, Ben Zapata, was beside the chief.Hegarty said she won't face any charges.

A message left at a number listed for Roberts wasn't immediately returned.It is the most recent example of an apparently unqualified signer appearing at news conferences. In September, as Hurricane Irma approached Florida and officials announced a mandatory evacuation, an interpreter in nearby Manatee County began signing words like \"pizza,\" ''monster\" and \"bear,\" along with other gibberish.Manatee County officials later said they were in a pinch and called on a county employee who had an understanding of sign language because he communicates with his deaf brother. However, it quickly became apparent he was in over his head. The deaf community demanded an apology and the video of the news conference went viral.In 2013 in South Africa, a fake interpreter appeared beside former President Barak Obama and other world leaders during a memorial service for Nelson Mandela, apparently signing gibberish. He later said he is schizophrenic and had seen angels descending in the stadium where the event took place.Settambrino said Florida, unlike some other states, does not require ASL interpreters to be certified through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, a national nonprofit that \"seeks to uphold standards, ethics, and professionalism\" for the field, according to its website.Florida says only that ASL interpreters have to be \"qualified,\" Settambrino said. \"But what is that definition of qualified?\" ", " >try to sign in ebonics>get arrestedRACIS ", " >>203997>sign in ebonicsHAHAHAHAHAHAAA ", " >>203997>>204001simply epic, my dudeskekek ", " >>204047I'm so glad you saw this also, I'm spreading this shit please do the same with me : )))Still fucking LOLing "]}, "203745": {"op": {"timestamp": 1512342000, "title": "Getty scandal", "comment": " https://www.instagram.com/p/BZG19HTlRX9/?hl=enThis ivy Getty.

Previously, the US military carried out strikes only when facing imminent threat or working directly with Afghan forces.Nicholson, speaking Monday from Kabul to reporters at the Pentagon, said that the strikes \u2013 carried out by B-52 bombers, highly advanced F-22 Raptor fighters, unmanned aircraft and Marine Corps rocket fire \u2013 were still ongoing. The Afghan air force began the strikes by dropping bombs from A-29 aircraft, and the United States continued the bombing campaign afterward.\u201cThere are many, many targets that have been identified,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cWe are striking some, and we will continue to strike these targets as we further refine them.\u201dNicholson said that the strikes were not carried out until now, nearly three months after Trump approved his new strategy, because it took extensive preparation and observation by surveillance aircraft to assess the targeted sites. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that there are 400 to 500 opium laboratories across Afghanistan, and about 10 of them have been bombed so far, the general said.\u201cThese strikes required the mapping of their revenue streams, and mapping of their infrastructure in areas where we had not done this before,\u201d Nicholson said.Hundreds of intelligence analysts have been involved, along with hundreds of hours of aerial surveillance, he added.

Coffee managed to exist north of downtown Denver for just short of three years without instigating a racial conflagration.As the Denver Public Library will tell you, the Five Points area used be home to virtually every black resident of the city \u2014 not always by their own choice. The neighborhood became a black cultural center, struggled economically for decades, and then in the 21st century saw a sudden influx of wealth and prestige (e.g., trendy coffee shops) and the corresponding departure of black families who had built the place.That sad irony of history is commonly called gentrification and it's played out in some form in almost every major city in the United States. Which is to say it caused no great furor when Ink opened in long-since gentrified Five Points in December 2014.It was one coffee shop among many, and the latest expansion for a large Colorado chain. It was bright red and shiny metal, with a sign that proclaimed: \"Coffee. Above all else.\"No uproar then, or in 2015, or 2016. Or for most of this year \u2014 until Wednesday afternoon, when a sign spotted outside read: Happily Gentrifying The Neighborhood Since 2014....

Ink! Coffee had apparently drank too much coffee, and therefore accidentally celebrated gentrification....

We hope you will forgive us.\"Many would not.\"It's not that simple,\" as one commenter put it. \"Y'all need to be shut down.\"By the next day, someone had smashed out a window and spray painted \"White Coffee\" across Ink's storefront, the Denver Post reported. \"There was a smaller, more profane message written on the store's main sign,\" the newspaper added.So Ink tried yet another apology. This time the chain's founder Keith Herbert published a thick mea culpa on Facebook, writing that he had thought a proudly gentrifying coffee shop would be seen as a good thing, but now understood his error.\"I am embarrassed to say that I did not fully appreciate the very real and troubling issue of gentrification,\" Herbert wrote. \"When our advertising firm presented this campaign to us, I interpreted it as taking pride in being part of a dynamic, evolving community that is inclusive of people of all races, ethnicities, religions and gender identities. I recognize now that we had a blind spot to other legitimate interpretations. I sincerely apologize \u2014 absolutely and unequivocally.\"This conflicted somewhat with the ad agency's apology \u2014 posted the same day \u2014 which contended that the sign had been meant \"to offer cynical perspective on the rapid development\" of Five Points, but had missed \"the true meaning of gentrification.\"Some were appeased by the contrition, and wished the coffee shop good luck surviving the PR storm.One woman even wrote that she had liked the sign, and hoped gentrification would soon come to her neighborhood.But a local boycott movement was by then growing by the dozen and hundreds, and by Friday the Denver Post still had not been to reach anyone at Ink by phone or in person.That afternoon, a city cleanup crew covered up the \"White Coffee\" scrawled on ink's red bricks....

As I understand it, this is how gentrification works and why it's frustrating to the people who live there: little by little the blacks/whatevers worked hard to make their neighborhood semi-presentable despite being poor as shit and unable to get proper business loans. Then after decades of hard work, white business come in and outcompete the neighborhood business since they have more start-up cash, better credit, and access the better loans. Where /pol/ is going to disagree is that that starup cash and loan opportunity has a lot to do with race and privilege. Whites are on average richer and get loans easier. Isnt it frustrating that as soon as you pull your shit neighborhood out of squalor, whites deem the area acceptable to open business in and drive you out? Shit just moves too fast for black people. Before they can reap any of the benefits from community service/neighborhood development, they get shoved out by people who suddenly aren't utterly disgusted by the place.

", " >>201517I agree that in the long term it looks like a good thing, provided that minorities still have options. Gentrifications very largely a city based problem, and its impossible to ignore the fact that ethnic communities in cities are the poorest and most often gentrified. Yes it's a wealth issue, but in cities wealth is tied pretty fucking closely with race. Literally every time the \"black, latin, chinese, korean\" etc town part of a city has a history of being poor. Yeah I agree it does everything on paper what you said, but its still a humanitarian problem when youre forcing hundreds out of the neighborhoods theyve spent decades in just because some gluten free donut shops opened down the street. That just moves the problem elsewhere, now the crime just goes somewhere else because these people are on hard times again. Nothing gets solved at the end of the process, it just creates a new neighborhood elsewhere waiting to be gentrified ", " >>201522>just creates a new neighborhood elsewhere waiting to be gentrifiedyes, it creates new towns. and poor people are gonna shit it up with crime and shit untill the people who know how to read (see: know how to take advantage of low cost living) move in and fix that neighborhood too. i understand how hard it is to stay out of the criminal system when you're poor, i grew up on welfare, my parents are addicts, i get it. but it really is as simple as that. just stop commiting crimes, just find somewhere that will take you and inch your way up. poor people have the shitty deal yeah. its an issue, yeah. but the only way to get them out of it is to teach them to get themselves out of it. get rid of that poor mentality. because handouts help in the short run but they dont make any money and dont solve problems long term. and it is actually possible to ignore race when looking at social issues that are about class and wealth and not about race, its called being against racism. ", " >>201535Sure, teaching a man to fish is good. But the problem with gentrification is that it happens so quickly. There isnt enough time to raise enough money to go to school, get a good degree, get a job, then save enough money to put a payment down on your house. Prices skyrocket in some neighborhoods within like 5 years, which is a blink of an eye for the issues we're talking about. You just cant compete as a poor uneducated person against an influx of richer people with access to good loans. By the time your family has enough wealth to be stable and own property (maybe one generation if youre hard working and starting from very little) the values in your neighboorhood can easily triple. And they'll rise faster than you can increase your wage. The people purchasing these homes have support networks of wealth that go back multiple generations. Even being middle class for multiple generations is a huge boost. And in a discussion like this, race is still important. Because it isn't more than two, sometimes one generations back that minorities would have a very difficult time getting loans for property, education, or businesses. That puts them at a severe disadvantage compared to people with grandparents who can will them money, and parents who can help with housing downpayments. You can't just bootstrap your way out of a situation like that. I dont know the answer to it all, but I'm just saying that race and racial bias do play a significant role as to why certain neighborhoods are they way they are. ", " >>201551^meant to clarify in the 2nd paragraph:1 to 2 generations back minorities had a tough time getting loans explicitly due to racism, you cant deny that in the 50s,60s, and 70s it would be much harder for a black man to get a housing loan. And basically much, much harder the further back you go. ", " >>201492>all the people talking about property taxes without actually owning propertyProperty tax is based on what the house SOLD for last and increases at a set % every year. The only way to increase it significantly is by selling it for a new higher price. What drives out the poor in gentrification is rent prices spiking. Because most poor people cannot afford to own property, that is how they are driven out by people with more money. ", " >>201565Depends on the region.

As Europe's largest economy, Germany has sheltered the majority of them, leading to widespread objections within the country.Earlier this month, Facebook vowed to clean up what it deemed was racist content on the German version of its website. At the time, the social network said it would partner with a non profit group to oversee hate postings.Yet any action from Facebook is likely to stoke concerns about free speech. In the past, the social network has come under suspicion for suppressing or deleting posts and groups that advocate unpopular beliefs.

When you let them go, they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report, and walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular way.\"Caltech biologist Michael Dickinson, Esther M. and Abe M. Zarem Professor of Bioengineering and Aeronautics, became similarly intrigued by these so-called diving flies\u2014scientifically known as Ephydra hians\u2014on a vacation to Yosemite 22 years ago. Now the principal investigator of a laboratory that specializes in insect flight, Dickinson teamed up with former Caltech postdoctoral scholar Floris van Breugel (now at University of Washington) to study the mysterious behavior of the Mono Lake flies.The two have now characterized the unique adaptations of the Mono Lake fly and the mechanisms it utilizes to crawl underwater without getting wet. The work is published in a paper in the November 20 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"Mono Lake has a very delicate and unique ecosystem,\" says van Breugel. \"Conservationists have fought hard to prevent its loss. We were interested in the Mono Lake flies not only because their behavior is so unusual, but because they are a crucial species for the lake's ecosystem and food web. Mono Lake flies are a crucial component to the local ecosystem, acting as a food source for spiders and for migratory and nesting birds.\"Mono Lake is not an average freshwater lake.  https://phys.org/news/2017-11-strange-case-scuba-diving.html#jCp "}, "replies": [" Not only is it three times saltier than the ocean, it's also full of sodium carbonate and borax\u2014which is essentially laundry detergent. The water's high pH gives it a slippery, almost oily texture.No fish or other vertebrates survive in Mono Lake, though algae and bacteria are abundant. Thus, for a fly, the depths of the lake may seem appealing\u2014there are no predators and plenty of food. However, there's just one hurdle to overcome first: how to stay dry while underwater.To something the size of a tiny fly, water's surface tension is powerful, making it a deadly sticky trap. All insects need to be water repellant, or hydrophobic, in order to coexist with rain and dew in their environments. Most are able to accomplish this by sporting a coating of short bristly hairs covered in a waxy substance, which allows them to repel water for the most part.However, due to its peculiar chemical make-up, Mono Lake water is particularly good at breaking through an average insect's hairy defenses. Van Breugel and Dickinson discovered that this is because the surface of the lake contains a thin layer of negatively charged carbonate ions. When a regular fly gets too close to the water, the ions are attracted to positive charges on the fly's skin and the water is pulled between the protective hairs, wetting the fly.So, how can the Mono Lake fly dive and stay dry in what Dickinson calls \"perhaps the wettest water in the world\"?Using a combination of high-speed video and micro-force measurements in which they plunged flies into a variety of different chemical solutions, van Breugel and Dickinson found that the Mono Lake fly creates a protective bubble of air around its body when crawling into the lakewater. This bubble is a result of an extreme water-repelling phenomenon called superhydrophobicity. ", " The flies are able to do this, the researchers discovered, because they are hairier than the average fly and coat their bodies and hairs with waxes that are particularly effective at repelling the carbonate-rich water. They also have large claws on their feet, which allow them to crawl on underwater rocks while resisting the naturally buoyant force of the bubble. Remarkably, the bubble does not encase the fly's eyes, allowing the fly to see underwater without the bubble's distorting effect.The team compared the performance of Mono Lake flies to a variety of different flies, including some close relatives. No other flies could take a dunk into Mono Lake water without getting wet to a degree that would make escape from the lake unlikely. Additionally, when the Mono Lake flies were briefly rinsed with a solvent (hexane) to dissolve their wax, they lost their ability to form a superhydrophobic bubble, suggesting that the fly's waxes are critical to this phenomenon.\"It's not that Mono Lake flies have evolved a new and unique way of remaining hydrophobic\u2014it's that they've amplified the normal tools that most insects use,\" says Dickinson. \"It's just a killer gig. There's nothing underwater to eat you and you have all the food you want. You've just got to dive in perhaps the most difficult water in which to stay dry on the planet. They figured it out, and so get to enjoy an extremely unique life history. It's amazing how the evolution of such small-scale physical and chemical changes can allow an animal to occupy an entirely new ecological niche.\"The next steps for the project, according to Dickinson, are broad.\"We could go in the materials science direction and study the chemistry of the waxes that the insects use,\" he says. \"But there's also some really interesting neurobiology\u2014it is such an incredibly weird thing for a fly to deliberately crawl underwater.\" ", " Interesting. ", " That is utterly fascinating, especially the part where the fly selectively doesn't have the air bubble around the eyes so it can see better.

Section 702 is intended to be used to authorize federal agencies to surveil communications for foreign targets for anti-terror, anti-espionage, and various national defense purposes.But Americans are increasingly aware that the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) have been using this authority to engage in domestic surveillance against American citizens for purposes far outside the open intent of the law. They're doing so secretly and without warrants, and Americans have little recourse in the matter.As lawmakers consider renewing Section 702, there has been a big push by privacy activists and civil rights organizations to limit what the FBI and NSA may do and to reduce the amount of domestic communications the federal government is allowed to collect and access.But it looks like the Senate Intelligence Committee isn't having it. They're advancing a bill by Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) that does pretty much the opposite of what civil liberties and privacy-minded folks would like and fully codifies that these tools intended for foreign surveillance can and may be used to fight domestic crimes and snoop on American citizens without warrants.cont. "}, "replies": [" >>197810Elizabeth Nolan Brown noted in October how Burr's bill actually advanced the permission to use these snooping powers against Americans. The newly released report shows this is clearly the intent of Burr and the Senate committee. They voted down several amendments to attempt to make it clear that the law is not supposed to be used to snoop on Americans.To wit:The committee rejected a proposed amendment by Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris (both California Democrats) to require the government to get a probable cause warrant from the FISA court for domestic Section 702 search queries.The committee rejected a proposed amendment by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to prohibit using FISA to collect communications without a warrant that are known to be entirely domestic in origin.The committee rejected a proposed amendment by Wyden that would have codified a ban on using FISA to collect communications that are merely \"about\" a subject as opposed to communications that were to or from a subject. The use of \"about\" searches have currently been suspended because they resulted in the federal government getting unwarranted access to all sorts of communications they really had no authority to look at.The committee rejected a proposed amendment by Wyden to stop domestic \"reverse targeting\" via the FISA search authorities. This is a method where the feds target a foreigner for surveillance, but what they really want to do is hear what the people on the other end\u2014including Americans\u2014are saying.The committee rejected a proposed amendment by Wyden to further restrict the use of communications collected via Section 702 in legal proceedings.When the generally terrible Feinstein is the one warning that people's Fourth Amendment rights are being violated, there is definitely a problem. Unfortunately, her courage didn't extend to voting against Burr's bill. Wyden, Harris, and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) were the only \"no\" votes.cont.

When the blueprints are altered, cells can sicken, die or become cancerous. To keep DNA in working order, cells have ways to detect and mend damaged DNA.Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report that they have found a previously unknown way that cells sense a kind of damage induced by certain chemotherapy drugs. The findings, published Nov. 8 in the journal Nature, could have important implications for treating cancer.Some of the oldest chemotherapy drugs are known as alkylating agents because they kill cancer cells by adding groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms to \u2013 or alkylating \u2013 DNA. The extent of the alkylation damage overwhelms the cells\u2019 ability to heal themselves via their DNA repair pathways. And some tumors are abnormally dependent on proteins involved in DNA repair, such that knocking out those proteins kills the tumor cells.\u201cWe found that human cells can sense alkylation damage and mobilize a repair complex specifically suited to repair this kind of injury,\u201d said senior author Nima Mosammaparast, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of pathology and immunology, and co-leader of the DNA Metabolism and Repair Working Group at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cKnocking out this complex may be a way to increase the potency of certain chemotherapy drugs, or to specifically target tumor cells that have become dependent on the repair complex.\u201dAlkylation can happen naturally, which is why cells have this repair system in the first place. Also, certain chemotherapy drugs force it to happen. Busulfan, used to treat leukemia, and temozolomide, prescribed for brain tumors, alkylate many spots along DNA.https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/how-cells-detect-mend-dna-damage-may-improve-chemotherapy/ "}, "replies": [" It is difficult for the genetic blueprint to be copied accurately where DNA has been alkylated, so such alkylation damage kills the cells.Studying cells treated with alkylating chemotherapy drugs or with drugs that lead to other kinds of DNA damage, the researchers determined how cells try to mend DNA damage caused specifically by alkylating agents. They identified a group of proteins that clustered near the spots on the DNA that had been alkylated. Cells that lacked a key member of this protein complex were more likely to die if they were treated with alkylating drugs than cells that had the protein, indicating the importance of the protein complex in repairing DNA. Lacking the key protein made no difference when the DNA was damaged in other ways.These findings suggest that sensing alkylation damage is a major primary defense against chemotherapy drugs such as busulfan and other alkylating agents. Interfering with this repair complex could amplify the killing power of such drugs and potentially even avert or undermine drug resistance. After a successful course of chemotherapy, tumors sometimes recur tougher than before, having become resistant to the drugs from the first round of treatment.\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence now that overexpressing components of this signaling pathway may be how some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy,\u201d Mosammaparast said. \u201cBlocking this pathway could be a way to make resistant tumors sensitive again.\u201dRecurrent tumors are not the only ones that may have high levels of DNA repair proteins. Some tumors that have never encountered alkylating chemotherapy drugs have high levels of key alkylation-repair proteins. And when they do, it portends poorly for the patients. ", " \u201cIn some kinds of pancreatic, prostate and lung cancer, overexpressing components of this pathway indicates a significantly worse prognosis,\u201d Mosammaparast said.There is a possible silver lining, though. Tumors that have high levels of key alkylation repair proteins are often dependent on them, meaning that if those proteins were somehow inhibited, the cells would die. Normal cells are not dependent on this alkylation repair pathway to the same degree. Other repair systems can handle the level of alkylating DNA damage typically encountered by a healthy cell.\u201cThat could be an opening for a chemotherapy drug,\u201d Mosammaparast said. \u201cWe may be able to design a drug that is toxic to tumors but not to normal cells by targeting this alkylation repair pathway.\u201dThe drug olaparib, approved in 2014 to treat hereditary ovarian cancer, exploits a similar vulnerability. It targets tumors that are unusually dependent on a repair pathway that stitches DNA back together after it has been cut into pieces. Olaparib blocks that pathway, and without it, the cancerous cells die. ", " This sounds great, but something in my gut tells me that shutting off a DNA repair pathway to treat cancer cells, which are often caused from mutations in the DNA sequences of a specific group of cells, might not be the most brilliant idea. Also, I'm surprised to see that alkyls are being used to treat cancer. It's like treating cancer with carcinogens. This is strange but intriguing. I'm not an oncologist but this seems fairly risky.

I mean our whole issue in the middle east is we understand moderate muslims but we dont understand the hardcore conservatives. We dont understand that they value women much diffrently.. We need to teach our kids that cultures are diffrent , not that its bad but so they can stay safe. Its a bit like telling people what side of the train tracks they shouldnt cross. ", " >>193358i must add its important to teach the truth with no jingoistic fear mongering. When we teach about other cultures it should be merely to show valuation diffrences and how their thoughts differ. We dont want to just say people from x are bad but rather here is their history here is how they think and what they do. That way people can then abstract their own oppinion on the matter and become more worldly.I think part of our current issue is that for a long time we had a lot of fear mongering about others in our culture ex war on drugs , jim crow etc. This is leading to a rather extreme push back from the other side which causes them to over look inate contradictions in their ideaology ex liberals sidding with hard core isslamist despite the fact hard core islamist treat women like shit. ", " >>193358If you boil it down, any culture that values subjegation or unfair treatment of other person based on factors they did not choose or their personal beliefs and faith are objectivley unethical and even evil. The west is the only society where you could be born as anyone and still be treated equal under the law. Of course people are bad as individuals, but the structure is fair for everyone. Holistically the west is an example of exactly the direction all civilizations should strive towards. Of course we can learn from other cultures, but I would argue that treating the Islamic \"value of women\" as simply a different, equally relevant model is a step in the wrong direction because it prescribes acceptance towards inhumane treatment. ", " >>193348If anything, it's extremely relevant today. Because the same kind of race baiting is being repeated with immigrants to promote authoritarianism.Immigration(and the drug scares associated with them for the last literal century) are used as an excuse to increase police funding. But immigration courts and detainment centers are completely overwhelmed.Rabidly prosecute a racially defined class of people, and never bother to actually process them? We tell them they need to leave. But they can't just pick up their shit and go. If a Mexican went down to the border and tried to cross the other way, and got caught doing so on American soil, he would have to be processed by law.This is a system that keeps them in America indefinitely, hiding or in our legal system, with very few rights. This is eerily familiar to the kind of controls that were placed on African Americans leading up to the civil war, and following it.The left wing(as the party aligned with the cultural north) hedges their philosophy on decriminalizing just -being- an immigrant. But the right wing(as the party currently aligned with the cultural south) doesn't really give us any solutions but more of the same process that doesn't really seem to do anything but increase arrests. ", " >>193374And a point that I failed to mention is that much in the same way, immigrants are used to paint the much wider economic class of the working poor with disdain. An authoritarian, aristocrat, or oligarch's most effective tool of control isn't actually fear. It's the popular disgust of a well-groomed petite bourgeois, dedicated to imitation. Why is it that we always hear crackpot theories of using the poor to thin voting polls, but never the middle class? Why is it that the discussion is so much more often on a middle class, rather than overall quality of life? There seems to be a subtext that says \"through OUR values, you too can climb up the ladder to the proper bourgeois. Everyone will be able to!\" And if that isn't the grooming and molding of a solid cargo cult and voting base, I don't know what in the fuck is. The only difference to me is that one targets the rural poor, and one targets the urban poor when employing this strategy. ", " >>193372>Objectively unethical and even evilExcept the only thing that makes morality objective in Western society is the concept of the divine social contract. >Holistically the west is an example of exactly the direction all civilizations should strive towardsYou want every culture to implode on itself due to overreacting to egregious acts committed in the past?>>193374The difference between African Americans during that era, and illegal immigrants today, is that many of them come here taking the risk that their visa will not get renewed, on the assumption that they will be able to live in America for an extended period of time. African Americans didn't really have a choice in the matter. I'm assuming your comment is about illegal immigration. Illegals are not a racially defined class of people, and there realistically should be a deportation timetable where a person is detained then expedited out of the country if they don't leave after 6 months to a year. You're making this out to be a lot more black and white than it is, with the left wing vs. right wing dichotomy. A lot of Neo cons and Neo liberals are for immediate amnesty, however I would argue that there are those on the far left as well as the far right that are entirely against that idea. ", " >>193353How about we include Koko's scribblings? Don't want to discriminate against non-humans. ", " >>192737Oscar Wilde was a flamer and it's debated as to whether Walt Whitman was gay. I would imagine there are several famous authors that were gay. It's the focus on removing literature written by white people strictly because they're white that irritates me. I hope they remove Uncle Tom's Cabin because it's offensive. ", " >>193376I think there's definitely some association with immigrant and Hispanic ethnicity going on. Definitely not as black-and-white as I made it out to be. But how often do we concern ourselves with Asian or European immigration in this debate? ", " >>193383Depends on who you're having the debate with. I suppose it's relevant that central americans make up the majority of illegal immigrants so there is going to be racially charged rhetoric. It doesn't help that many do not speak english fluently. It is one argument that many have against illegal immigration in the United States. The biggest on in general that is against immigrants in general is about the impossibility for assimilation and the artificial increase of labor that helps to keep wages depressed, and lowers the bargaining ability of unions. In general, illegal immigration is great for corporations and for a voting block, which is why both Neo Cons and Neo Liberals like it generally. ", " >>193376Evil is anything unnecessarily causes suffering to the individual, or denies them their inherent rights. If you want to believe that divine contract doesn't exist, or that morality doesn't exist then you can live in that world. Christian west is leaps and bounds more civil and just than anything that has ever existed on the planet, despite the shortcomings of human nature. Stive towards offering every individual hegemony over their own path in life would be ideal. Slavery, subjegation, slaughter, and group think are the only alternative to individual freedom. ", " >>193396I think we're agreeing. I'm just saying that you need to believe in the divine social contract for Western Society to work. The fact that so many people in American and Western Europe reject it is why we're having problems today. ", " >>193386And so the argument is really about workers rights as often as it's about borderless humanitarianism. Bones to the meat.But there's a connection here that I was trying to draw. Slaveholders told poor southern whites that they be able to bargain for their own wages when competing with free blacks. But the irony here was that they were already competing with people who had -no- bargaining power. A threat was made that the bar would be set low, but the bar was already lower than anything short of unpaid labor. This is the kind of environment that I'm worried we create in criminalizing immigration. Illegal immigrants who are hiding from the law still have needs to be met. They need money. They do work. But because they can't interface with the law on fear of detainment, then they have -no- legal protections in work.Emancipation can be argued to be productive option for the same reason. With legal protections, they can bargain collectively with citizens in the same economic class for a better situation. As citizens, their interests align with native citizens. And as consumers they create the same demand, relative to their own incomes, that any native-born citizen within their economic class does. If it's all relative, then we're asking of ourselves to just have less poor people in general. And if the issue isn't race, but immigration and economic, then that's another can of worms entirely, right? ", " >>193399(cont.)I think the situation can be abstracted. There is a demographic of people currently living here, who through some circumstance do not have the same officially recognized standard of citizenship as the rest of us.There are economic and political reasons for this to either stay that way, to remove them from the society entirely, or to effectively emancipate them. But as it stands, it's entirely beneficial to an established elite for the status quo to be protected. It's unhumanitarian(look at liberia) to remove them entirely. And there are emancipating a previously disenfranchised demographic is much more difficult and lengthy a process, rife with more un-forseen consequences, than the most idealistic of us would like to think. ", " >>193386which is much like pre civil war slavery. The people who wanted to keep slavery were the few elites in control of vast stretches of plantations . they controlled the poor white southern population through building racist charecters of blacks, along with promoting the idea that despite living in shit conditions the poor white farmers were some how better.Once the civil war actually happened a lot of the poor white farmers became quickly disillusioned with the rich financiers of the confederacy seeing that they lived in a totally diffrent world compared to them.The illegal migrants wouldnt be comming here if no one hired them. employers know when someone overstays their visia but they dont care because its cheap labor that cant sue you for shitty work conditions or treatment.Now through in sanctuary cities which resemble the abolitionists attempt to shelter escaped slaves or in this case migrants that over stayed their visas , the civil war comparisons become even more apt. ", " >>193396ah another classical liberal. We seem to be a rare breed these days with all the neocons and neo liberals... Its sad really that we find classical liberals treated with the same disdain that anarchist recive. ", " >>193400Its funny how quickly the trolls shut up when multiple reasonable people have discussions. I thibk thats the real issue with our nation we promote the ideaologically brash and extream and say that since we both give them equal air time thats some how making it moderate. ", " >>193339I (>>193333) am not the \"angry credit guy\". I am only >>193333 and >>193276 here. ", " >>193402Your analysis of the war is completely off base. The reason why the war started is because the South wanted states to be able to determine whether to enter the union as slave or free. The north wanted to contain slavery to the states where it existed. The poor white farmers didn't become disillusioned with the rich financiers of the confederacy. Nobody wanted the war which is why it was unpopular. The South was constitutionally allowed to secede, and the North wanted to seize back federal property (i.e. Military bases). Since the states believed this to be an invasion of what they perceived as their land, the war started. You mention that white farmers were living in terrible conditions but that also couldn't be further from the truth. Due to the trail of tears by Andrew Jackson, there was plenty of land that these farmers could use and harvest for cheap. The economy of the south crashed due to the civil war and shermans march to the sea, and some states haven't recovered since. Comparing sanctuary cities to escaped free slaves (i.e. Someone who came here willingly assuming they were going to get permenant residence) is disingenuous and downplays the actual issues caused by slavery. >illegal immigrants wouldnt be comming here if no one hired them.And those who do hire them are doing so illegally, however most use temporary visas, which is what many are pushing for to end. Immigrants who have a visa about to expire should make plans to return to their host country. Citizenship is a privilege for those born outside the US, not a right.

But more than a dozen other groups said they hadn't received any donations at all or had no record of such donations.Among the groups listed on the golf course's website that did not receive donations from the club were organizations like the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation, which provides support for children who suffer severe burns, and the California Department of Veterans Affairs, according to NPR. The donations that were verified were almost entirely in-kind donations, meaning the golf club provided goods and services as opposed to money, NPR's Tom Dreisbach reported.The organizations that the golf club claimed it had donated to were listed on its website as recently as June 30, though they were removed sometime between then and Oct. 2, according to a snapshots of the page captured by the Internet Archive.As of June 30, about 170 groups were listed on Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles's philanthropy page. The claim that the club has \"provided approximately $5 million\" to the listed charities has since been removed from the page, though a description of the page on the website's navigation menu still makes the claim.NPR said that the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment during its reporting.Trump has received scrutiny over his claims about charitable givings or donations pledges in the past.

When most people hear \u2018foundation\u2019, they think exclusively of a grant-making entity. In either case, the key is to understand how well the foundation uses money \u2014 whether to implement programs or to grant out to nonprofits \u2014 [to achieve] the intended social impact (e.g., improving education, creating livelihoods, improving health, etc.).\u201d>Craig Minassian, chief communications officer for the Clinton Foundation, said the Clinton Foundation is \u201can implementer.\u201d\u201cWe operate programs on the ground, around the world, that are making a difference on issues ranging from poverty and global health to climate change and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 participation,\u201d Minassian told us via email. \u201cMany large foundations actually provide grants to the Clinton Foundation so that our staff can implement the work.\u201d...>When considering the amount spent on \u201ccharitable work,\u201d she said, one would look not just at the amount in grants given to other charities, but all of the expenses in Column B for program services.

The new law requires social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to censor their users on behalf of the German state. Social media companies are obliged to delete or block any online \"criminal offenses\" such as libel, slander, defamation or incitement, within 24 hours of receipt of a user complaint -- regardless of whether or the content is accurate or not. Social media companies receive seven days for more complicated cases. If they fail to do so, the German government can fine them up to 50 million euros for failing to comply with the law.This state censorship makes free speech subject to the arbitrary decisions of corporate entities that are likely to censor more than absolutely necessary, rather than risk a crushing fine. When employees of social media companies are appointed as the state's private thought police and given the power to shape the form of current political and cultural discourse by deciding who shall be allowed to speak and what to say, and who shall be shut down, free speech becomes nothing more than a fairy taleMeanwhile, the district court in Munich recently sentenced a German journalist, Michael St\u00fcrzenberger, to six months in jail for posting on his Facebook page a historical photo of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, shaking the hand of a senior Nazi official in Berlin in 1941. The prosecution accused St\u00fcrzenberger of \"inciting hatred towards Islam\" and \"denigrating Islam\" by publishing the photograph. The court found St\u00fcrzenberger guilty of \"disseminating the propaganda of anti-constitutional organizations\". While the mutual admiration that once existed between al-Husseini and German Nazis is an undisputed historical fact, now evidently history is being rewritten by German courts.

A lone Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, supported the measure. The only Democrat to vote against it was Joe Manchin from West Virginia.Conservationists and many Democrats treasure the Alaskan reserve, also known as ANWR, as one of the planet\u2019s last paradises. Established by Congress in 1980, it is home to tribes and a habitat for sensitive wildlife including caribou, polar bears and hundreds of species of migratory birds.Republicans, who now control Congress and the White House, have long wanted to open a portion of ANWR called the 1002 area. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chair of the Senate energy committee and an Alaskan Republican, called the 1002 portion a \u201cnon wilderness area\u201d because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the area on the Prudhoe Bay in Northern Alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude.A Senate budget measure introduced this fall instructed Murkowski\u2019s committee to raise $1 billion over 10 years. She hopes some of that money will come from energy company royalties after opening the 1002 area to drilling. Murkowski urged senators to see the \u201cinstruction as an opportunity to do something constructive\u201d and focus on boosting energy output from federal lands that have long been off limit.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-arctic/democrats-fail-to-block-arctic-reserve-oil-drilling-idUSKBN1CO36H "}, "replies": [" The failed amendment, sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, would have eliminated the directive from the budget resolution seeking to raise funds.Republicans led a \u201csneak attack\u201d that turned \u201cpublic lands over to polluters,\u201d Cantwell said. Senator Jeff Merkley, another Democrat, has said there is \u201csomething cynical and sad\u201d about the effort to open ANWR because it would boost oil output from the state feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which a majority of scientists link to carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and development.The battle is not over. The House of Representatives will next have to pass its version of a plan to raise revenues from the drilling. A final budget package would then be worked out by leaders from the two chambers.Petroleum interests have long lobbied to explore in the area and say technology advances mean the impact of operations in the reserve would be small. Murkowski said oil companies could use infrared cameras to detect and avoid polar bear dens while exploring for oil and gas.It is uncertain whether energy companies that have faced years of static crude prices amid a wealth of oil in the continental United States would be willing to increase drilling in the harsh and frigid Arctic.Environmentalists vowed to keep up their fight. \u201cCongress cannot sneak this through the back door when they think nobody is looking,\u201d said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society.

That is my race. I can't wait to go to Africa because I hear the food is tasty.'It's better to be black, the feeling inside is just better.'

", " There was a shooter on the roof at the Delano according to sound analysis which puts bullet lag time at 0.699 seconds from hitting near the stage to a muzzle report. In order to get that disparity the shot from a bullet traveling at 3020fps would need to travel about 525 yards. Taking the bullet 0.65 seconds to arrive and strike a nearby object which can be heard immediately and then you have the sound from the bullet being fired which arrives 0.699 seconds after the strike is heard. This means the total time from actual shot of the bullet to the shot being heard is 1.397 seconds. Speed of sound is about 1138fps which puts the distance of that particular shooter at 525yards or 1575 feet from the south side of the venue where the video was taken. The video I used was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpsqirFRdTo and the shots I used were at 3:04 where you can hear the last two shots slap the pavement and the very last report from the gunfire. The Delano is the only logical perch at 1575 feet from that vantage point. When put into sound software you can clearly measure the lag. Its possible shots were not accounted for but it puts the distance right on the south edge of the Delano which would explain how windows on the north/west side of the Mandalay were shot out. The other shots I analyzed were about 751 feet from the northwest corner of the stage and another had shots about 822 feet from the south side of the venue in the balcony, the rate of fire for the balcony video (same video at 3:49) was 789 rounds per minute which is consistent with a SAW249 belt fed or drum fed.

This trend is leading to expanded waistlines and driving an epidemic of diabetes and heart disease that threatens to overwhelm Ghana\u2019s already fragile health system.As globalization has accelerated, an emerging middle class has embraced sedentary lifestyles and Western fast food diets. Year after year, new data reconfirms the growing scale of the obesity crisis in every country of the world, and yet political action has been muted.It is easy to blame the private sector for this, but should the public health community be exonerated? In the past, it has traditionally responded to major public health crises with relatively fitting solutions. To halt millions of children dying from preventable disease every year, a children\u2019s vaccine initiative was set up in the 1990s. Later on Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance was established, aspiring to make lifesaving vaccines ubiquitous for children. And as the HIV epidemic spread, the world responded by setting up a United Nations agency solely dedicated to tackling the disease and a new Global Fund to marshal new resources.But when it comes to the world\u2019s biggest killer diseases\u2014heart disease and diabetes\u2014brought on by obesity, no commensurate action is taken.

Others have rejected the supposed decrease in male fertility as a medical myth.>According to a new study, not only is the quality of sperm declining, but so is the quantity, at least in Western men. The study found that, between 1973 and 2011, the sperm count of men from Western countries declined by more than 50 percent\u2014and the trend does not appear to be stopping.>The study, published in the journal Human Reproduction Update on Tuesday, measured both sperm concentration and total sperm count. Sperm concentration refers to the number of sperm per milliliter of semen; total sperm count refers to the overall number of sperm per sample. Both are recognized measures of the quality of human sperm.>The study found that sperm concentration declined 1.4 percent per year between 1973 and 2011, resulting in an overall drop of 52.4 percent. Total sperm count went down by 1.6 percent each year, resulting in a slightly higher overall decline of 59.3 percent in the study period.>According to the study\u2019s lead author, the results are a big concern. \u201cFor the couples who are trying to conceive, this is a very severe problem; it\u2019s a big expense, and it\u2019s very difficult psychologically,\u201d says Shanna Swan, professor of environmental medicine and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. "}, "replies": [" >But Swan says the results have broader public health implications too. Recent studies have shown that low sperm count is associated with other health problems\u2014including high cancer and heart disease risks, major causes of mortality in the U.S. and elsewhere\u2014although poor sperm count has not been proved as a cause of such issues. \u201cSo men with poor sperm counts tend to die earlier,\u201d says Swan.>The present study, by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\u2019s Hadassah-Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine, was actually a meta-analysis\u2014or study of studies\u2014of 185 papers from 1973 to 2011, which covered 244 sperm concentration estimates derived from samples collected from almost 43,000 men.>The trends observed applied only to Western men, defined as coming from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Researchers did not observe a similar decline in non-Western men\u2014those from Africa, Asia and South America\u2014but admitted that this absence of a trend may be due to a lack of data. The analysis also took into account only previous studies conducted in English.>The study found a difference between men who had previously conceived a child\u2014identified as \u201cfertile\u201d\u2014and men who had never had a child and were presumed to be unaware of their fertility levels, who were referred to as \u201cunselected.\u201d Fertile men experienced a less significant decline in sperm concentration and sperm count than \u201cunselected\u201d men.>The researchers wrote that the analysis provided evidence of a \u201csignificant overall decline\u201d in both sperm concentration and total sperm count, and that \u201cthere was no sign of \u2018leveling off\u2019 of the decline.\u201d ", " >>The meta-analysis included only studies where sperm concentration was measured using a cell-counting device known as a hemocytometer, which the World Health Organization recommends as the best method. This approach makes the study more reliable than previous analyses of sperm quantity, says Allan Pacey, who teaches about male diseases and conditions at the University of Sheffield in the U.K.>But Pacey, who was not involved in the study, says it should be treated with caution. While the 52.4 percent decline in sperm concentration \u201cmay sound a lot,\u201d says Pacey, the sperm were still plentiful. The decline represented a decrease from 99 million sperm per milliliter (in 1973) to 47 million sperm per milliliter (in 2011), and the latter number still falls within the \u201cnormal\u201d range for sperm concentration.>While the researchers did not investigate the causes of a decline in sperm count, Swan says the problem starts while the male embryo is developing in its mother\u2019s womb. Exposure to certain chemicals, maternal or paternal smoking and the mother\u2019s stress levels and diet can all impact the embryo\u2019s reproductive organs, which develop in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, other research has claimed that there is little evidence linking reduced sperm counts to prenatal and postnatal exposure to certain chemicals.>Swan also says further research is required to identify which chemicals contribute to falling sperm counts. And when they are identified, says Swan, regulation should be introduced to protect men from their effects. She cites the example of a chemical that was used in pesticides, dibromochloropropane, before its negative effects on male fertility were identified; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned its use in 1979. ", " >Fertility rates in the Western world are among the lowest across the globe. North American couples have an average of 1.9 children, compared with 4.7 children per couple in Africa, according to a 2015 U.N. report. If declining sperm counts reduce fertility, then that problem is likely to be compounded by women delaying pregnancy until they are in their 30s, according to Richard Sharpe, honorary professor at the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh.

It offers a rare glimpse into how the intelligence community thinks Russian intelligence exploits a widely available commercial software product to spy on the U.S.The incident occurred in 2015 but wasn\u2019t discovered until spring of last year, said the people familiar with the matter.The stolen material included details about how the NSA penetrates foreign computer networks, the computer code it uses for such spying and how it defends networks inside the U.S., these people said.Having such information could give the Russian government information on how to protect its own networks, making it more difficult for the NSA to conduct its work. It also could give the Russians methods to infiltrate the networks of the U.S. and other nations, these people said.The breach is the first known incident in which Kaspersky software is believed to have been exploited by Russian hackers to conduct espionage against the U.S. government. The company, which sells its antivirus products in the U.S., had revenue of more than half a billion dollars in Western Europe and the Americas in 2016, according to International Data Corp. Kaspersky says it has more than 400 million users world-wide. "}, "replies": [" >>184655The revelation comes as concern over Russian infiltration of American computer networks and social media platforms is growing amid a U.S. special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign sought or received assistance from the Russian government. Mr. Trump denies any impropriety and has called the matter a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIntelligence officials have concluded that a campaign authorized by the highest levels of the Russian government hacked into state election-board systems and the email networks of political organizations to damage the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.A spokesman for the NSA didn\u2019t comment on the security breach. \u201cWhether the information is credible or not, NSA\u2019s policy is never to comment on affiliate or personnel matters,\u201d he said. He noted that the Defense Department, of which the NSA is a part, has a contract for antivirus software with another company, not Kaspersky.In a statement, Kaspersky Lab said it \u201chas not been provided any information or evidence substantiating this alleged incident, and as a result, we must assume that this is another example of a false accusation.\u201dKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a statement didn\u2019t address whether the Russian government stole NSA materials using Kaspersky software. But he criticized the U.S. government\u2019s decision to ban the software from use by U.S. agencies as \u201cundermining the competitive positions of Russian companies on the world arena.\u201dSen. Jeanne Shaheen, (D., N.H.) on Thursday asked the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the issue. \u201cAs you are aware, I have been concerned about the serious dangers of using Kaspersky software due to the company\u2019s strong ties to the Kremlin,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee chairman.She urged Mr. McCain to \u201cexpeditiously\u201d schedule a hearing with Adm. Rogers and other administration officials.. ", " >>184656The Kaspersky incident is the third publicly known breach at the NSA involving a contractor\u2019s access to a huge trove of highly classified materials. It prompted an official letter of reprimand to the agency\u2019s director, Adm. Michael Rogers, by his superiors, people familiar with the situation said. Adm. Rogers came into his post in 2014 promising to staunch leaks after the disclosure that NSA contractor Edward Snowden the year before gave classified documents to journalists that revealed surveillance programs run by the U.S. and allied nations.The Kaspersky-linked incident predates the arrest last year of another NSA contractor, Harold Martin, who allegedly removed massive amounts of classified information from the agency\u2019s headquarters and kept it at his home, but wasn\u2019t thought to have shared the data.Mr. Martin pleaded not guilty to charges that include stealing classified information. His lawyer has said he took the information home only to get better at his job and never intended to reveal secrets.The name of the NSA contractor in the Kaspersky-related incident and the company he worked for aren\u2019t publicly known. People familiar with the matter said he is thought to have purposely taken home numerous documents and other materials from NSA headquarters, possibly to continue working beyond his normal office hours.The man isn\u2019t believed to have wittingly aided a foreign government, but knew that removing classified information without authorization is a violation of NSA policies and potentially a criminal act, said people with knowledge of the breach. It is unclear whether he has been dismissed from his job or faces charges. The incident remains under federal investigation, said people familiar with the matter. ", " >>184657Kaspersky software once was authorized for use by nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies, including the Army, Navy and Air Force, and the departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, Energy, Veterans Affairs, Justice and Treasury.NSA employees and contractors never had been authorized to use Kaspersky software at work. While there was no prohibition against these employees or contractors using it at home, they were advised not to before the 2015 incident, said people with knowledge of the guidance the agency gave.For years, U.S. national security officials have suspected that Kaspersky Lab, founded by a computer scientist who was trained at a KGB-sponsored technical school, is a proxy of the Russian government, which under Russian law can compel the company\u2019s assistance in intercepting communications as they move through Russian computer networks.Kaspersky said in its statement: \u201cAs a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts.\u201dSuspicions about the company prompted the Department of Homeland Security last month to take the extraordinary step of banning all U.S. government departments and agencies from using Kaspersky products and services. Officials determined that \u201cmalicious cyber actors\u201d could use the company\u2019s antivirus software to gain access to a computer\u2019s files, said people familiar with the matter.The government\u2019s decision came after months of intensive discussions inside the intelligence community, as well as a study of how the software works and the company\u2019s suspected connections to the Russian government, said people familiar with the events. ", " >>184659They said intelligence officials also were concerned that given the prevalence of Kaspersky on the commercial market, countless people could be targeted, including family members of senior government officials, or that Russia could use the software to steal information for competitive economic advantage.\u201cThe risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security,\u201d the DHS said Sept. 13 in announcing the government ban.All antivirus software scans computers looking for malicious code, comparing what is on the machine to a master list housed at the software company. But that scanning also gives makers of the software an inventory of what is on the computer, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s basically the equivalent of digital dumpster diving,\u201d said Blake Darch\u00e9, a former NSA employee who worked in the agency\u2019s elite hacking group that targets foreign computer systems.Kaspersky is \u201caggressive\u201d in its methods of hunting for malware, Mr. Darch\u00e9 said, \u201cin that they will make copies of files on a computer, anything that they think is interesting.\u201d He said the product\u2019s user license agreement, which few customers probably read, allows this.\u201cYou\u2019re basically surrendering your right to privacy by using Kaspersky software,\u201d said Mr. Darch\u00e9, who is chief security officer for Area 1, a computer security company.\u201cWe aggressively detect and mitigate malware infections no matter the source and we have been proudly doing it for 20 years,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cWe make no apologies for being aggressive in the battle against malware and cybercriminals.\u201d ", " >>184660U.S. investigators believe the contractor\u2019s use of the software alerted Russian hackers to the presence of files that may have been taken from the NSA, according to people with knowledge of the investigation. Experts said the software, in searching for malicious code, may have found samples of it in the data the contractor removed from the NSA.But how the antivirus system made that determination is unclear, such as whether Kaspersky technicians programed the software to look for specific parameters that indicated NSA material. Also unclear is whether Kaspersky employees alerted the Russian government to the finding.Investigators did determine that, armed with the knowledge that Kaspersky\u2019s software provided of what files were suspected on the contractor\u2019s PC, hackers working for Russia homed in on the machine and obtained a large amount of information, said the people familiar with the matter.The breach illustrates the chronic problem the NSA has had with keeping highly classified secrets from spilling out, former intelligence personnel say. They say they were rarely searched while entering or leaving their workplaces to see if they were carrying classified documents or removable storage media, such as a thumb drive.Then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter and then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed President Barack Obama to remove Adm. Rogers as NSA head, due in part to the number of data breaches on his watch, according to several officials familiar with the matter.The NSA director had fallen out of White House favor when he traveled to Bedminster, N.J., last November to meet with president-elect Donald Trump about taking a job in his administration, said people familiar with the matter. Adm. Rogers didn\u2019t notify his superiors, an extraordinary step for a senior military officer, U.S. officials said.

The evaluations TERA produced consistently failed to recognize threats that were clear to scientists and regulators not on the companies\u2019 payrolls.>If confirmed as director of the EPA\u2019s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, Dourson will be in a position to set safety levels for many of the same chemicals his company was paid to defend, including nine pesticides scheduled for scrutiny and 20 industrial compounds that may be evaluated under the recently updated chemical safety law.>Dourson would also be in a position to make decisions affecting chlorpyrifos, another pesticide he\u2019s been paid to research, which can cause memory, intelligence, attention, and motor problems in children. Based on numerous studies that found that very low doses of the pesticide can harm children\u2019s brains, the EPA proposed banning chlorpyrifos in 2016.

Dourson would have input on the timing of those evaluations, as well as the research considered in them. About two dozen organophosphate pesticides are commercially available, all of which are neurotoxins.>Environmental scientists have long recognized that children are especially vulnerable to chemicals, including organophosphates, throughout their development. But in a 2002 paper paid for by the American Chemistry Council and the pesticide industry group CropLife America, Dourson suggested that after six months, most children are no more sensitive to chemical toxicity than adults and that in some cases, they are even less sensitive. This idea places him well outside the scientific mainstream and suggests how he might approach not just these pesticides but all chemicals affecting children.>In addition to overseeing pesticides if confirmed, Dourson would be responsible for the implementation of the new Toxic Substances Control Act, which entails setting safety levels for some of the most dangerous chemicals in use. As the 2016 law required, the EPA has already chosen the first 10 substances to be evaluated. Of those 10, Dourson has been paid to work on three \u2014 Trichloroethylene, 1-Bromopropane, and 1,4-Dioxane \u2014 and in each case, found them to be safer than independent scientists did. ", " >>184055>Often the standards TERA recommended weren\u2019t just off, they were wildly off. In the research commissioned by manufacturers of 1-Bromopropane, which the EPA is considering adding to its list of hazardous air pollutants, TERA put forward a safety level that was 67 times higher than one recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. For 1,4-Dioxane, a solvent that harms the liver, kidneys, and nervous system, TERA calculated a safety level that was 1,166 time less protective than that of the EPA.>For PFOA, a chemical used to make nonstick products that has been found in the drinking water of 6.5 million Americans, Dourson helped West Virginia set a state safety standard in 2002 that was 150 times higher than an internal level DuPont itself had set years earlier and 7,500 time higher than the lowest standard set by a state.>TERA consulted on another 17 worrisome chemicals \u2014 including lead, arsenic, and the carcinogens chromium and benzene \u2014 that the EPA has identified as needing further assessment as part of the Toxic Substances Control Act Work Plan.>In 2015, Dourson and TERA joined the University of Cincinnati and rebranded as the Risk Science Center. Since then, Dourson has co-authored at least one scientific paper with staff of the American Chemistry Council, Dow Chemical, and Exxon.>Dourson and the EPA declined repeated requests to answer questions for this article.>After Dourson\u2019s nomination was announced in July, the agency issued a press release that cited \u201cwidespread praise\u201d for the toxicologist from his colleagues. \u201cDr. Dourson has a can do and winning temperament that inspires confidence,\u201d said Gio Batta Gori, who, like Dourson, has consulted for tobacco companies. ", " >>184056>Chemical safety advocates say the overlap between Dourson\u2019s work and the chemicals under EPA scrutiny isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cThese companies aren\u2019t hiring Dourson if their product is hunky-dory,\u201d said Jack Pratt, chemicals campaign director for the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cHe comes in when they\u2019ve got a fire. Over and over, he\u2019s the guy that chemical companies hire when some regulator looks at their products and might potentially set a regulation.\u201d>This coziness with industry has led environmental groups to wage a vocal campaign against Dourson, one of four nominees to high-level EPA positions being considered by the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works committee this week.>\u201cIt\u2019s simply absurd that industry\u2019s go-to science-for-hire guy would now be charged with reviewing the safety of many of the same chemicals he\u2019s previously greenwashed,\u201d said Scott Faber, senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, which has dubbed Dourson Mr. Pay to Spray. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting Philip Morris in charge of the American Lung Association.\u201d>Patti Goldman, an attorney at Earthjustice, also strongly opposes his confirmation. But she has already begun focusing on how to limit the harm Dourson could cause if confirmed. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s been a scientist for hire, Dourson should recuse himself from decisions affecting chemicals he\u2019s worked on,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Dourson to be free of bias. What\u2019s he going to do, cite his own studies?\u201d ", " can't they just drop the stupid facade about concern for human health and preserving ecologyif they're going to be all in for what businesses want right now for their bottom line, then just do that and scrap the EPA. why treat us all like we're retarded too ", " >>184066Because, and I don't mean to be inflammatory, there are people who support this and they are actually retarded.

In the email, he asked his longtime employee Konstantin Kilimnik to offer Deripaska \"private briefings\" about the campaign.\u201cIf he needs private briefings we can accommodate,\u201d Manafort wrote.Manafort had written a cryptic note to Kilimnik, a Russian-Ukrainian operative with suspected ties to Russian intelligence, shortly after being named a campaign strategist in April.\"How do we use to get whole?\" he said.The New York Times reported in July that Manafort was in debt to pro-Russian interests by as much as $17 million by the time he joined the Trump campaign. His emails are being examined as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and whether the Trump campaign played any part.Jason Maloni, a representative for Manafort, told The Washington Post that Manafort had simply been trying to leverage his high-level role on the campaign to collect past debts.But it was Manafort who, according to Deripaska, owed him money \u2014 not vice versa. "}, "replies": [" Legal complaints filed by Deripaska's representatives in the Cayman Islands in 2014 said he gave Manafort $19 million that year to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable. The project fell through, and Manafort all but disappeared without paying Deripaska back, the filings claimed. In early 2016, Deripaska's representatives \"openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him,\" according to The Associated Press. \"After Trump earned the nomination [in May], Deripaska\u2019s representatives said they would no longer discuss the case.\"A spokesperson for Deripaska's company, Rusal, did not respond to a request for comment.Deripaska and Manafort had worked together before. Deripaska signed a $10 million annual contract with Manafort in 2006, according to the AP, for a lobbying project in the US that Manafort said would \"greatly benefit the Putin Government.\"Deripaska took out quarter-page ads in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post in March, after his payments to Manafort were revealed, announcing that he was \"ready to take part in any hearings conducted in the US Congress on this subject in order to defend my reputation and name.\" In 2008, Manafort and Deripaska looked into buying New York City's Drake Hotel and turning it into a luxury apartment building, The Daily Beast reported in August. The $850 million project would have been funded by an offshore private equity fund Manafort and Deripaska founded in 2006, but the deal ultimately fell through, according to the report.Reports that Manafort continued reaching out to Deripaska after their falling out in 2014, however, indicate that Manafort was still trying to make things right by the Russian oligarch as of 2016 \u2014 including after he was brought on to the Trump campaign. ", " Ukraine, hacked emails, a trip to Moscow, and a resignation It is unclear what Manafort offered to Deripaska beyond the private briefings, which both parties have insisted never actually materialized. It is also unclear whether Manafort ever cashed in from his role on the campaign.But the contact between Manafort and Deripaska \u2014 Manafort's email, \"if he needs private briefings we can accomodate,\" suggests it was not the first time the subject had been raised \u2014 had all of the hallmarks of a \"classic intelligence operation being run by the Russians,\" said former CIA operative Glenn Carle.\"This is how it is done,\" said Carle, who served 23 years in the CIA as the deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats.\"Approach someone with access and influence [like Manafort], propose benign-seeming justifications, offer an enticement, get benign-seeming favors done by the target in exchange (e.g., a meeting, a briefing, information that seems non-alarming), and use the meeting to entice down the primrose path \u2014 either without informing the target or directly with his knowledge.\"Manafort's accession to campaign chairman coincided with some of the more brazen Russia-related episodes during the campaign. That included a change in the GOP's Ukraine platform at the Republican National Convention, the release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails, and an early foreign policy adviser's trip to Moscow.As Politico's Michael Crowley has reported, Trump's tone on Ukraine and Crimea appeared to shift after he hired Manafort to manage his campaign. Approximately 10 days after Manafort emailed Kilimnik with his offer to Deripaska, an amendment to the Republican Party's draft policy on Ukraine proposing that the GOP commit to sending \"lethal weapons\" to the Ukrainian army to fend off Russian aggression was changed to \"provide appropriate assistance.\" ", " Politico reported last year that Kilimnik had suggested upon returning to Kiev from the US that he he played a role in altering the amendment.The original amendment seemed consistent with language used by a group of Republican senators as early as 2014, when many in the GOP were actively pressuring the Obama administration to send \"anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons and small arms\" to the Ukrainian army to fend off Russian aggression. A bipartisan coalition in Congress ramped up that pressure in June 2015, and again 18 months later.\"We renew our call for the United States to increase political, economic, and military support for Ukraine,\"a bipartisan group of high-profile senators wrote in December 2016. \"This includes defensive lethal assistance as part of a broader effort to help Ukrainians better defend themselves, deter future aggression, and implement key structural reforms.\"But the original language \u2014 proposed by GOP delegate Diana Denman at a meeting of the party's national-security subcommittee in Cleveland just before the convention \u2014 was watered down after two Trump campaign representatives asked the chairs of the committee to table the amendment and delay deliberations.One of the representatives, JD Gordon, initially denied intervening in the process. \"As the Trump campaign's national-security policy representative for the GOP convention, I never left my assigned side table, nor spoke publicly at the meeting of delegates during GOP platform hearing,\" Gordon told Business Insider in January. \"So yes, Ms. Denham's [sic] memory of events is inaccurate.\"Two months later, however, Gordon told CNN that he pushed to alter the amendment to further align it with Trump's views.The change aligns with an assertion made in an unverified dossier alleging ties between Trump and Moscow that the campaign agreed to soften US support for Ukraine in exchange for the Kremlin releasing damaging information about Hillary Clinton. ", " The altered Ukraine policy amendment, with the softer language, ultimately was included in the new GOP platform. A few days later, WikiLeaks began publishing the emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The timing coincided with the start of the Democratic National Convention the following week. It was around the time that Manafort wrote to Deripaska offering private briefings that Carter Page, an early foreign policy adviser to the campaign, was in Moscow giving a speech at Russia's New Economic School.The dossier, which was presented by top intelligence officials to Trump in January and was reportedly used to bolster the FBI's case to surveil Page late last year, alleged that Page served as an intermediary for the communication between Russia and the campaign that Manafort oversaw. Page and Manafort, for their part, have said they never met each other. A month after the Republican convention, on August 14, The New York Times reported new details about Manafort's involvement with Ukraine. The paper reported that Ukraine leader Yanukovych's pro-Russia political party had earmarked $12.7 million for Manafort for his work between 2007 and 2012. Manafort has said he never collected the payments. The New York Times story thrust the Trump campaign's connections with Russia into the international spotlight. Five days later, on August 19, Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign manager amid a broader campaign shakeup that brought on Steve Bannon as the head of the campaign. ", " The dossier further alleges that Putin became concerned when Yanukovych informed him on August 16 \u2014 two days after the Times report was published \u2014 of \"kickback payments\" being funneled to Manafort. Three days later, Manafort resigned.Carle said the events make it \"overwhelmingly clear\" that Manafort was \"one element of a coherent intelligence operation.\"\"Even if Manafort is unaware of the implications of his actions, he nonetheless engaged in espionage-related activities with the Russians,\" Carle said. \"I have known many 'targets,' or sources, to be destroyed for such associations once they came to light. Because every counter-intelligence service in the world will recognize these classic intelligence, cooptation, exploitation, collusion activities.\"[End of Story] ", " One other salient detail that should be mentioned is that shortly after Trump won the GOP nomination and changed the party platform on aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, Deripaska dropped the million dollar lawsuit he was bringing against manafort. ", " fake news ", " and? Whats the problem?ris anyone now with Russia ethnicity now supposed to be an enemy of the state? ", " The crazy russia hysteria and conspiracy theories continue. It's gotten to the point that anyone with a russia sounding name that ever did business with anyone trump has ever met is some kind of fuel for this lunacy that has been debunked time and time again.Are they still trying to claim money \"laundering\" because trump sold a house to a Russian? Or has that died like the collusion nonsense? ", " >>180701Well, if you don't remember, this is the same Russian Oligarch that paid Manafort 10 million dollars a year for at least three years in the mid 2000's to form and implement a plan to \"\u201cgreatly benefit the Putin Government\u201d.>\u201cWe are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,\u201d Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, \u201cwill be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.\u201d...>Manafort told Deripaska in 2005 that he was pushing policies as part of his work in Ukraine \u201cat the highest levels of the U.S. government \u2014 the White House, Capitol Hill and the State Department,\u201d according to the documents. He also said he had hired a \u201cleading international law firm with close ties to President Bush to support our client\u2019s interests,\u201d but he did not identify the firm. Manafort also said he was employing unidentified legal experts for the effort at leading universities and think tanks, including Duke University, New York University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.>Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place....>In strategy memos, Manafort proposed that Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine. He proposed building \u201clong term relationships\u201d with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region.https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a ", " >>180830>Manafort\u2019s work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court. The billionaire gave Manafort nearly $19 million to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska\u2019s representatives. It said that after taking the money, Manafort and his associates stopped responding to Deripaska\u2019s queries about how the funds had been used.>Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska\u2019s representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the nomination, Deripaska\u2019s representatives said they would no longer discuss the case.So again, to reiterate, Trump's campaign manager was secretly working to advance the interests of the Russian government and he also owed Russian oligarchs millions of dollars at the time he went to work for Trump. Once Trump got the nomination with Manafort's help they dropped a lawsuit against him. Since then it's been discovered he offered them private briefings on the campaign. Don't forget that the Russians also interfered in this election with an expensive and wide scale propaganda campaign on western traditional and social media. They committed crimes of cyber espionage by breaking into the democrat's systems. They hacked into the election infrastructure in 21 states, they made hundreds of thousands of twitter bots all in an attempt to get Trump elected. They invested a large amount of resources into getting Trump elected and they had leverage over and a longtime working relationship with Trump's campaign manager.

They say they shouldn\u2019t be grouped together as criminals because of a few bad actors.Scott \u201cScottie D\u201d Donihoo, who runs a Juggalo fan site called \u201cFaygo Luvers,\" said ICP fans are just misunderstood.\u201cWe don\u2019t conform to anybody\u2019s rules or regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we dangerous? No. Not by any means.\u201d Are there Juggalos that are gang members? Probably, Donihoo admits. But he argues that there are Willie Nelson fans who are gang members, too.The two members of ICP \u2013 Joseph Bruce, known as Violent J, and Joseph Utsler, known as Shaggy 2 Dope \u2013 have fought the designation with four fans in Michigan courts, where the band is based, since 2014. The case is now on its second appeal before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, following previous dismissals by a lower district court. Arguments are scheduled for Oct. 11. ICP and its fans argue in court briefs that the FBI has violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The Department of Justice, however, argues that the report has no direct legal effect on ICP fans.The FBI said in a statement to The Hill that the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment was comprised of information shared with the National Gang Intelligence Center and the FBI from law enforcement agencies around the country.\u201cThe 2011 report specifically noted that the Juggalos had been recognized as a gang in only four states,\u201d the spokesperson said.

But Webber said the two events are separate and will remain that way.\u201cThey have their allotted space, we have ours,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can express their First Amendment privilege and we can express ours.\u201dSome liberals have seen Juggalos, who traditionally come from blue-collar backgrounds, as potential political allies.

The best comparison would be if the FBI labeled all bikers as a gang because of the shared culture 1 percenters have with the rest of normal bikers. Clearly, that is highly unfair to the majority of law-abiding bikers. Being associated with gang activities can have a serious impact on someone's life professionally, giving legitimacy to the grievances of protesting Juggalos.

Before leaving office, President Barack Obama sought to toughen those national rules, to bring them more in line with those in communities like Seabrook. President Donald Trump, however, revoked Obama's executive order last month.Harvey, which has displaced around a million people and flooded swaths of Houston, has proven an early test of that decision. Floodplain experts wrote to Trump this week, urging him to rethink his reversal of Obama's order.\"As we come to the conclusion of Harvey, we have suffered some damage to our community, but not to the extent that some of our neighboring communities have. That is partly because of our (elevation) requirement,\u201d said Seabrook deputy city manager, Sean Landis.Although Obama\u2019s order had not yet come into effect when Trump rescinded it, some communities had been concerned about the cost of elevating existing buildings to comply with the new rules. But Landis said more stringent rules have paid off in Seabrook. \u201cWe feel more resilient,\u201d he said.Seabrook's experience illustrates how some American coastal municipalities, fearing more intense storms and rising seas, have gone beyond federal standards for building in flood-prone areas. Those federal rules largely have not changed since the 1970s, when there was less evidence of the effects of global warming.http://www.businessinsider.com/hurricane-harvey-trump-building-regulations-obama-2017-9 "}, "replies": [" In Texas and Louisiana, for instance, communities comprising two-thirds of the nearly 8 million people affected by Harvey have updated their flood protection standards beyond federal requirements since 1990, as part of a federal program that in return discounts their flood insurance, according to a Reuters review of municipal codes.Trump rescinded the Obama standard as part of an executive order aimed at speeding up the permitting process for federally funded infrastructure. It was the latest in a series of moves by Trump to repeal Obama-era rules aimed at girding the United States against climate change, which Trump has described as a hoax by the Chinese government.Public assistance grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency currently require structures to be built at or above the \u201c100-year\u201d flood elevation: the level that waters would reach in a flood that had a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.\"Rebuild Houston Smarter\"In its Aug. 29 letter to Trump urging him to rethink his decision, the Association of State Floodplain Managers called on the president to \"rebuild Houston smarter.\"Chad Berginnis, the association's executive director, noted that federal funding for rebuilding of communities hit by Hurricane Sandy in 2013 came with strings attached - new structures had to be elevated a foot (31 cm) higher than the normal federal standard.\"Thousands of structures have been rebuilt under that standard, and we haven't heard any complaints at all in terms of it being something difficult or impossible to do,\" Berginnis said.When asked whether the administration might require post-Harvey disaster relief recipients to use the Obama-era standards when rebuilding, Roy Wright, the director of FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, said, \"That is a conversation for another day ... I'm sure informed decisions will be made.\" ", " Obama\u2019s order would have required federally funded structures to be built at one of three elevations: the level that waters would reach in a flood that had a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in a year, 2 to 3 feet above the federal requirement, or at a level to be devised based on climate science projections.The city of Seabrook in 2008 raised its standard to one foot above federal levels, according to municipal records. Last November, the city council voted to raise it 6 inches higher than that.Seabrook\u2019s former mayor, Jack Fryday, now works as a city building official for Taylor Lake Village, another community near Seabrook in the Galveston bay area, where he said the elevation requirement is 3 feet above the federal level.After Hurricane Ike struck the area in 2008, most people who lived along Taylor Lake raised their buildings, except for a handful of houses, according to Fryday. \u201cThose five or six that hadn\u2019t elevated are the ones that got water in their houses during Harvey,\u201d Fryday said.Higher StandardsWhen Obama first issued his executive order, it drew fierce criticism from the National Association of Homebuilders, a housing trade group. The new standards had a \"chilling effect\" on builders because they would have raised the costs of any building using federal mortgage insurance, according to the association's chief executive officer, Jerry Howard.\"The rules, as they were put out for comment, were overly intrusive,\" he said.In some of the areas hardest hit by Harvey, however, local officials say the increased upfront costs save them far more in rebuilding costs after a major flood event.In 2002, the year after Hurricane Allison ravaged much of the Gulf coast, Texas\u2019s most populous county, Harris, adopted new requirements that regular buildings be built 18 inches higher than federal elevation requirements. ", " Critical facilities \u2013 such as police departments, schools, and fire stations \u2013 must be 3 feet higher. Houston is in Harris County, but the city\u2019s elevation requirements are slightly lower than the county\u2019s rules, which apply to Harris County communities that do not have their own city governments.\"We have much higher standards than the feds,\" said John Blount, the county engineer for Harris County, as Harvey raged outside his office.Blount said he had not closely studied Obama's executive order before it was revoked, but he thought it looked more like a bureaucrat's wish-list than an actual flood management standard - in part because it had not yet been turned into policy.\u201cObviously we\u2019re not concerned about having stronger regulations, because we have some of the strongest in the country. Some of the provisions in the (Obama) act made sense, but it also had a lot of fluff,\u201d he said.Building officials for communities that have not raised elevation requirements beyond the federal level were harder to reach during Harvey's rampage across southeastern Texas, but Galveston County engineer Michael Shannon answered Reuters' questions by email.The county had not recently considered adopting a higher standard, he wrote in a brief message. \"As flood levels are rising at my home, I may be evacuating today,\" he added.(Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin) ", " >\"As we come to the conclusion of Harvey, we have suffered some damage to our community, but not to the extent that some of our neighboring communities have.

Deal with it.\u201dPutin\u2019s Rejection>Top Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly rejected accusations the country meddled in the U.S. election, a finding at odds with the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community. In January, the nation\u2019s top intelligence agencies agreed that Russia interfered in the election to discredit Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, who has often appeared reluctant to embrace the findings. Trump\u2019s intelligence chiefs, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, have agreed with the conclusions.>Putin told NBC News in June that there\u2019s \u201cno proof\u201d of any involvement by Russia at the \u201cstate level.\u201d But he did say that \u201cpatriotically minded\u201d Russians could have been behind intrusions into Clinton\u2019s campaign.>The drumbeat of news about Russia\u2019s role in the election have only helped push relations with the U.S. to post-Cold War lows. Nonetheless, analysts say Russia\u2019s longer-term goal is less focused on Trump than on helping disrupt or undermine U.S. democratic institutions -- an effort that has been under way for decades but which now has a more technological edge.>Researchers say Twitter isn\u2019t the only domain for bots. They\u2019re increasingly expanding to other platforms like YouTube, Instagram and LinkedIn. They even operate interactive \u201cchatbots\u201d on mobile applications available on Facebook, said Nitin Agarwal, an information science professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ", " Mimicking Human Behavior>\u201cThe level of sophistication among these bots is increasing and becoming more and more advanced to try to evade bot detection and suspension from Twitter and other platforms,\u201d said Agarwal, who\u2019s spent a decade studying the use of social media for influence operations. They\u2019re also trying to \u201cmimic human behavior so that they can gain your trust and they can influence your behaviors,\u201d he said.>Because the use of bots is still new, trying to understand how they operate has become a cutting-edge field. It\u2019s even caught the attention of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA.>In May, the agency awarded Agarwal and Intelligent Automation Inc., a Rockville, Maryland-based technology company, a contract of up to $1.5 million over three years -- if research milestones are met -- to study the classification of \u201csocial bots,\u201d what their intent is and how they\u2019re applied on social media.>For researchers, Twitter is a data gold mine because users\u2019 accounts are usually publicly available. It\u2019s harder to access private content on Facebook.\u2018Powerful Antidote\u2019>When asked how it was responding to growing sophistication by bots, a Twitter spokeswoman referred to a June 14 blog post by Colin Crowell, the company\u2019s vice president of public policy, government and corporate philanthropy. Crowell outlined how Twitter is curbing \u201cbots and other networks of manipulation,\u201d including growing its team and resources and working \u201chard to detect spammy behaviors.\u201d>\u201cTwitter\u2019s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information,\u201d Crowell wrote. \u201cThis is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not. We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.\u201d ", " >Since the election, Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to counter false news and kill off fake accounts. In August, Facebook said it created a software algorithm to flag stories that may be suspicious and send them to third-party fact checkers. But bots are also getting savvier at dodging detection. That poses a challenge to social media companies trying to crack down on fake accounts -- and fake news.>And with bot activity accelerating as the U.S. heads into another election season in 2018, social media companies could face further risks from these networks.>A challenge for social media companies is \u201chow good their algorithms are at weeding out bot strikes,\u201d Nimmo said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that they need to be thinking of.\u201d ", " >>177219>Beep boop pro-Russia beep ", " >everyone that disagrees with master flip-flopper and everyone's favourite hypocrite McCain is a Russian bot ", " >>177233not everyone, but bots are very commonrepublicans and hillary used bots too but nothing nearly on the scale or sophistication as thisthey prefer to support fascists and disastrous politicians and it shouldn't be surprising, Russians don't care too much for American power and aren't shy about taking whatever advantage they can get away with, in eastern europe or the US.

The vast majority of these (76 percent) were foiled plots, meaning no attack took place.>During the same period, we found that right-wing extremists were behind nearly twice as many incidents: 115. Just over a third of these incidents (35 percent) were foiled plots. The majority were acts of terrorist violence that involved deaths, injuries or damaged property.>Right-wing extremist terrorism was more often deadly: Nearly a third of incidents involved fatalities, for a total of 79 deaths, while 13 percent of Islamist cases caused fatalities. (The total deaths associated with Islamist incidents were higher, however, reaching 90, largely due to the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas.)>Incidents related to left-wing ideologies, including ecoterrorism and animal rights, were comparatively rare, with 19 incidents causing seven fatalities \u2013 making the shooting attack on Republican members of Congress earlier this month somewhat of an anomaly.>Nearly half (48 percent) of Islamist incidents in our database were sting operations, more than four times the rate for far-right (12 percent) or far-left (10.5 percent) incidents.https://www.revealnews.org/article/home-is-where-the-hate-is/OP's propaganda piece cites an anecdote and suggests that just because assaults aren't typically reported in national news media, there is some bias.

The other question is, are you considering the ramping up speed of left wing terrorism in comparison to right wing terrorism being committed? Citing last years statistics do no do much when things have greatly escalated recently. Another question is what is and isn't considered left wing terrorism, currently antifa attacks are NOT considered to be any form of domestic terrorism despite filling the definition of it to a t.

", " >>174104>read very much like propaganda even in the more pro-liberal sectionsI don't think I'm contrary to you at all.And history textbooks, need not take sides. That's the problem. Downplaying atrocities, or outright not mentioning them even when they have causal relevance to events described, is revisionism. And it's just as revisionist as playing them up. But the board which was in charge of curating your education may not have seen that bias. Or maybe they did, and accepted it as a necessary evil as some whiggish bid for generational progress. Still propaganda. And there is a plurality of propaganda in that a conservative state will elect a conservative board to curate a conservative education. To the point of even challenging secularism.Observing historical accounts, and actually interpreting them, are two very different things in big boy academics. But for some reason, the foundation of a child's education in history is made up of the interpretation fed to them by somebody else. There's a distinct lack of trust here, and an even more insidious insecurity at play: If you're not careful, the little fuck might end up believing in something other than the \"correct(tm)\" answer. Which even in liberal circles is a completely and totally conservative notion. Their education amounts to absorbing loaded answers for loaded questions, taking cues every step of the way. And it's not until late high school and college preparation, that they're even judged on their ability to coherently make interpretations of their own.And what we find is that american kids lag behind the world. They approach this academic coming of age at the mercy of the individual teacher. Because education as federally mandated will only teach a child how to take cues from others, and fit them neatly into questions that limit the range of thought. Is it really any wonder that Americans are so clannish? ", " >>174134>>174128Here's something I find myself agreeing with a lot of small-government conservatives on: A federal institution has no place in the moral education of a child. That's a horrifying notion for reasons any person should be able to see. But in order to express it with any semblance of honesty, you have to acknowledge that this isn't a matter of who to scapegoat. I see it as a matter of acknowledging deeply human insecurities that hold back a system intended to combat human ignorance. Why are children taught morality, instead of the ability to evaluate morality? The later stages of institutional education are monopolized by liberals, and thus some coming of age into liberalism. And the earlier stages are capitalized on by family-focused conservatives that mask their own interpretation of history as more universal values that every child should know. And both represent that same insecurity. If a child is allowed to grow into an adult without being taught these basic mores, we let a monster on society. Neither have -anything- novel to say about this though. Look at the basic implications behind any of this clannish bickering: >You are naive. >You don't see the world for what it is. >You choose not to. >You are infantile by choice. >You have no right to make these decisions. The rhetoric is the same across the board. >Your education is incomplete, because you hadn't considered what I've considered. But in all likelihood, I've never bothered to fully consider it in the way that you are, now. ", " >Antifa is now the face of the leftYeah no, it wasn't 30,000+ members of antifa that marched through Boston two weeks ago. Meanwhile nazis and white nationalist actually are the poster child for the alt right, and the majority of Americans now see that movement as murderious because of the terrorist attack in Charlottesville. ", " >>174142To back up your point, antifa mostly shat on any leftists to the right of them before trump came up. Tools of the state. Look at the blogs. They're full of contempt for moderate leftism.White nationalists want to work through the government. They want wider societal approval to get more guys like Trump in the government. And they want to be the poster child of the alt-right, because it gives them more political access to right-wing voting coalitions.Half of antifa doesn't even fuckin believe in voting. ", " >>174139>Why are children taught morality, instead of the ability to evaluate morality?this is unfortunately an un-resolvable problem and has been since the dawn of man. children do not pop out of the womb with fully developed reasoning skills- indeed the average human probably has much room to grow in this regard no matter how old they are. when billy feels like punching sally in the jaw for no reason, there is no way to take billy aside and instruct him in some incredibly sophisticated moral reasoning scheme that would make him believe that hitting sally is wrong- more than likely he is too selfish, undeveloped and unexperienced to be able to comprehend anything you would attempt to teach. the only real answer is the threat of punishment, at least until he reaches a double-digit age where he will begin developing a more nuanced view of the world. ", " >>174146That's hard to argue with. But in the same form, adults don't suddenly level up and get skillpoints to put into critical thinking when they turn 18, 21, or 25. My parents tried to me -why- I did shit like that.\"She got in the way of my hand!\">That's ridiculous.\"She made me mad!\">that's your excuse?\"She was asking for it!\">I thought she only made you mad\"Well I thought-\">Did you think?Was the sort of exchange that'd happen. And being 5, you're right, I couldn't really evaluate this exchange afterwards. I was selfish and wanted to avoid punishment more than I wanted to understand why it was wrong. But my parents knew that the threat of punishment could move me to actually think about what I'd done.. And they gave me adult answers, in the short form of sophisticated moral reasoning. But I was underdeveloped. Without impulse control, the threat of punishment was often a non-issue to me.It only bore fruit 2 years later. Because it'd happened a lot and became this sort of ritual between us. I lost my temper with two kids on the playground. We were playing. But they hit me with a stick just a smidge too hard and I just goddamn lost it. I chased them halfway across the field. And while running, I remember something outside my focus playing out that ritual in my head. That thing knew I didn't want to hurt them. But I did want the gratification of it. They hurt me. I was mad. But in recent memory was a teacher saying being mad or sad were two sides of a coin. So I stopped and just let myself feel sad instead. It looked like we were playing the whole time. But if I caught them to start a fight, that would have been trouble. That's the first time I can remember using moral reasoning to avoid that situation. I don't know if I'd even thought of punishment at the time.It'd be arrogant to say that I could have done that without my parents' ritual, or my teacher's advice. The lesson, practice, and punishment were all necessary to make that choice. ", " >>174146>>174155But that was an individual teacher that told me the coin thing. It wasn't a part of the district mandated school curriculum that textbooks are. It was her genuinely trying to impart a few of these short-form moral reasoning to be used later. She probably knew kids might only superficially grasp that. But it's about planting seeds, much in the same way that a politicized curriculum plants its own seeds. And I'd later realized this ritual was punishment. I'd groan at the thought of having to perform that for somebody whenever in trouble. So that was the incentive to start doing it first. So it's not as if punishment and the process of critical thought have to be separate concepts. Won't arbitrary punishment lead to arbitrary morality? And isn't that the same process by which politicized curriculum produces politicized beliefs?I don't think it's an uncommon punishment. Nor is it one that assumes children are more capable than they are. But it is one that assumes through repetition, a child will eventually start having these conversations with themselves. And that in imagining a response for lack of mentor counterpart, they'll need to conceptualize and juxtapose another belief system with their own. And the challenges that they assign to that mentor, will be imitations of the challenges mentors have given them in the past. That is, until they develop enough to not need the direct comparison, and start abstracting more complex challenges. So as a person gets better with complex abstractions as they develop, this becomes a valuable cognitive tool. ", " >>174160>>174155Really enlightening posts. It's indeed far better to socialise people by teaching moral reasoning and nurturing a rational mindset, not harsh and arbitrary punishments conditioning them to believe authority decides morality. Extending the argument from children to adults, specifically convicts, how can one argue in good faith that the death penalty for murder is just, assuming all human life has equal value, thus leaving state sponsorship as the sole distinction?

Is it because the media didn't headline it as 'Violent Nigger Terrorist Murders Whites', objectivity and accuracy be damned? >>174298>Islamist terrorism is preplannedThat brings me to my second point; terrorism is tricky to define, because while the basic definition is the 'use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims', it's often tricky to determine the exact motives in each individual case, the attackers are often unaffiliated with terrorist organisations (thus not meeting the standards for 'international terrorism'), and 'domestic terrorism' doesn't exist as an actual charge. Thus, the Florida Nightclub shooter can't be charged because he wasn't actually ISIS, nor was there any clear motive other than blind rage. The Charlottesville driver, Dylann Roof, Micah Johnson, and Gavin Long can't be charged either because even if you could unambiguously prove premeditated terrorist intent, you can only charge them with hate crimes, not a nonexistent crime. Therefore, the truth doesn't play favorites. If black police shooters and Muslim spree killers are 'terrorists', then so are White Nationalist killers.

And with a smaller economy, we have a smaller pie to divide up.At the other extreme of no government intervention, quality of life still suffers because of a less stable economy, less ability for government to provide protections for the poor or environment, and meritocracy can suffer because the poor are more liable to get stuck in generational cycles of poverty.That is why most modern economies try to achieve an optimal balance in the continuum between extremes of night-watchman state and communism.

If you tax a rich guy 1$ and give it to a starving guy, in some sense you increase net freedom because generally speaking, each additional dollar one has when one is in poverty tends to accomplish more in terms of producing additional opportunities in the immediate future than an extra dollar earned when one is rich.Obviously it's more complicated than that because if the government just redistributes everything until everyone enjoys the same quality of life, we lose profit incentive and with that the macroeconomic benefits of a market economy, and often the only remaining motivator of economic activity is government force. And with a smaller economy, we have a smaller pie to divide up and we are less capable of holding our own in international competition.At the other extreme of no government intervention, quality of life still suffers because of a less stable economy, less ability for government to provide protections for the poor or environment, and meritocracy can suffer because the poor are more liable to get stuck in generational cycles of poverty.That is why most modern economies try to achieve an optimal balance in the continuum between extremes of night-watchman state and communism.

Hopefully that means that they'll enact actual positive change like giving collective bargaining back its strength rather than artificially jacking up minimum wages, but I doubt it. Likely they'll storm back into control of congress and the presidency only to have a mediocre positive effect on the country to lose out to the Republicans again.

A person close to Mr. Bannon insisted the parting of ways was his idea, and that he had submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, to be announced at the start of this week, but it was delayed in the wake of the racial unrest in Charlottesville, Va.Mr. Bannon had clashed for months with other senior West Wing advisers and members of the president\u2019s family.But the loss of Mr. Bannon, the right-wing nationalist who helped propel some of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises into policy reality, raises the potential for the president to face criticism from the conservative news media base that supported him over the past year.Mr. Bannon\u2019s many critics bore down after the violence in Charlottesville.

FDR got butthurt about how the supreme Court was blocking some of his legislation. To solve this he explored the idea of padding the court with more judges of his own choosing. FDR was popular, so do you think the effort was supported? It wasn't and FDR faced an appropriate backlash for trying to overreach his constitutional limits. Now the military heavily supports Trump, but do they support him enough to betray the fundamental nature of the Constitution and to install a police state over an unwilling populace?

For instance, here it was used on mostly developed sheep fetuses, which have different needs from early development embryos. If the fetus has to be removed at such a late stage, this once again brings in the dangers of childbirth (as well as the troubles with pregnancy) since a late term transfer like this would be far more dangerous. Most abortions are preformed in the early stages of pregnancy (which is less of an extraction and more like simulating a miscarriage), where there is minimal risk (especially compared to childbirth), so unless this procedure is considered viable at that early stage abortion will still continue to exist.>>163202Rape is still a thing.

Mueller III departed the home with various records. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, confirmed that agents executed a warrant at one of the political consultant\u2019s homes and that Manafort cooperated with the search.Manafort has been voluntarily producing documents to congressional committees investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. The search warrant indicates investigators may have argued to a federal judge they had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a grand jury subpoena.It could also have been intended to send a message to President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman that he should not expect gentle treatment or legal courtesies from Mueller\u2019s team.The documents included materials Manafort had already provided to Congress, said people familiar with the search.\u201cIf the FBI wanted the documents, they could just ask [Manafort] and he would have turned them over,\u201d said one adviser close to the White House.Josh Stueve, spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment, as did Reginald Brown, an attorney for Manafort.

The White House attempted to brush the report aside Wednesday, but it quickly raised fresh alarms in Congress about Russian links to Trump associates.Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse.Manafort pitched the plans to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP.

Plus, with peace and prosperity reigning across the land, who wanted to yank the president out of office? The unthinkable became thinkable. That\u2019s what Trump needs. As Mueller and his fellow G-men close in on their quarry, the willful blindness of partisans won\u2019t be enough to keep Republicans from turning against Trump in numbers large enough to put his job at risk. But if there is a sense that removing or even further isolating the president could jeopardize a growing economy, folks will tend to get a lot more lenient in their thinking. That\u2019s why we revisit this thought experiment from time to time. If we imagine that all that has been said and accused is true, would enough Republicans care enough to want Trump out? Certainly the passing of time helps the president as voters get accustomed to a new reality that would have shocked them before. But also the condition of the country and its economy matters too.And since whatever is revealed will almost certainly fall short of the most hysterical claims of Trump\u2019s foes, it may not even take an economic boom to keep at least the overwhelming majority of Republicans on board. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/04/would-even-care-if-was-guilty.html ", " >>166692Anthony Weiner is literally in jail faggot.

Ok, let me explain it in retard for you. When they discovered the world's largest oil fields under their land they started making profit faster than the market could adjust. Because the oil was so abundant and expensive it drove the value of their currency up, then suddenly no one from outside of the country wanted to buy anything but oil. Exporting from Venezuela ground to a halt. Their agriculture and production industries died in a matter of a few years because businesses could get those products cheaper from nations who weren't rolling in money. Chavez took office in the 1990s on a platform advocating a path between capitalism and socialism. He restructured the government-owned oil company so that the profits would go into the Venezuelan state, not the pockets of Wall Street corporations. With the proceeds of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports, Chavez funded a huge apparatus of social programs. Big oil revenues enabled Chavez and the United Socialist Party to bring millions of Venezuelans out of poverty. Between 1995 and 2009, poverty and unemployment in Venezuela were both cut in half.Then it collapsed as more oil based economies pumped out more oil more efficiently trying to soak up as much money as they could before the bubble popped.This was largely due to Saudi Arabia and America agreeing to pump out as much oils as possible to destroy the economies of their enemies. When it popped, Venezuela sold oil for less and less every day until the oil glut was so bad that it was cheaper to buy oil from other nations than to pump it out of their own land. With all that once valuable money practically worthless, the people began to struggle. Then their dictator died and a nation wide drought struck.

The state is still developing a licensing system for growers even though legal retail sales of the drug will begin next year, and medical use has been allowed for decades.Ecologist Mourad Gabriel, who documents the issue for the Forest Service as well as other state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, estimates California's forests hold 41 times more solid fertilizers and 80 times more liquid pesticides than Forest Service investigators found in 2013.Growers use fertilizers and pesticides long restricted or banned in the United States, including carbofuran and zinc phosphide. In previous years, it was commonly sold fertilizers and pesticides that were used illegally, law enforcement officials said.Exposure to the pesticides has sent at least five law enforcement officials and two suspects to hospitals with skin rashes, respiratory problems and other symptoms, court documents and state data show.Use of any chemicals in national forests is against federal law, as pesticides have killed sensitive species and fertilizers can cause algae blooms and bacteria problems in rivers and streams.https://ca.news.yahoo.com/toxic-waste-u-pot-farms-alarms-experts-100944016.html "}, "replies": [" According to unpublished data seen by Reuters, Gabriel, who has visited more than 100 sites in California and is widely considered the top expert on toxics at marijuana farms, calculated that federal land in California contains 731,000 pounds of solid fertilizer, 491,000 ounces of concentrated liquid fertilizer and 200,000 ounces of toxic pesticides.If much of the pesticide and fertilizer were released into a single stream rather than scattered around the state in leaky containers, the volume would exceed the amount of chemicals spilled in 2014 into the Elk River in West Virginia, which left 300,000 residents without access to potable water.\"We're getting contamination over and over again at those locations,\" said Gabriel, as toxins move from unsafe containers into the soil and water.At sites that state officials said they had cleaned up completely, his team found 30-50 percent of the chemicals were still there.\"They are like superfund sites,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Escobar, whose Fresno office has filed numerous marijuana-related environmental damage cases. Superfund sites are those targeted by the U.S. government for hazardous waste cleanup because of the risk to human health or the environment.Federal prosecutors have also charged pot growers with environmental crimes in Alaska, Oregon and Washington.The most toxic sites cost as much as $100,000 to clean up, leaving taxpayers with a bill that could reach $100 million or more in California alone.\"These places aren't safe to go into,\" said state Assemblyman Jim Wood, who has pushed for cleanup funding.Use of toxics has grown over the past three to four years, and chemicals have been found at sites in Oregon and Washington as well, said Chris Boehm, the Forest Service's assistant director for enforcement and investigation. \"In the last couple years we've lost a lot of the ground we had picked up in eradicating and cleaning up the new sites we find.\" ", " The expense and danger of cleanup has created a backlog of 639 illegal marijuana farms awaiting restoration in California, according to U.S. Forest Service data compiled for Reuters. Each farm covers up to 50 acres.Gabriel said that figure understated the problem, and pointed out that toxics are used at thousands of illegal farms on private and tribal land. After a year or two, growers often abandon sites, leaving containers of chemicals so toxic a quarter-teaspoon could kill a bear.As California moves to license growers, officials plan to regulate the use of chemicals. But rules can only be enforced against those who cultivate pot legally.\"There are a lot of incentives for continuing to grow illegally,\" said Washington Fish and Wildlife Deputy Chief Mike Cenci, citing growers' distaste for taxes and red tape.\"We've got 4,000 illegal grows in our county,\" said Keith Groves, a supervisor of Trinity County in Northern California. \"I'll be happy if we can get 500 of them to become licensed.\" ", " Yes hispanic gangs be growing weed in national forests.

The so-called \u201cgender unicorn\u201d is raising concerns and sparking anger across more states as teachers involved in sex education adopt the mythical character, which was created by transgender activists to teach children as young as age five about sex and gender identity. Why does a child as young as five need to be exposed to this confusing material? This is still the question many are asking. http://www.trunews.com/article/gender-unicorn-parents-outragedThe Daily Caller reports that the creators call the gender unicorn an upgrade to the \"gender bread person\", by replacing the man with a sexually ambiguous mythical creature.

To do so, party leaders need to win over key holdouts like Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, and they are playing hardball.Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior, called Murkowski and her fellow Alaska senator Dan Sullivan yesterday to warn them that opposing the bill would mean punishment for Alaskans, according to Alaska Dispatch News. He promised to hold back development projects and efforts to exploit Alaska\u2019s natural resources, including fossil fuel deposits, on the vast expanse of federal land in the far northwestern state.Murkowski is one of a handful of Republicans who have voted against proposed health care overhauls because they cut Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor that plays an important rule in back-stopping the health care system in rural Alaska. Now, Trump\u2019s team wants her to choose between health care and jobs.\u201cI fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs, and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,\u201d Sullivan told the Alaska Dispatch News. \u201cI tried to push back on behalf of all Alaskans\u2026 We\u2019re facing some difficult times and there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for the policies that Secretary Zinke and the president have been talking about with regard to our economy.\u201dThose policies include plans to build a road through a wildlife refuge, expand oil drilling in protected lands, and appoint Alaskans to federal government positions where they can be influential in pushing for more access to federal lands.https://qz.com/1039841/donald-trumps-secretary-of-the-interior-ryan-zinke-threatens-to-protect-the-environment-if-alaska-senators-dont-back-health-care-bill/ "}, "replies": [" The irony is that Zinke and Trump have long called for action to exploit federal land that the Obama administration, which tended to prioritized environmental protection, denied.

The importance of oil to Alaska\u2019s economy, especially as the petroleum market struggles with low prices, means Murkowski is likely paying attention.Still, like many Trump team propositions, it\u2019s hard not to see this as a bluff.

When presented with these options, the government has a duty to take the choice that does not prolong suffering.I will agree that the government was far too slow to react to this at the beginning and it is probably largely their fault why this has all happened.

It was a bad situation for everyone, especially for Charlie and his parents but the judges and hospital were not being cruel. They were trying to prevent unnecessary suffering for Charlie. The US researchers were looking to test their treatment for use on people who could be saved.

Typical Republican bullshit, if you can't defend something Trump or his associates did, just point to something else and pretend its even close to the same! ", " >>157529Other than neither of them being against the law, no, they aren't equivalent. ", " >>157540I never said either was illegal. But Trump defenders have insisted both that this lawyer was not technically connected to the Russian government, and that there is no danger in meeting someone like her. So to turn around and pin her entrance directly on Loretta Lynch and the Obama DOJ, as if Democrats had some incentive to get her in, is implying that Democrats did something bad by approving the visa. That is very logically inconsistent though. You cannot simultaneously believe that she is not bad and therefore it was not bad for Trump Jr to meet with her, and that she is bad so the Obama DOJ should not have approved her visa. If you accept the implication that this article makes, that the lawyer was dangerous to our interests and should not have been admitted, then you must also accept that it would have been dangerous for Trump Jr. to meet with her. ", " >>157553I think they are implying this was a conspiracy to set up Trump. Kind of like the Steele dossier, which she supposedly has some connection with. ", " >>157557Yes but to believe that conspiracy is to believe even more logical inconsistencies. The conspiracy is based on the Steele dossier being tangentially connected to this lawyer through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. This firm was paid by Hillary supporters to create the dossier. This firm's connection to the lawyer comes through both being involved in the legal defense of the Russian company Prevezon. Fusion GPS has also been accused of attempting to stop the passage of the Magnitsky Act, a cause of this lawyer as well. This begs the question, if the legitimacy of the Steele dossier depends on the perception of Russia as bad, then why is Fusion GPS also working on removing the Magnitsky Act, which paints Russia as bad? Its seems as if they are working towards whatever they can get paid for. And their connection with the lawyer stems from the pro-Russia side which makes it hard to see how she would be connected with the Steele dossier. It also shows why a conspiracy with the Democrat administration, especially through this lawyer, would be absurd. The lawyer has clearly lobbied pro-Russia stances in the U.S. including against the Magnitsky Act (as stated in this thread's article), and Fusion GPS has worked against the Magnitsky Act as well. A) Why would the Obama administration collude with a person/group who are working hard against their own legislation? B) Why would the lawyer/Fusion GPS collude against the side, Trump, who would be far more friendly to their cause of removing the Magnitsky Act and friendlier Russian ties in general? There is no incentive to conspire against Trump for these people, but every incentive to help him. ", " >>157573It's not a logical inconsitancy to note that these \"bipartisan\" judges and lawyers all seem to be very close with the same political entities who have a bone to pick with the Trump administration, and they seem to always be tight to the same organizations and people ", " >>157573You are viewing this too narrowly. It is not necessary to simultaneously believe she is a threat and that she is harmless. People have already taken sides in the story and are unwilling to change their minds. There are those who argue she is a threat to democracy and that Don Jr. meeting with her is a treasonous act. By writing a piece about how she was allowed to enter the country only through intervention by top Democrats, it puts Democrats in a tough spot to claim she was a known threat. It need not reflect the views of the author on the issue. ", " >>157582You are correct that it is not necessary to have simultaneous conflicting beliefs for the author of this article. I posted that inconsistencies were necessary for \"Trump defenders\" who would defend Jr.'s innocence while simultaneously using this news to discredit Democrats. If she was known as bad then they're both in the wrong, if she was no threat then her status has no relevance. The main implication should be that the Democrats' approval of her visa doesn't matter very much when you consider the reasons for approving a visa and the reasons for taking a meeting are wildly different. >>157581Its pretty bad logic to just assume these groups have a bone to pick with the Trump administration, especially when elements of these groups (like the lawyer or Fusion GPS) are actively working against legislation that the Obama administration supported and the Trump administration would be more friendly towards. Not everybody is \"deep state\", there are many people who would benefit by taking on the deep state, especially people like this lawyer who advance Russian interests. ", " >>157590It really depends on why people are holding this article up as a way to discredit Democrats. The idea is that if she were truly a threat, as the current narrative claims, then she should have not been granted access after being denied a visa. This creates a situation where the Democrats have to either admit that they fucked up letting her in or that she was not a threat. It does not mean that the \"trump defender\" believes that she is a threat, but instead that they believe the Democrats believe she was and are therefore using it as a way to put them between a rock and a hard place. ", " >>157592No offense, but the Democrats don't have much credibility in the Russia department after the last few months ", " >>157590\"Deep state\" is made to sound ominous. In this case just means people working in the public sector with a security clearance and conscience that don't trust their superiors with information regarding abuse of authority.I get why confidentiality is important, but convictions do end up being made, that basically vindicates these people because given the number of major demonstrable lies that have been told, it seems more than likely this administration and the legislature would have done their best to sweep that information under the rug. ", " >>157592Why should she not be let into the country if it were suspected she worked with russian intel?This \"bad guy -> keep out of the country\" logic is too simplistic. I can imagine circumstances where our own intel would benefit from allowing someone like her into the country. ", " >>157620Because Loretta Lynch and John McCain are friends with her, she works with the same firm who pulled that stupid pissdossier out while McCain waved his arms around about it. Her Visa expires, she's denied reentry - but is given special privledge by lynch herself ", " >>157623Which wouldn't be surprising at all.Russians don't send intelligence agents to the US to broadcast their desire to undermine the US.They recruit otherwise unsuspect go-betweens in order to maintain plausible deniability.American intelligence might have figured she was a suspicious character and had an interest in keeping a close eye on her or they had no indication she was suspicious at the time and our government was fooled into allowing her entry through her relations within the US. ", " >>157623>she works with the same firm who pulled that stupid pissdossierthe pissdossier was obviously effective in giving trump an excuse to rage about the media, so at this point if it was fake, it looks like a false-flag designed to help trump's team cover their tracks or at least plant some doubt into the minds of those hearing the news. ", " >>157626Really? You can't admit that people on the other side might have made it to slander him? It must be a false flag? You people are tiring. ", " >>157620You are giving too much credit to the average American. Simplistic logic tends to be as far as they get now a days. ", " >>157627It's conceivable certainly not beyond reasonable doubt. My point is that many folks seem willing to give the russian government greater benefit of doubt than democratic politicians which seems ridiculous. ", " >>157627It's conceivable but certainly not beyond reasonable doubt the only conceivable explanation. My point is that many folks seem willing to give the russian government greater benefit of doubt than democratic politicians which seems ridiculous. ", " >>157637Probably because they are the only ones crowing about it, and the evidence is at best flimsy and needing critique/foundationAs if it means anything anyways. Short of \"hacking\", nothing the Russians or the Trump admins have been accused of is even Illegal - they're trying to paint Russia as the boogeyman of the modern world: guilty by association ", " >>157637Why would a dictator have to lie? ", " >>157645>nothing the Russianswe know they did hack. they attempted to hack voter rolls, they did hack both the dnc and rnc.And people in the Trump administration have lied under oath. There's also grounds to believe they sought to make a transaction that would amount to collusion with the hacking, which is conspiracy. ", " >>157660No you don't. All you have is \"all 17 intelligence agencies agree\" which is 1, bullshit, and 2 verbatim what they told us in Iraq regarding the WMDs. Give me one shred of solid proof. ", " >>157660>we know they did hackZero evidence ", " >>157329Which is unusual because the company had already retained a US firm, and such a renewal would not be granted unless Veselnitskaya were the only attorney representing them. ", " >>157660There is no publically available evidence pointing towards a Russian state actor as perpetrating the hack on the DNC. While I'm willing to believe the intelligence report, this is only under the assumption that they have evidence which is currently classified. ", " >>157700OK, I won't disagree with that.The idea that our intelligence agencies are in collusion with Democrats to blame Russia for the hacks is totally unsubstantiated, so the best evidence we have is that they're probably correct in their assessment Russia is responsible.I'm not a big fan of the FBI but there's so much circumstantial evidence of Trump's connections with the Russian mafia and by extension the Russian state. Taken with several administration staff having lied under oath, there's too much suspicious on their end not to give our intelligence agencies benefit of doubt. ", " >>157704>The best evidence we have is assuming the intelligence agencies aren't lying to usWell no dice then ", " not gettting any response from comments on youtube?, use incognito mode and see if youtube is censoring your comments ", " >>157715you're right that the intelligence agencies haven't released enough evidence for any conclusion to be definitive. However there has also been absolutely nothing to suggest that their assessment of Russian interference was made up. The proof would be in classified intel, and this intel being hidden is cast by Trump's side as somehow evidence of falsehoods, when in reality the important classified intel will be released more slowly than we'd like as the Mueller probe nears its end. Fact remains that there is no evidence of the intelligence community misleading on this topic, and no evidence that they are colluding with the Democrats to do so. Only hypotheticals. Contrast this with the fact that Trump's side has repeatedly lied and misled on this topic. It is easily seen where Sessions, Kushner, Trump Jr., and others, have lied about Russia and later been forced to change their stories. Not hypothetical lies, actual lies. So I think the best you can say is that neither side has been proven right yet, but when the Trump side has a track record of hiding information and the intelligence community side has only been suggested to do so, it is easy to see which side will have much more to hide when Mueller releases his findings. If you're depending on the liars to be truthful, you should be scared for that day. ", " >>157807>but when the Trump side has a track record of hiding information and the intelligence community side has only been suggested to do soThe IC does in fact have a track record of lying. >you're right that the intelligence agencies haven't released enough evidence for any conclusion to be definitiveIt's not on them to release evidence of collusion. They need to show that the alleged Russian hacking happened in the first place. Then we can move on to Trump's role in it. One thing at a time. ", " >>157807Also, if you look at any evidence available to the public involving Russian hacking, none of it really holds up. Just look into Guccifer 2.0 alone. There was a clear effort by someone in this election to disguise themselves as Russian. ", " >>157807The intelligence agencies has a laundry list of blatent lies they've told to not only the general public, but Congress and the SenateThis smells just like Hussain, Ghadafi, WMDs, and the rest. Power grabs and fake news ", " >>157688>what they told us in Iraq regarding the WMDsRead up on this subject, please.The justification for going to war was engineered from the Office of the Vice-President. After 9/11 Bush and Cheney saw an opportunity to deal to Iraq for a long standing animus.Pressure was placed on the intelligence agencies to provide favorable evidence for war and, in the end, the VP office cherry picked information that had been declared suspect, was unproven or wrong. Information that was then used to justify going to war.The blame rests far more with the WH than it does with the intelligence agencies. ", " >>157848In this particular case, the IC didn't even look into anything. They never examined the servers. And let's remember the Sony hack, which was less sensationalized in the political world than the DNC hack. Many people doubt the FBI's official claim that North Korea was the hacker, and for good reason. The DNC/Podesta hacks follow this exact same pattern. Right down to the FBI claiming \u201cthe need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information.\u201dI mean, they even claim that the Podesta hack is Russia, when we all know they actually have no evidence that could back that up. Podesta was phished, an incredibly low-tech method of obtaining log-in information. It's used in more than 95% of infiltration's. A 12 year old could learn to do it. But John Brennan will tell you this was a highly technical, highly coordinated operation. Even the DNC \"hack\" seems stupid. I still see no reason to believe it was actually hacked, rather than some individuals in the DNC being phished. What kind of email server hack only gives you access to 7 email accounts? And don't even get me started on Gucci2, that clear disinfo op. Maybe, MAYBE, it was a Russian disinfo op and they are just that exceedingly clever, but that seems like a fucking long shot to me. ", " >>157852Phished, and the malware used was well out of date. What even could hint at Russia in the first place is that the phishing attack went back out to a Russian IP. That's a pathetically weak level of evidence for then suggesting it was a state actor.I really want to believe the IC isn't just lying or retarded when they jump to this conclusion. But from what is publically known, this is the most explanation:>Moron gets phished by some script kiddie>Kiddie dumps to Wikileaks>DNC scrambles for excusesThe biggest counterargument I can think of to this position is the fact that the WH could bury this story by declassifying what exactly the IC knows about the attack. ", " >>157855The IP claim is incredibly weak. It's known they were using a VPN. Even worse, the IC's original claim that the VPN was private was debunked too. The company came forward, apologized for how it's services were used, and explained that they could be used by anyone. Literally ANYONE could have had that IP. For the IC to claim to know the hacker was Russian because he chose to use a Russian VPN is some of the most insane logic I can imagine. The balls the IC have to put that out there as evidence. And I'm not fully convinced that there was any malware sending anything back. Phishing attacks don't require malware. They only say that Guccifer 2.0 was sending data back to Russia, but that guy is suspect as FUCK. All evidence I've seen points to him being an American desperately pretending to be Russian. Probably CrowdStrike themselves. ", " >>157855And can Elite VPN even hit speeds near 200mbps consistently? That seems like something someone should look into. The files in the WikiLeaks batch transferred at around 23MB/s. ", " >>157855>The biggest counterargument I can think of to this position is the fact that the WH could bury this story by declassifying what exactly the IC knows about the attack.This is what gets me as well, because Trump is President he is receiving daily classified intelligence briefings and he can know any state secret he wishes....which means he should know for certain what the IC's position on whether Russia hacked us is. If this whole thing is made up then Trump would benefit by releasing as much info as possible. Instead he's giving ambiguous quotes like this: \"Well I think it was Russia and I think it could have been other people and other countries. It could have been a lot of people that interfered...Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure.\" So he thinks it was Russia but he's also not sure? Maybe you don't wanna believe the IC reports or Comey's testimony that it was certainly Russia. Republican Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a July 7 interview on MSNBC that the intelligence reports and briefings that he has received show \u201cvery clear and convincing evidence that it was a nation state attack by Russia.\u201dSo this Republican has no incentive to hurt Trump. But they're looking at the same intelligence and McCaul walks away certain it is Russia while Trump has no idea. If there was any room for doubt in the story Trump would benefit by exposing that. The fact is that he has not, and been shifty on his answers without providing any backing, which is incredible when you realize that he knows all the classified facts. Lets us be real here, we can put together a lot with publicly available info but nobody knows what is likely unless they've seen all the classified info. Out of all Americans who have it is only Trump who continues to be ambiguous about the cause, when he would benefit the most from certainty if he were innocent. Really makes you think. ", " >>157944I don't think it's that simple. I don't think the majority of these people would have the slightest goddamn clue of what they were looking at if they were shown evidence it was Russia. ", " >>157944>>157964Especially not Trump. No one ever accused him of being an expert on the cyber. ", " >>157964>>157971You both raise a good point. However there are people employed who attempt to simplify stuff like this for politicians. Of course details are lost in a simplification. But if the evidence was overwhelming and confusing then a Republican representative like McCaul has no reason to call it, \"very clear and convincing.\" I think also that Trump would not be relying just on the intelligence community to interpret the information. I would bet he has his own people who would understand it, combing through it in order to look for certainty or places to exploit. If they found something he could use I do believe he would be talking about it. But if we accept your premise that the majority of these people, especially Trump, would not understand the classified evidence, then maybe their statements on its contents don't matter. In that case the only statements that would matter would be those who do understand it, which would be the intelligence community....who have also unequivocally stated the hacks came from the Russian government. It is therefore amazing to me that some are more inclined to believe that the IC would be more likely to mislead on this, than someone like Trump who doesn't understand it. ", " >>157976Remember, all information they have actually comes from CrowdStrike, a private firm hired by the DNC. Maybe what's there IS clear and convincing, but maybe that's the point. Just look at Guccifer 2.0. The official stance by the US is that he is a Russian hacker, and all the evidence you can find points to it. But TOO MUCH evidence points to it, making it incredibly suspect that they actually are. IF Gucci2 is Russian, he went out of his way to make that obvious to everyone. Ignoring the second hack that \"set off alarm bells\", when it came solely to the leaks published by Assange, what is the evidence it was Russia? Do you think anyone knows or cares to separate the two as they should? ", " Why would the intelligence agencies know if they haven't even looked at the server that was hacked ", " >>157997Because the intelligence agencies are not on your team ", " >>157983>>157997One thing you are both doing is looking at the DNC hacks primarily. In the end though, hacking the DNC servers is nowhere near as concerning as an intrusion into voter registration computers that are connected by network to computers that count votes. It is true that CrowdStrike is the primary source of info on the DNC hacks and that the intelligence community has not seen the DNC servers. However you are both painting the DNC as the entire scope of Russia's potential cyber involvement when in reality it is nothing compared to attempting to tamper with votes. From what I understand about the DNC, their security was so shit that it is likely multiple groups were able to gain access. That means it would be nearly impossible to tie the leaks to any one group, so I agree with you there that the evidence is lacking. But that also means it is not necessarily a Democrat conspiracy that Guccifer 2.0 appeared so Russian, but also potentially a group wanting to avoid being traced and going with the obvious cover. It also means that both sides could possibly be right, that the Russians could have been among the groups hacking the server but not actually the ones who leaked the information to Assange. ", " >>158042>Intrusion in voter registrationProof please ", " >>158046You can read for yourself below. The proof to tie it all to Russia is still mostly classified but the proof that voting computers were compromised is pretty definitive and from a variety of sources. The DNC is a smokescreen compared to this shit. NSA document on Russian access to voter registration:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3766950-NSA-Report-on-Russia-Spearphishing.html#document/p1Bloomberg summarizing the attempts, including Illinois which had 90,000 voter registrations compromised:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/russian-breach-of-39-states-threatens-future-u-s-electionsAnd a new one from the WSJ just released today that reports South Carolina's Electoral Commission has concluded there were 150,000 attempts to penetrate voting systems on Election Day. And that is just a non-swing state. :https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-carolina-may-prove-a-microcosm-of-u-s-election-hacking-efforts-1500202806?mod=e2twp ", " >>158220There were also attempts by the federal government to hack into these systems as well.And Reality Winner, whose Facebook was full of anti-Government posts without any impact to her SC, leaking a document that just so happened to come by her desk, that paints a slight picture of what MAY have happened, without actually leaking any of the evidence to back it up, and who was caught immediately after the leak is all suspect as fuck. For all we know, the report concludes it was the Russians because of their other alleged actions in the election. ", " >>158235Nothing in your post addresses the legitimacy of my evidence. There is nothing unusual about the federal government conducting scans to test the security of voting systems. The controversy over it stems from dumb state-level officials resisting Obama's classification of voting systems as \"critical infrastructure\" because they saw it as some kind of federal power grab, when in reality it is an incredible weakness to have the cybersecurity of these systems distributed to 50 different groups that do not all have access to the latest security updates and intel that the federal level has. The conspiracy that Reality Winner is suspicious also has many holes. First of all, she is far from the first to have weird activity not impact her security clearance. Chelsea Manning was recommended to lose her clearance for violent outbursts before her leaks but did not. It is not so simple to take away someone's clearance once they have it, especially when you have so many employees to monitor. Also her social media posts were not anti-government but more specifically anti-Trump, giving a motive to why she would leak this. Reality Winner being caught quickly is also not a conspiracy but is very simple. The NSA did a quick scan of their employees personal email accounts and hers was the only one in contact with The Intercept. The conspiracy seems to be the \"documents happened to come by her desk\" but given that she faces jail time of 10 years, she has no incentive to send those documents in an obvious way. It was more likely just dumb. And of course the report she leaked would not contain all the classified evidence. She was just a contractor and would not have access to everything. All of the conspiracy surrounding her is just connecting unrelated stuff that has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the document.

All of those are independent events from a vast group of people over time that happened for varying reasons. You cannot prove how they connect to the Trump/Russia issue. Additionally most manipulation of information came from the administration of the time and not the agencies themselves. If you are going to use the phrase \"pattern of honesty\" then please look at the pattern by Trump's side on this case. The official line used to be they never met with a single Russian. Now their whole campaign has and yet you still defend their honesty on the topic, over the honesty of a group that has yet to lie on this topic. Makes sense.

But things get considerably trickier if instead of hiking shoes you put on a pair of 5-inch high heels, especially if you\u2019re a guy. But one English teenager recently proved that it\u2019s not impossible.Ben Conway, a 19-year-old art student from London, recently took up the challenge of hiking up to the top of the highest mountain in the UK in high-heel shoes, as a way to stand out in an application for a scholarship for the School of Communication Arts in Brixton. Applicants were asked to \u201cmake something passionate about something that they are passionate about,\u201d and since Ben loves drag culture and has been scouting for 13 years, he decided that marrying the two hobbies was a good idea.\u201cI needed to think of something difficult to do and I also love drag culture. I have also been scouting for 13 years and the challenge sort of married the two,\u201d Conway told The Scotsman. \u201cI picked Ben Nevis because it is the biggest. I thought if I\u2019m going to go for it, I\u2019m going to go for it properly. It was all a bit spontaneous.\u201dConway started his unusual high heel climb at 8 am, on June 27, and was joined by Callum MacKenzie Allen, a friend from his art foundation year, who videotaped the whole thing for a two-minute video that served as his application project. The whole climb took five hours and wasn\u2019t the smoothest experience.Halfway up Ben Navis, one of his shoe straps broke, so he had to tape the shoes to his feet to make sure they stayed on. The weather didn\u2019t make it easy for him either, as he claims that it rained pretty much the whole time, and he had to withstand 40 to 50 miles an hour winds. http://www.odditycentral.com/news/teenager-climbs-the-highest-mountain-in-britain-wearing-5-inch-heels.html "}, "replies": [" Due to these difficult conditions, Ben and his buddy had to turn back after reaching 900 meters up the mountain.

I\u2019ve hurt myself more on nights-out in London than wearing high heels up the mountain because I had socks and bandages on.\u201dApart from providing a unique art school application project, the high-heel climb also allowed the 19-year-old to raise some money for worthy causes, like the LGBT rights charity Stonewall, and Sal\u2019s Shoes, which provides footwear for barefoot children around the world.\u201cRaising money for charity brings happiness to people\u2019s lives and if I can do something ridiculous and bring someone happiness, then that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Ben said.

Hudek IV was charged Friday with one count of interference with flight crew members for allegedly assaulting two flight attendants on Delta Air Lines Flight 129. He is expected to remain in federal custody until a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.Hudek appeared for a hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Seattle, wearing a beige jail uniform and sporting a scrape or bruise below his right eye.He did not speak during the hearing.

However, he said he could not comment on whether Hudek is related to a Delta employee.About an hour into the flight, Hudek briefly went into the lavatory, according to the complaint.

The pilot notified the Federal Aviation Administration of the threat, and the flight carrying 210 passengers and 11 crew was diverted back to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.Meanwhile, Hudek allegedly punched one of the attendants twice in the face, hit a male passenger in the head with a red dessert-wine bottle and punched him several times.A flight attendant grabbed two wine bottles and hit Hudek with both, breaking one over his head.According to the criminal complaint, Hudek was undeterred by the impact of the 1-liter wine bottle and asked, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what Hudek meant by that.The male passenger then put him in a headlock, but Hudek freed himself as several other passengers from the first-class cabin jumped into the fight to restrain Hudek.

And her nomination could appease Trump\u2019s climate skeptic supporters, who have criticized EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for hesitating to revisit his agency's conclusion that global warming threatens public health.>Trump administration officials are divided over whether White is the best person for the job, and they are also considering other candidates to lead CEQ, sources said.

Any withdrawal of the finding would be challenged by environmentalists in court.>Pruitt has so far declined to reopen the endangerment finding, a decision that has infuriated some of Trump's conservative supporters.

In 2015, she argued that Obama's rules to limit carbon emissions from power plants marked \"an unprecedented expansion of federal administrative power\" with \"no measurable climate benefits.\u201d And last May, she urged House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a bill that would block EPA from regulating carbon dioxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons or other greenhouse gases.>At CEQ, White could direct other agencies to turn their attention away from climate change, and she would be in charge of implementing recent executive orders on energy development and regulatory streamlining. Last month, Trump ordered the council to revoke recently issued guidance directing all federal agencies to consider climate change when they conduct environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, a decision that would be difficult to challenge in court. And in January, the president told CEQ to come up with a plan to expedite environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects.>While environmentalists have long accused GOP officials of dragging their feet on climate change, White is by far the most outspoken critic of the underlying science \u2014 and the most ardent defender of fossil fuels \u2014 that Trump has considered to serve in his administration. ", " >In a 2014 blog post, White took aim at an article in The Nation by MSNBC host Chris Hayes, whose \"recommendation to avert global warming, like most warmist policies, toys with the greatest advance made by mankind,\" she wrote. In White's view, there is a connection between \u201cthe abolition of slavery and humanity's first widespread use of energy from fossil fuels.\u201d The rise of coal and oil, she argued, provided economic incentive to end the practice of slavery in the U.S. and elsewhere. (One critic fired back that the industrial revolution actually \u201cexacerbated\u201d slavery by increasing the demands for slave-produced goods such as cotton.)>Putting a permanent CEQ chair in place would also raise the question of where Trump wants decision-making on environmental issues to happen \u2014 in the White House or at agencies.>The Obama administration shifted major environmental responsibilities from CEQ to EPA and some other agencies as it sought aggressive action on climate change. It remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s CEQ will continue in that vein or have a greater role in policymaking, though outside Republicans have encouraged Trump aides to grant the council wide latitude.>The council was run from 2015 through the end of Obama's term by Christy Goldfuss, an unconfirmed managing director. Obama never nominated a replacement for his first CEQ chair, Nancy Sutley, who left in 2014.>White\u2019s criticisms of Obama environmental regulations go beyond climate change.

She previously sat on the Texas Water Development Board.>Environmentalists do give White some credit for advances made during her tenure at TCEQ.>Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, told POLITICO that she helped implement a legislative order to create an online reporting system for major emissions events, which is still used by green activists to track noncompliance by major energy companies. Metzger also credited her with a \"slightly improved\" enforcement policy, though he noted that she blocked an effort by a fellow TCEQ commissioner in 2006 to boost penalties.>In 2008, White joined the Texas Public Policy Foundation, where she directs its Armstrong Center for Energy & the Environment.

The two come into conflict all the time. Government employees quite frequently have limitations put on their actions as citizens, as sometimes the things a free citizen does could be involved in an abuse of power. For example, you could give me a laptop, since we're both private citizens. Were I a gov employee, that becomes a problem- it might be seen as a bribe or an attempt to induce favorable treatment. When you sign up to work for the government, you agree to abide by limitations on your behavior, as set by whatever group of laws your employment falls under. Federal employees in San Fran would have no such limitation, for example. It's LOCAL employees that have to abide by local laws about how they act.Local states can make laws on immigration, but it tends to be one of those conflict points.

People who get sick enough don't die, they live agonizing lives and generally can't work and survive off the taxpayer at emergency rooms.Our system was ridiculously arbitrary and cruel prior to the ACA. It didn't matter if it preventative care for a patient would have saved the taxpayer money and allowed the patient to remain a productive member of society and not live in suffering.This also made us less meritocratic since people often have to choose employers or whether to start a business not on the basis of where they best fit into our economy but on the basis of who offers what healthcare plan.>One of the reasons why the US is so successfulProsperity comes from lots of places. It also comes from having the peace of mind that health insurance actually works in case of catastrophe for the majority of Americans.People were once disincentivized from purchasing comprehensive and robust healthcare policies because if you fell sick enough, you were basically fucked if you ever had to change insurances or reached your coverage limits and you could always go to the emergency room for free anyway.This meant that fewer people opted for high premium comprehensive policies, which in turn concentrated the number of high risk individuals in those pools, further driving up premiums, in a vicious cycle until nobody had useful health insurance. The only way to break this cycle was for government to say, everyone has some risk and almost everyone uses healthcare if they need it, so if health insurance is going to be useful, everyone's got to buy into it before they become high risk.

Now there\u2019s video evidence suggesting that something is wrong with Trump, period, during this trip.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump held a joint press conference in Israel this week, with both men sitting in chairs. But at some point, with the questions still coming in, Trump simply got up and wandered off in lackadaisical fashion with a blank look on his face. Netanyahu tried to reach out to Trump with his arm twice, in what might have been an attempt to get him to remain for photos or a handshake.The media reacted in obsessive fashion when Hillary briefly appeared lightheaded during the campaign.

During the 9th edition of this joint military exercise, a defense will be simulated by the Russian high command to repel a mock invasion of Belarus by NATO.Historically the drill has involved a scenario where a full-scale conflict between the West and Russia has broken out, and previous iterations have even included simulated nuclear responses on European cities. Ahead of this drill, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, Commander of all U.S. Army units in Europe (USAEUR), announced Friday that an additional 600 troops will be deployed across the Baltic States for the duration of Zagad 2017, bringing the number of NATO forces currently in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland to approximately 5,100. Hodges told Reuters that the Pentagon is worried about possible Russian aggression during the Zapad exercise. \"When (Russia) went into Crimea, that was against the backdrop of an exercise. When they went into Georgia, that was an exercise\", Lt. Gen. Hodges said during a NATO exercise in Poland. \"Their history is full of examples where they don't live up to any treaties ... They routinely violate those things.\u201d \"We are all working hard to be at the highest levels of readiness during exercises like this,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. The exercise Lt. Gen.

It's similar to the US and China: sure we have our differences but there's be way too much to lose economically from a full blown shooting war (and we'd both die in nuclear fire). As such we instead spend our time waving flags and finding strange ways to annoy each other (Chinese artificial islands).This is not to say that the area isn't a hot spot: India and Pakistan are the only two nuclear nations to go to war with each other (thankfully, despite threats they never actually pushed the button).

It can be rebuilt, you know, they can\u2019t stop what we are trying to do. It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Villa said.Montes said when got the news the box had been damaged, he immediately dropped what he was doing, drove to the gym and put the box back together. While Montes said he hopes he doesn\u2019t have to do it again, he\u2019s ready for a rematch should there be one.\u201cHopefully they don\u2019t come back and do it again. If they do, I will fix it again,\u201d he said.The first blessing box was installed in Wichita\u2019s Riverside neighborhood in October of 2016.

She\u2019s also overseen an economic boom, with Swedish growth rates topping 4 percent early last year, that has turned budget deficits into surpluses.>In a world still flinching from the financial crisis that hit a decade ago and the populist wave that followed, Sweden\u2019s economic stewardship holds lessons that challenge the conventional wisdom in the U.S. on how taxes work, according to the Harvard-educated minister. Speaking in an interview in Stockholm, Andersson says success comes down to \u201cthree things: It\u2019s the jobs, it\u2019s our welfare and it\u2019s our redistribution.\u201dIt\u2019s the polar opposite of the policy being developed across the Atlantic, where U.S. President Donald Trump is hoping tax cuts, less regulation and new trade deals will produce 3 percent growth within two years. Meanwhile, in Europe, the Nordic model is attracting attention. Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday defeated Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, has urged his country to look north for ideas on how to organize a society.>Andersson, who lists health care and education, \u201cregardless of how much you earn,\u201d as key to running a successful economy, points to income redistribution as the shield that can keep populist shocks at bay.https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-07/a-reverse-trump-tax-plan-delivers-an-economic-miracle-in-sweden "}, "replies": [" Swedish Equality>The income of most Swedes has nearly doubled while that of most Americans has fallen:https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iqaMU7N5LvoE/v2/-1x-1.png>The numbers are compelling.

The EU average will be a shortfall of 1.6 percent in 2018, while the estimated deficit in the U.S. of 5.7 percent of GDP, EU Commission data published in February show.Debt Heaven>Sweden boasts one of the world's lowest public debt burdens:https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSxSsTtzUn6s/v3/-1x-1.png>The country also takes a pragmatic view of capitalism, which includes allowing businesses to fail if they can\u2019t compete. Part of this includes providing a safety net and training for workers, features that Andersson says are crucial to keeping a dangerous anti-globalization sentiment at bay.>\u201cIn Sweden, it\u2019s accepted that society changes and that some companies expand while others shrink, but that\u2019s based on the fact that there are bridges from the old to the new jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have security during that change, both in the form a well-functioning unemployment insurance, but also active labor market policies.\u201d ", " >But not all Swedes are persuaded that more tax increases will help. Andersson faces a vote of no confidence from the opposition if she presents further hikes. Meanwhile, parts of corporate Sweden are rebelling. There are also numerical signs that the tipping point may have been reached, as GDP slows.>Sweden\u2019s government has started tapping its surpluses to raise spending on everything from health care to education to defense and a stronger police presence. With an election looming next year, the Social Democratic-led administration is contending with its own right-wing nationalists, who have gained followers in the wake of record refugee inflows.>The center-right coalition that preceded the current government spent most of its eight years in power cutting taxes. They argue that Andersson and her boss, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, are now putting economic gains at risk, and warn that generous benefits discourage people from working. The opposition also notes that Sweden has fallen behind in wealth per capita since taxes were raised in the 1970s, culminating in an economic crisis in the early 1990s when taxes as a share of GDP exceeded 50 percent.>According to the website Ekonomifakta, which is run by Sweden\u2019s largest employer organization, the highest marginal tax rate has again crept up, reaching about 70 percent, including payroll taxes. With that in mind, the opposition is threatening a vote of no confidence against Andersson this autumn unless she withdraws her tax plan.>Banks and Sweden\u2019s private equity industry have railed against the tax environment, with Scandinavia\u2019s biggest financial group, Nordea Bank AB, threatening to leave. And a vibrant startup scene, led by music-streaming service Spotify Ltd., is calling for changes in how options-based income is taxed in an effort to attract more talent.>Andersson acknowledges there are limits, saying there\u2019s no need for \u201cbig\u201d tax increases in the coming years.

People in the US have a very \"every man for himself\" philosophy drilled into then from a young age, as evidenced by numerous posts in this very thread, which makes the idea of paying for someone else's care less appealing then a Scandinavian country.Another aspect is the smaller populations of other first world nations as well as the distribution of wealth being more even then what we see in the United States. Everyone actually would pay into the system, as opposed to here where the wealthy pay the majority of income tax making them less then willing to help others who would pay less for the same care.

Many of those systems weigh very heavily on the nation requiring far higher taxes then what we experience in the US at all income levels. You can make the argument that if you factor private insurance as a hidden tax it would balance out, and that is not an unfair point. Despite that, people are always more willing to pay a hidden as opposed to a blatant tax . Also you should look into the projected effects of the migrant crisis on European Healthcare systems.

Every insurance plan negotiates individually with hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical company to set prices. Insurers in the United States don\u2019t, as these charts show, get a bulk discount.

A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agency's complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month.The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerce's streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant.The report will analyze the submissions and \"will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,\" said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama.A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. "}, "replies": [" 3M Co said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained \"overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.\"The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPA's review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months.It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms.Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled.The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive.\"To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,\" said the National Roofing Contractors Association.Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. ", " But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books. \"We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,\" said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group. \"We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.\"Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort.Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries.The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and \"will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.\"Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs.\"This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose.

That relationship developed throughout 2016, months before Flynn was caught on an intercepted call in December speaking with Russia's ambassador in Washington, Sergey Kislyak.

His financial ties to Turkish government interests, which paid him $530,000 in a lobbying deal that he failed to disclose during the campaign, are also under scrutiny by federal investigators.>One major concern for Obama administration officials was the subject of conversations between Flynn and Kislyak that took place shortly after President Barack Obama slapped new sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election. Sources tell CNN that Flynn told Kislyak that the Trump administration would look favorably on a decision by Russia to hold off on retaliating with its own sanctions. The next day, Putin said he wouldn't retaliate.>Sources say Flynn also told Kislyak that the incoming Trump administration would revisit US sanctions on Russia once in office.

Trump urged then-FBI Director James Comey in February to drop the bureau's investigation into Flynn and \"let this go,\" according to a memo Comey wrote at the time. The conversation, first reported by The New York Times earlier this week, has opened the President up to charges from critics of obstruction of justice.>Trump's obvious bond with Flynn, like his relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other top advisers, appears rooted in the fact that they supported his then-longshot presidential campaign last year at a time when most Republicans were ostracizing him.

Conservatism is a war against intellectualism. The Conservatism spirit is will. It is not intellect. I hope I will not be misunderstood. Conservative intellectuals should not be intellectuals. Conservatism combats, and must combat, without respite or pity, not intelligence, but intellectualism--which is, as I have indicated, a sickness of the intellect--which is not the consequence of its abuse, because the intellect cannot be used too much. Rather it derives from the false belief that one can segregate oneself from life, to idle with systems of empty ideas, blind to the tragedy of human beings who work, love, suffer, and die. For those who understand, there is the place for intelligence--where there is drama, the struggle of man against mystery, the effort to control nature, and intensify life. One can understand that intelligence too is will.Conservatism understands that; it disdains culture that is only ornament and adornment. Conservatives seeks a culture in which the spirit is armed and reinforced in order to prevail in ever-new battles. That is, and must be, our barbarism--a barbarity of the intellectuals. It is a barbarism against science and, above all, against philosophy--but, let it be clearly understood, against liberal decadents, of the spineless, of those who forever remain at the window and content themselves with criticism as if life's struggle was not the affair!

But being a person of interest means investigators believe he may have information about the acts that are under investigation and he may therefore be subject to their scrutiny.>Sources who spoke to the Guardian said it was Farage\u2019s proximity to people at the heart of the investigation that was being examined as an element in their broader inquiry into how Russia may have worked with Trump campaign officials to influence the US election.... "}, "replies": [" >\u201cOne of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,\u201d one source said. \u201cIf you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage.>\u201cHe\u2019s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There\u2019s a lot of attention being paid to him.\u201d>The source mentioned Farage\u2019s links with Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s long-time political adviser who has admitted being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom US intelligence agencies believe to be a Kremlin agent.>Farage\u2019s spokesman said he had never worked with Russian officials, and described the Guardian\u2019s questions about Farage\u2019s activities as \u201cverging on the hysterical\u201d.>\u201cNigel has never been to Russia, let alone worked with their authorities,\u201d the spokesman said. But he did not respond to questions about whether Farage was aware of the FBI inquiry; had hired a lawyer in connection to the matter; or when Farage first met Trump.>The spokesman also declined to comment on whether Farage had received compensation from the Russian state-backed media group RT for his media appearances. RT, which has featured Farage about three times over the last 18 months, also declined to comment, citing confidentiality.>On Thursday Farage dismissed the story as \u201cfake news\u201d. He said he visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in March at the behest of LBC Radio \u201cwith a view to conducting an interview\u201d.... ", " >He added: \u201cI consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia.\u201d>Farage has said he only met Assange once has but declined to say how long the two have known each other.>The FBI\u2019s national press office said it had no comment on Farage.>The former Ukip leader has voiced his support for the Russian president, calling Vladimir Putin the leader he most admired, in a 2014 interview. Ukip also has history with Assange: Gerard Batten, a Ukip member of the European parliament (MEP), defended the Wikileaks founder in a speech in the European parliament in 2011.>One source familiar with the US investigation told the Guardian that the examination of Farage\u2019s activities was considered especially delicate given his role as an MEP.>Neither Farage nor Trump have made a secret of their admiration for one another. They emerged as unlikely winners last year in contests that have reshaped the world order: Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU and Trump\u2019s surprise ascendency to the White House.>Both men credited their ability to tap into the worries of struggling and neglected citizens for their victories. But at the heart of the US investigation lies a deeper question: whether Trump campaign officials and people close to the former reality TV star sought to work with state players in Russia to try to influence the US election result.>Last July, Farage attended the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, when Trump became the party\u2019s nominee. ... ", " >According to an account by the Ukip donor Arron Banks, Farage first met Trump at a campaign stop in Mississippi in August, where he spoke at a Trump campaign event.>But Farage\u2019s relationships with people close to the US president began years earlier. Farage first met Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s strategist and former campaign chief executive, in the summer of 2012, when Bannon, who was interested in rightwing movements in Europe, invited the then Ukip leader to spend a few days in New York and Washington, according to an account in the New Yorker magazine.>There Farage was introduced to, among others, the staff of the then senator Jeff Sessions, who is now the US attorney general. Speaking of his longtime admiration for Bannon, Farage told the New Yorker last year: \u201cI have got a very, very high regard for that man\u2019s brain.\u201d>Two years later, in 2014, Breitbart News, of which Bannon was executive chair, opened an office in London. A top editor, Raheem Kassam, later went on to work as Farage\u2019s chief of staff.>In 2015, Breitbart News arranged a dinner in Farage\u2019s honour at \u201cthe embassy\u201d, the nickname for the house the news group rented in Washington. According to a report in Bloomberg, attendees were \u201cblown away\u201d by Farage\u2019s speech at the event, which was also attended by Sessions.>Then, on 24 June last year, the day after the UK voted to leave the EU, Farage thanked Bannon during an interview for Breitbart News\u2019s coverage of the leave campaign. Bannon, in turn, congratulated Farage on his victory, saying he had led an extraordinary \u201cDavid v Goliath\u201d campaign.>Farage\u2019s ties to Stone are also under scrutiny, it is understood. Stone has frequently publicised his relationship with Assange and described him on Twitter as \u201cmy hero\u201d.... ", " GOODY TRUMP IS A WITCHGOODY FLYNN IS A WITCHGOODY PAUL IS A WITCHGOODY FARAGE IS A WITCHUNNAMED SOURCES HATH SEEN THEM MAKING A MOST UNHOLY PACT WITH THE VILE DEVIL FORT TO LIVE DELICIOUSLY ", " >Stone publicly predicted the 2016 release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign that now lie at the heart of the federal inquiry. Democrats on the House intelligence committee have named Stone in their hearings and, according to the New York Times, he is now under investigation.>Last summer, just a few weeks before Farage met Trump in Mississippi, Stone bragged about having a \u201cmutual friend\u201d who served as an intermediary between himself and Assange. He also mentioned in a separate tweet that he had dinner with Farage, though the date of the encounter is unclear.>After Trump\u2019s victory, Farage was one of the first foreign politicians to meet and celebrate with the Republican president-elect, and had his picture taken with Trump in front of a golden elevator in Trump Tower just days after the US election.>The tweet prompted a curt response from Downing Street, which pointed out that there was \u201cno vacancy\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cWe already have an excellent ambassador.\u201d>The pair met again in February, when they had dinner together with Trump\u2019s daughter and adviser, Ivanka, and her husband and White House adviser, Jared Kushner.>Farage was asked about his relationship with Assange in a recent interview with Die Zeit, the German newspaper, after he was seen on 9 March leaving the Ecuadorian embassy where Assange has lived for years. Farage, who declared he had \u201cnever received a penny from Russia\u201d, said he met Assange for \u201cjournalistic reasons\u201d.... ", " >Pressed on his meetings with Russian officials in the past, Farage initially denied having had any, but then acknowledged that he had met Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to the UK, in 2013.>Asked by Die Zeit what he was doing now, and whether he saw himself as a politician or a journalist, Farage concluded: \u201cChanging public opinion. That\u2019s what I have been doing for 20 years. Using television, media. Shifting public opinion. That\u2019s what I am good at.\u201d>A spokesman for Farage told the Guardian he had only met Assange on that one occasion. \u201cThe meeting was organised by a broadcaster, they could have easily sent another presenter instead.\u201d ", " >>145723>>145724>>145726>>145727>>145729>>145730>maybe if I spam the article line for line and word for word across SIX WHOLE POSTS, I can make propaganda into reality!Protip: You can't.

And the White House is also bound to face new pressure from Trump's apparent disclosure of classified information in a private meeting with Russian officials at the White House earlier this month.>Warner, in an interview with CNN on Monday, said the White House must turn over records related to that meeting -- and did not rule out issuing a subpoena for the records.>\"We have made the request,\" Warner said. \"Transcripts or tapes.

Elijah Cummings cites a Report of Investigation from the Pentagon, which was conducted by investigators undertaking a review for Flynn's security clearance application.>According to that March 14, 2016 report, Flynn made false statements to investigators about who funded his foreign trips, including a 2015 trip to Russia where Flynn was paid roughly $45,000 for a speaking engagement. He claimed they were funded by \"US companies,\" even though he was paid by Russia Today, according to the letter released Monday by House Democrats on the Oversight Committee.

Leaders of both the Senate and House panels, which are conducting separate investigations into Russia's election-year meddling, rejected that request.>During the 2016 campaign, Trump blasted aides to Hillary Clinton for taking the Fifth Amendment in relation to the investigation of her use of a private email server while secretary of state. He said at a September Iowa rally: \"So there are five people taking the Fifth Amendment, like you see on the mob, right? You see the mob takes the Fifth.

However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder.

The President would ask NATO countries to match any increase in US troop numbers in AfghanistanThe recommendation is being pushed by National Security Adviser HR McMaster, who was one of the forces behind the surge in Iraq under George W. Bush.It would reverse the trend of steady US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Mr Obama, who was wary of the dwindling public support for the 15-year war and the mounting casualties.The new strategy would allow for greater US air support of Afghan operations and allow US military advisers to accompany local forces near to conflict zones.

It\u2019s indicative of a cultural overhaul taking place under the Trump administration\u2014where well-connected multi-national corporations are poised to see significant financial gains because of tougher immigration law enforcement.>GEO Group has close ties to Trump\u2019s political circles. The company gave $250,000 to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to USA Today. A subsidiary of the company gave $225,000 to a super PAC helmed by the Mercer family. And Rebekah Mercer, hedge fund manager Robert Mercer\u2019s daughter, is widely reported to be one of the most influential donors in Trump\u2019s circle. And last October, the company retained two former aides to now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to lobby the federal government on prison contracts, as Politico reported.>Beyond being politically connected, GEO Group is controversial. Immigrants\u2019 rights groups have long criticized it and its biggest American counterpart, CoreCivic, for the way they treat detainees. And in February, a federal judge ruled that former detainees at one GEO immigrant detention center could direct a class-action lawsuit at the company for forcing them to work for little or no wages\u2014which they allege violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. GEO strongly denies those allegations.... "}, "replies": [" >On the call, executives noted that Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration enforcement and Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 recent announcement on prosecuting undocumented immigrants more forcefully will mean more arrests, more detention and, thus, more demand for their services\u2014which their CEO, George Zoley, said were \u201cculturally responsive environments.\u201d>The call gave a broad picture of how private prison companies expect to see the Trump administration roll out its immigration crackdown: with more deportations of people with deep ties to the United States, and more immigrant detention in the northeast of the country.>Zoley said a new ICE contract for a 1,000-bed detention center in Conroe, Texas, will cost $117 million to build and will generate $44 million in revenue per year once it\u2019s opened in late 2018. The CEO said the company expects \u201cincreased demand for detention capacity at the federal level,\u201d and that it bought the Maverick County Detention Center in Texas for $15 million to meet that demand.>On top of that, the CEO noted the company has enough space to detain 7000 more people than it is right now, which could mean another $60 million per year in revenue.>GEO Group investors who asked questions on the call were closely following the impact of Trump\u2019s changes on the business, peppering the executives with questions about how policy changes could make the company more lucrative. Michael Kodesch, an analyst with Cannacord Genuity, asked what the company saw as \u201cthe new opportunity set\u201d given Congressional budgeting.>\u201cWhat we see is ICE beginning to implement their interior enforcement strategy,\u201d said David Venturella, the company\u2019s senior vice president of business development. \u201cFor the past 8 to 10 years, the focus has been on the border. I think everybody has seen the number of apprehensions and crossings going down, so Phase 2 of that strategy is to focus in the interior.... ", " >\u201cDoes the change or, I guess, the introduction of more emphasis on interior enforcement\u2014does that change the agency\u2019s geographic preference, as far as incremental bed demand?\u201d>Venturella responded that he expected more immigrant detention facilities near big cities.>\u201cI think as ICE deploys more resources to the larger metropolitan areas within the United States, I think the bed needs will be closer to those sources,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yes, there will be less needs along the border if the rate of border-crossings and apprehensions remain low, then the need will shift to the interior part of the United States.\u201d>Then Sommer asked how enforcement could \u201cimpact activity levels\u201d at the U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons, both of which also have contracts with GEO.>\u201cWell, I think any enforcement by federal law enforcement agencies could generate more prosecution convictions and then eventual detention in the federal system,\u201d Venturella said. \u201cI think the attorney general\u2019s recent announcement regarding the prosecution of criminal aliens would apply to all the federal agencies, so we will monitor the impact of that new policy directive. But certainly, any increase in law enforcement activity could generate additional apprehensions and then eventually detentions.\u201d>In the final months of the Obama administration, the Justice Department announced it would stop signing new contracts with private prison companies. That announcement came after a watchdog report concluded people incarcerated in private prisons were more likely to commit crimes again than than people held in public ones.

Was there even some period of reflection on his ideas or did they just change the instant that Bannon said we've got to get Republican healthcare done?If they were honest, I'd bet a lot of Trump's hardcore support would agree, but still support him because Bannon is the ideological one that gives Trump his marching orders, and in exchange Trump gets to milk his office for all it'll get him.

Within days, the online thread \u2014 and similar discussions across the internet \u2014 was flooded with hundreds of users in the United States offering to help the digital campaign.>But the American tactics have not translated overseas.>Despite such efforts, the far right in the United States and elsewhere has so far failed to reach much of the French electorate ahead of the country\u2019s vote this weekend, according to a review of social media activity done for The New York Times. The analysis, which was based on a review of millions of Twitter messages related to the election since last summer, showed that more than one-third of posts linked to certain political hashtags originated from the United States, although few went viral in France.>\u201cThere\u2019s a big cultural gap that these groups have to jump over to expand their message,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, who has studied the far right\u2019s recent efforts in France. \u201cThe language and iconography of the alt-right is pretty specific. Most of it just isn\u2019t going to translate well.\u201d>The French presidential election is the latest front in the digital assault by the American far right or alt-right, a diverse and loosely connected group of internet-based radicals who have garnered attention by using memes \u2014 online satirical photographs with often biting captions \u2014 and other tactics to further their views worldwide. ... ", " >The activists, a combination of white supremacists, anti-Semitic campaigners and other far-right types, were closely linked to the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, although the extent of their influence remains unclear.>Their efforts have fallen flat in France, with memes often written in English and extremist photos and images that do not resonate with the French electorate. American-style fake news and other digital misinformation have also failed to gain traction in France, where its own domestic issues and ways of campaigning still dominate.>The muted response in France could portend a similar response by voters in Britain and Germany when they head to the polls later this year in their own national elections.>\u201cThere has been an effort to spread fake news, but not to the same extent as what we saw in the U.S. campaign,\u201d said Tommaso Venturini, a researcher at the m\u00e9dialab of Sciences Po Paris. \u201cSo far, it\u2019s hard to see any evidence of the impact of fake news on the potential outcome.\u201d>While international activists have found it difficult to break into the French political discourse, local campaigners, often from the country\u2019s own far right, have had more success.... ", " >Ms. Le Pen\u2019s social media team has fought a guerrilla-style war to spread its message online, including a dedicated group that shares videos and photos online that attack her political foes. A loose network of Facebook and Twitter users has similarly backed her campaign while disparaging Emmanuel Macron, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s opponent and the front-runner to be France\u2019s next president. Many of these social media messages have been shared by the supporters of more traditional politicians, including those of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a right-wing candidate who finished third in last month\u2019s first-round election.>While muted, American-style fake news has also made an appearance.>Ahead of last month\u2019s vote, for instance, a fake news site masquerading as Le Soir, a Belgian newspaper, tried to spread rumors that Saudi Arabia was financing Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a niece of Ms. Le Pen, posted the piece on Twitter before quickly removing the link after local media outlets debunked the claim.>Still, for many in France, such outright fake news stories have been met merely with Gallic shrugs. And the digital tactics of international campaigners have been even less effective.>In part, that is because alt-right activists from the United States and beyond have copied the movement\u2019s American extremist images and language without tweaking them to entice the French electorate.... ", " >After the anonymous internet user called on others on 4Chan, an online message board favored by the alt-right, to start a \u201cTotal Meme War\u201d to help Ms. Le Pen, he warned against mimicking American-style attacks. Yet international supporters repeatedly used Pepe the Frog, a cartoon tied to anti-Semitism and racism that has become an unofficial mascot of the alt-right movement. Many did so without realizing the amphibian is often used as a slur against French people.>In the last two weeks, far-right activists have created multiple memes attacking Mr. Macron \u2014 complete with captions and hashtags written in English. Ahead of this weekend\u2019s election, some of these images on Facebook and Twitter portrayed Mr. Macron as a 21st century equivalent to Marie Antoinette, the out-of-touch last queen of France, while others linked him with false allegations of an extramarital affair.>But such moves have barely registered with French-speaking Twitter users, particularly local nationalists who already bristle at English overtaking French as the world\u2019s most popular language. Almost two-thirds of Twitter messages using the hashtag MFGA \u2014 or Make France Great Again \u2014 have originated from the United States, according to David Chavalarias, a French academic, who created a digital tool to analyze more than 80 million Twitter messages about the French election....

Bannon, is now a senior White House official, helped to share messages with a wider audience in the United States. But in France, no outlet has similarly embraced the international alt-right during the recent election.>\u201cThese trolls are trying to make a difference globally,\u201d said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor at the Mercer University who has studied the rise of the far right online in the United States. \u201cBut their inability to do so shows how limited of an impact they are actually having.\u201d ", " meanwhile on /pol/>>>/pol/124227512>>>/pol/124226045 ", " >>137053>does not translate well into Frenchtranslation> the typical European voter isn't as gullible and myopic ", " >>137063So is /pol/ right? /pol/ told me they know the \"dark secrets\" of real life ", " >>137079Even a stopped clock is right sometimes, Anon.

A 100-foot (30-meter) tall canyon formed at the end of the glacier, rerouting the melting water, Shugar and his colleagues wrote in a study published in Monday's journal Nature Geoscience .>The term \"river piracy\" is usually used to describe events that take a long time to occur, such as tens of thousands of years, and had not been seen in modern times, especially not this quickly, said study co-author Jim Best of the University of Illinois.

It was like a snake-shaped lake rather than a river.\">What had been a river delta at the edge of the Slims River had changed into a place full of \"afternoon dust storms with this fine dust getting into your nose and your mouth,\" Best said.>The lack of water in the Slims wasn't because of changes in rainfall, Shugar said. They know that because it's a river fed mostly by glacial melt, not rain, and the Alsek increased in amounts similar to what disappeared from the Slims.>The Kaskawulsh glacier covers about 9,650 square miles (25,000 square kilometers), about the size of Vermont. The front of the glacier has retreated nearly 1.2 miles (1.9 kilometers) since 1899, Shugar said.>The scientists calculate that there is only a 1 in 200 chance that the retreating glacier and river piracy is completely natural without man-made global warming.

The case languished for months, until Fern\u00e1ndez released the men's taped words to the news media, sparking national outrage. Finally, arrest warrants were issued. The first trial began a couple of months ago, after Diego Cruz, 21, was extradited to Mexico from Spain. (In a statement, the four accused deny ever admitting to the rape. They say Daphne got inside the Mercedes voluntarily because \u201cshe wanted the party to go on.\")It seemed as if Daphne might finally get something like justice. Instead, her father's prediction came true. A judge found that Cruz had touched the victim\u2019s breasts and penetrated her with his fingers. But, the judge said, that didn't make Cruz guilty of assault, because he'd acted without \u201ccarnal intent.\u201d The judge also found that while Daphne was forced into the car, she was never \u201chelpless.\u201d Cruz was deemed innocent.Daphne's story \u2014 its horrible beginning and unjust end \u2014 has rippled across Mexico. Perhaps that's because the tale is so familiar. \u201cTo many citizens\u201d in Veracruz, \u201cthere is little difference between the rich and the government, and between the government and the criminals,\u201d according to the New Yorker piece. The ferocious Zeta drug cartel has a near-monopoly over the state. Eight out of 10 people there say they live in fear.

In 2014, only 1 in 10 was reported to local authorities, according to Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Geography. The Mexican government\u2019s National Institute for Women says more than 80 percent of sexual assaults are not reported, and barely 4.5 percent of criminals face sentencing in Mexico. A majority of victims told researchers that they didn't report because they didn't want to \u201cwaste their time,\u201d the New Yorker piece said, citing a study.Women in Mexico are being abducted, raped and killed at record rates. Women in areas hit hard by the drug war are particularly vulnerable. In conflict zones, women become \u201cterritory\u201d to be conquered, and rape is a tool used to intimidate rival gangs and the local population.

Robert Bentley resigned Monday, his power and popularity diminished by a sex scandal that staggered the state, brought him to the brink of impeachment and prompted a series of criminal investigations.>Ellen Brooks, a special prosecutor, said Mr. Bentley quit in connection with a plea agreement on two misdemeanor charges: failing to file a major contribution report and knowingly converting campaign contributions to personal use. He pleaded guilty Monday afternoon.>It was a stunning downfall for the governor, a Republican who acknowledged in March 2016 that he had made sexually charged remarks to his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason.>\u201cI have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama\u2019s governor,\u201d Mr. Bentley said at the State Capitol. He did not mention the charges to which he pleaded guilty, or the deal with prosecutors that mandated his resignation.>His exit from government and guilty pleas followed mounting calls for his resignation, especially after a report that was made public on Friday said he had fostered \u201can atmosphere of intimidation\u201d and compelled state employees to help him cover up his relationship with Ms. Mason. Impeachment hearings \u2014 the first in Alabama in more than a century \u2014 began Monday morning, when the State House was consumed by rumors that the governor would soon quit....

Two days later, a lawyer hired by the Alabama House of Representatives released a report portraying Mr. Bentley as deceitful and desperate before his relationship with Ms. Mason made him a punch line.>The 131-page report said Mr. Bentley had offered little cooperation to legislative investigators, and it alleged that the governor\u2019s critics had been subjected to coercion, including harassing messages and the threat of prosecution. The report described how Mr. Bentley tried to use a member of his security detail to break up with Ms. Mason on his behalf and how he demanded that Ms. Mason be allowed to travel in official vehicles after she left the state\u2019s payroll.... ", " >It also explored Mr. Bentley\u2019s efforts to keep audio recordings of suggestive conversations with Ms. Mason from the public. In one such conversation, which rippled across the internet last year, the governor described embracing Ms. Mason and placing his hands on her breasts.>By the weekend, legislative leaders had demanded that the governor quit, echoing a faction of rank-and-file members in his own party who spent months vocally opposing him. On Sunday night, the steering committee of the Alabama Republican Party made a similar call. And by sunset Monday, Mr. Bentley was out of power.>In court documents, the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office said Mr. Bentley had failed to disclose a $50,000 personal loan to his campaign account. The office also said Mr. Bentley had allowed nearly $9,000 of campaign money to be used for Ms. Mason\u2019s lawyers.>Mr. Bentley was sentenced to a suspended jail term, fined $7,000, placed on probation and ordered to complete community service. In an email on Monday, Ms. Mason declined to comment.>Yet until Mr. Bentley\u2019s court appearance, it was unclear that he would actually abandon the job to which he was easily re-elected in 2014.

This year\u2019s mass bleaching, second in severity only to 2016, has occurred even in the absence of an El Ni\u00f1o event.>Mass bleaching \u2013 a phenomenon caused by global warming-induced rises to sea surface temperatures \u2013 has occurred on the reef four times in recorded history.>Prof Terry Hughes, who led the surveys, said the length of time coral needed to recover \u2013 about 10 years for fast-growing types \u2013 raised serious concerns about the increasing frequency of mass bleaching events.>\u201cThe significance of bleaching this year is that it\u2019s back to back, so there\u2019s been zero time for recovery,\u201d Prof Hughes told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s too early yet to tell what the full death toll will be from this year\u2019s bleaching, but clearly it will extend 500km south of last year\u2019s bleaching.\u201d>Last year, in the worst-affected areas to the reef\u2019s north, roughly two-thirds of shallow-water corals were lost.http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/great-barrier-reef-in-crisis-as-scientists-despair-at-bleaching-data-1.3043367 "}, "replies": [" >Prof Hughes has warned Australia now faces a closing window to save the reef by taking decisive action on climate change.Other stresses>The 2017 bleaching is likely to be compounded by other stresses on the reef, including the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish and poor water quality. The category-four tropical cyclone Debbie came too late and too far south for its cooling effect to alleviate bleaching.>But Prof Hughes said its slow movement across the reef was likely to have caused destruction to coral along a path up to 100km wide. \u201cIt added to the woes of the bleaching. It came too late to stop the bleaching, and it came to the wrong place,\u201d he said.>The University of Technology Sydney\u2019s lead reef researcher, marine biologist David Suggett, said that to properly recover, affected reefs needed to be connected to those left untouched by bleaching.>He said Prof Hughes\u2019s survey results showed such connectivity was in jeopardy. \u201cIt\u2019s that connection ultimately that will drive the rate and extent of recovery,\u201d Mr Suggett said. \u201cSo if bleaching events are moving around the [Great Barrier Reef] system on an annual basis, it does really undermine any potential resilience through connectivity between neighbouring reefs.\u201d>Some reef scientists are now becoming despondent. Water quality expert Jon Brodie said the reef was now in a \u201cterminal stage\u201d. Mr Brodie has devoted much of his life to improving water quality on the reef, one of a suite of measures used to stop bleaching.>He said measures to improve water quality, which were a central tenet of the Australian government\u2019s rescue effort, were failing.>\u201cWe\u2019ve given up. It\u2019s been my life managing water quality, we\u2019ve failed,\u201d Mr Brodie said. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve spent a lot of money, we\u2019ve had no success.\u201d>Mr Brodie said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated. ", " >\u201cLast year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,\u201d Mr Brodie said. \u201cThe federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programmes, the water quality management is having very limited success. It\u2019s unsuccessful.\u201dOptimism>Others remain optimistic, out of necessity. Jon Day was a director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years until retiring in 2014.>Mr Day, whose expertise lies in protected area planning and management, said the federal government\u2019s approach to protecting the reef was sorely lacking. He said it was taking too relaxed an approach to fishing, run-off and pollution from farming, and the dumping of maintenance dredge spoil.>The government was far short of the $8.2 billion (\u20ac5.8 billion) investment needed to meet water quality targets, he said, and Australia was on track to fail its short-term 2018 water quality targets, let alone achieve more ambitious long-term goals.>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be optimistic, I think we have to be,\u201d Mr Day said. \u201cBut every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn\u2019t helping the issue. We\u2019ve been denying it for so long, and now we\u2019re starting to accept it. But we\u2019re spending insufficient amounts addressing the problem.\u201d>The Queensland tourism industry raised questions about the reliability of the survey, saying scientists had previously made exaggerated claims about mortality rates and bleaching.>\u201cThere is no doubt that we have had a significant bleaching event off Cairns this time around,\u201d said Col McKenzie, of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators.>\u201cThe far north probably did a little bit better, Port Douglas to Townsille has seen some significant bleaching,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately we haven\u2019t seen much mortality at this time, and fortunately the temperatures have fallen.\u201d ", " >Mr McKenzie said more money needed to be invested in water quality measures, and criticized what he saw as a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach to water quality projects up and down the coast.

Hughes and his team conducted the aerial survey that confirmed both 2016 and 2017 bleaching events.>Rising sea temperatures driven by global warming are primarily to blame for the widespread and rapid degradation of the reef.

U.S. senators also can take money from trusts they establish, but there\u2019s a difference with the Trump situation because senators must house their assets in blind trusts.>Questions about how deeply involved the president can be with his businesses have cropped up with the announcement of the trust in January. While control of the company passed from Mr. Trump to Donald Jr. and Weissenberg, along with his other adult son, Eric, there is no legal stricture preventing him from being involved in company operations.>Mr. Trump has pledged to get reports only on the Trump Organization\u2019s basic financial performance, although that has no force of law. Eric Trump told Forbes magazine that he intends to brief his father on company doings.>Another controversy surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s purported conflicts involves the Trump International Hotel, which is located in the Old Post Office building near the White House. One ethics law a president must obey is a constitutional bar on receiving money from foreign governments. Known as the \u201cemoluments clause\u201d in the U.S. Constitution, this provision is meant to shield the president from foreign bribes.Critics say foreign powers might seek Mr. Trump\u2019s favor by staying at his hotel.>But a recent ruling by the GSA, which owns the hotel site, concluded the facility is not in violation of its lease by accepting rental income that benefits Mr. Trump.

Russia has denied the allegations.Mr. Flynn also was paid tens of thousands of dollars by three Russian companies, including the state-sponsored media network RT, for speeches he made shortly before he became a formal adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, according to documents obtained by a congressional oversight committee.Democratic lawmakers have requested a copy of the security-clearance form that Mr. Flynn was required to file before joining Mr. Trump in the White House, to see if he disclosed sources of foreign income.And they have asked the Defense Department to investigate whether Mr. Flynn, a retired Army general, violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by accepting money from RT, which U.S. intelligence officials say is part of a state-funded media apparatus.

Michael Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador to the US in Dec via telephone. It was a benign conversation. He knew it was being monitored, as he is a former monitor of such communications. But he mistakenly thought that those who were monitoring him were patriots as he is. They were not.They violated federal law by revealing in part what Flynn had said, and they did so in a manner to embarrass and infuriate Trump.Why would they do this? Perhaps because they feared Flynn\u2019s being in the White House, since he knows the power and depth of the deep state. Perhaps to send a message to Trump because he once compared American spies to Nazis. Perhaps because they believe that their judgment of the foreign dangers America faces is superior to the president\u2019s. Perhaps because they hate and fear the outsider in the White House.The chickens have come home to roost. In our misguided efforts to keep the country safe, we have neglected to keep it free. We have enabled a deep state to become powerful enough to control a powerful president. We have placed so much data and so much power in the hands of unelected, unaccountable, opaque spies that they can use it as they see fit \u2013 even to the point of committing federal felonies. Now some have boasted that they can manipulate and thus control the president of the United States by selectively revealing and concealing what they know about anyone, including the president himself.This is a perilous state of affairs, brought about by the maniacal passion for surveillance spawned under George W. Bush and perfected under Barack Obama \u2013 all with utter indifference to the widespread constitutional violations and permanent destruction of personal liberties.

Distressed crying can be heard on the soundtrack.>Parent and journalist Laura June almost immediately noticed something was not quite right as her three-year-old daughter was watching it.>\"Peppa does a lot of screaming and crying and the dentist is just a bit sadistic and it's just way, way off what a three-year-old should watch,\" June says. She wrote about her experiences on the website The Outline.>\"But the animation is like close enough to looking like Peppa - it's crude but it's close enough that my daughter was like 'This is Peppa Pig.'\">It's far from an isolated case - BBC Trending has found hundreds of similar videos of children's cartoon characters with inappropriate themes. In addition to Peppa Pig, there are similar videos featuring characters from the Disney movie Frozen, the Minions franchise, Doc McStuffins, Thomas the Tank Engine, and many more.>Some of the videos are parodies or have such over-the-top content that they're clearly meant for mature audiences. Others are unauthorised copies of authentic cartoons or use the characters in innocent ways - troubling to copyright lawyers perhaps, but not necessarily harmful to children.>However many, like the video Laura June's daughter saw, both contain disturbing content and can pass for the real cartoons, particularly when viewed by children....

They feature animated violence and graphic toilet humour.>The people behind the account didn't respond to Trending's request for an interview. We attempted to contact several other producers of similar videos - and got the same result. >Trending also contacted two companies behind the cartoon series being ripped off, Disney and EntOne - the distributor of Peppa Pig. Neither wanted to comment.>So should parents take more care when it comes to allowing their children to watch cartoons on YouTube?>Sonia Livingstone is an expert on child online safety and professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics,>\"It's perfectly legitimate for a parent to believe that something called Peppa Pig is going to be Peppa Pig,\" she says. \"And I think many of them have come to trust YouTube... as a way of entertaining your child for ten minutes while the parent makes a phone call. I think if it wants to be a trusted brand then parents should know that protection is in place.\">\"I don't think we want to police it for the whole world,\" Livingstone says. \"A lot of this material is satirical, creative - or actually offensive but within freedom of expression. What we need is child protection.\"... ", " >YouTube did not offer a spokesperson for interview, but in a statement said: \"We take feedback very seriously. We appreciate people drawing problematic content to our attention, and make it easy for anyone to flag a video.>\"Flagged videos are manually reviewed 24/7 and any videos that don't belong in the app are removed within hours.

Chao \u2014 will immediately start to undo one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant environmental legacies.>During the same week, and possibly on the same day, Mr. Trump is expected to direct Mr. Pruitt to begin the more lengthy and legally complex process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama\u2019s rules to cut planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants.>The regulatory rollback on vehicle pollution will relax restrictions on tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and will not require action by Congress. It will also have a major effect on the United States auto industry.>Under the Obama administration\u2019s vehicle fuel economy standards, American automakers were locked into nearly a decade of trying to design and build ever more sophisticated fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric and hybrid models. The nation\u2019s largest auto companies told Mr. Trump last month that they found those technical requirements too burdensome.>The E.P.A. will also begin legal proceedings to revoke a waiver for California that was allowing the state to enforce the tougher tailpipe standards for its drivers.>E.P.A. officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on the move.... "}, "replies": [" >On Feb. 21, a coalition of the 17 largest companies that sell cars in the United States sent two letters to Mr. Pruitt, asking him to revisit the tailpipe rules. They said it may be \u201cthe single most important decision the E.P.A. has made in recent history.\u201d>They complained about the steep technical challenge posed by the stringent standard, noting that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it. That even excludes some hybrid cars, plug-in electric cars and fuel cell vehicles, the automakers wrote. \u201cEven today, no conventional vehicle today meets that target.\u201d>The automakers estimated their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion between 2012 and 2025 to comply and said the tailpipe emissions rule was far more expensive for the industry than enforcing the Clean Power Plan.>Former Obama administration officials and environmentalists denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s expected announcement.>\u201cThe rest of the world is moving forward with electric cars. If the Trump administration goes backward, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to compete globally,\u201d said Margo T.

William Becker, the executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. He also predicted that \u201cif this administration goes after the California waiver, there will be an all-out brawl between Trump and California and the other states that will defend its program.\u201d>The tailpipe pollution regulations were among Mr. Obama\u2019s major initiatives to reduce global warming and were put forth jointly by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. They would have forced automakers to build passenger cars that achieve an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, compared with about 36 miles per gallon today....

However, the E.P.A. did not jointly release its plan to do so with the Transportation Department, leaving a legal loophole for the Trump administration to take advantage of.>The E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan regulations, which would cut climate-warming pollution from power plants, will probably be much harder for Mr. Pruitt to undo. He will have to legally withdraw the existing rule and propose a new rule to replace it, a process that could take up to two years and is expected to be fraught with legal challenges and delays along the way.>The effort to undo the tailpipe standards will be much more legally simple. After withdrawing the Obama administration\u2019s requirement for model years 2022 through 2025, the Trump administration will have a year to put forth an alternative set of efficiency standards, people familiar with the matter said.

A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived \"forcing\" of climate change.>On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but certain effects seem likely:>On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not. (so far the global average temperature has risen by 2 degrees in the last decade)>Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.

As the Ordovician was so long ago, there are huge uncertainties for that time period (according to the model, CO2 was between an incredible 2400 and 9000 ppmv.) Crucially, GEOCARB has a 10 million year timestep, leading Berner to explicitly advise against using his model to estimate Late Ordovician CO2 levels due its inability to account for short-term CO2 fluctuations. He noted that \"exact values of CO2... should not be taken literally.\">When looking at events such as these from the deep geological past, it is vital to keep in mind that there are many uncertainties, and generally speaking, the further back we look, the more there are.>Also, although CO2 is a key factor in controlling the climate, it would be a mistake to think it's the only factor; ignore the other elements and you'll most likely get the story wrong.Learn to science anon ", " >>127122Funny how this level of skepticism only goes one way.When someone argues in favor of CO2 alarmism \"the science is settled\"But when someone argues CO2 isn't a doomsday device \"it is vital to keep in mind that there are many uncertainties\"Lol ", " >>127122>Berner to explicitly advise against using his model to estimate Late Ordovician CO2 levelsThis doesn't debunk anything posted.

Why dont you subject bloggers to the same level of scrutiny?>>127132First of all, nobody's disagreeing that CO2 levels were on average higher. Your problem (and Steven Goddard's) is that your drawing false conclusions without going into the detail of the data or modelling. Google GEOCARB and read up on it. I bet your Steven Goddard links dont tell you that all those CO2 data points on that graph are in multimillion year time steps. The temporal resolution is horrible.I'll start your research off:(Berner et al. 2001) http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~ajs/2001/Feb/qn020100182.pdf>\"It should be emphasized that GEOCARB modeling has only a long time resolution.

In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation. Additional positive feedbacks which play an important role in this process include other greenhouse gases, and changes in ice sheet cover and vegetation patterns.>A 2012 study by Shakun et al. looked at temperature changes 20,000 years ago (the last glacial-interglacial transition) from around the world and added more detail to our understanding of the CO2-temperature change relationship. They found that:>The Earth's orbital cycles triggered warming in the Arctic approximately 19,000 years ago, causing large amounts of ice to melt, flooding the oceans with fresh water. >This influx of fresh water then disrupted ocean current circulation, in turn causing a seesawing of heat between the hemispheres.>The Southern Hemisphere and its oceans warmed first, starting about 18,000 years ago.

Africa is far harder hit with over 9 in 10 reported cases), and there are other agricultural pesticides that can be used that aren't nearly as harmful. You can also still legally use DDT for public health reasons (controlling localized infestations, which has a much higher impact on disease control), and with a malaria death toll of only 6 in the US your \"millions potentially dead!\" doesn't hold a lot of water.Localized use of DDT, especially inside homes, continues to be a thing outside the US, which decreases environmental impact AND reduces the rate at which mosquitoes become resistant to the chemical while offering the most protection to residents.The only countries to still use DDT as an agricultural pesticide are India and North Korea.So I find it fucking ironic that you blast environmentalists for being alarmist \"better safe than sorry!\" types who don't do a proper cost-benefit analysis while you do the exact same thing as a counterargument.

You do see a considerable drop off in valid votes (blank ballots, graffiti, etc) in the second round due to people being mad about their guy not getting to the second round, but in the end I think it helps break up the two party system while giving the winner a majority of the vote (thus shoring up their power a bit).

Agricultural spraying isn't as directly useful for the control of fucking malaria, it's useful for controlling pests eating crops, for which other pesticides can do the same job without fucking up birds or causing cancer. Mosquito control via crop spraying is incidental at best.We could also cut malaria rates by dumping DDT out of planes flying all over the planet and spraying every inch of the planet's surface, but nobody would do that because the effects on people and the environment would greatly outweigh the benefit of killing mosquitoes carrying malaria (not to mention the astronomical costs of producing and deploying that much DDT) and that wouldn't even kill them all due to natural resistance. At some point you need to do a cost-benefit analysis to see what level of DDT deployment makes the most sense, and incidentally killing mosquitoes via crop dusting is not in the positive. Couple that with the increasing effectiveness of DDT alternatives and you'd have to be mad to want legal DDT.You also cannot definitely prove that things would be better with continued DDT agricultural deployment, since mosquito resistance to the chemical has also been growing, and during widespread DDT use the resistance rate was climbing even faster. Also to be considered is diminishing returns as DDT saturation reached its maximum potential.Plus the localized agricultural DDT ban in the United States made sense, especially with the minimal number of malaria deaths in modern US history. A global ban might have been excessive, but signing on the ban was optional and nations individually were already placing bans given their low malaria rates.>>127945I didn't see that post when I made the first reply, so I had to make another post.

Because it's still banned for agricultural use and hasn't ever been banned for localized deployment (\"public health concern\"), aka THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND LEAST ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTFUL USE. Malaria control groups specifically cite that widespread use as an agricultural pesticide was increasing the number of DDT resistant mosquitoes, and that localized use has been far better at combating the disease. ", " >>127969To add further, DDT was already on it's way out agriculturally before any regulations were passed (production was ramping down in the early 70's in the order of millions of pounds). Insects were getting increasingly resistant and alternative pesticides were getting more effective, so it was time to retire DDT regardless in the role of agriculture.Again, DDT continues to see use as disease control. It just doesn't have a place in agriculture, for which all these bans apply (though some countries did push for total bans of the substance, they still have exceptions for public health).

So this is the sort of bad \"we don't know,\" sort of like \"we don't know if dropping nukes on the ocean will wake up Godzilla, but we should probably not do that just in case and find some other way to do it to be sure\" but in a more serious, non-fantastical way.>Spraying the areas where most of the bugs are sounds like wise disease control, no?Which is not farm fields. My whole argument here has been about widespread agricultural use, in which DDT was used more out of a commercial need than a human health and safety need. Spraying crops was more about preventing bugs from eating them (thus ruining their sale value) than trying to kill mosquitoes before they could spread malaria. In fact agricultural use was harming their health and safety use, because the number of resistant mosquitoes was going up way faster than anticipated.Spraying home interiors has generally been shown to be more effective (beyond killing, it also wards away resistant bugs) and other chemicals have taken the agricultural role (and when \"nuke em all\" is needed, those same chemicals should be the first line of defense before invoking the public health clause of the DDT ban).As a side note, it's really weird to be arguing against someone who is pro-use of chemicals.

In Africa you're talking a way different cost/benefit ratio.And again, agricultural use vs localized disease control. To argue spraying fields is efficient in preventing malaria is to argue that you should be spraying literally everything (because these suckers breed everywhere), which is just ridiculous. Localized use in homes and on persons is way more logical and reduces ecological spillover.>Also about the mosquitoes becoming resistantResistance is something that happens naturally. When a disease is introduced into a population, some number of that population will be immune or otherwise less effected. As that disease kills it leaves behind the creatures that were resistant or immune to the disease, who then make up a larger portion of the successive generation. It's just basic evolution, natural selection and all that. ", " >>127980Continuing on resistance, the more you expose a population to a disease, the more likely you are to move towards resistance or immunity. This is why when doctors prescribe medication they avoid using a specific medication too much (in duration and dosage) to avoid accidentally making whatever afflicts the patient resistant or immune. By rotating medication, you can effectively kill bacteria without leaving any resistant or immune survivors who would otherwise repopulate and take the place of the dead cells (thus moving back to square one minus one medication).Penicillin, the original wonder antibacterial, is always in danger of being rendered useless by this process, so new strains of the mold are always being developed to keep ahead of the resistance race.>like antibacterial soap creating a super bugIt's an exaggeration of a real mechanism. Remember that soap is only advertised to kill \"99.9% of germs\" because there are some things that are sufficiently resistant to not be killed by it. Over time, as you eliminate the \"easy prey,\" you're slowly left with stuff that just won't die. This doesn't guarantee the spread of said illnesses (because if they were that contagious they would have caused an epidemic already), but given some other changes to the disease's attack vector it could turn into something worse. However, because sop still kills most germs that would otherwise be harmful, it's a hell of a lot worse to stop using soap out of fear of some superbug that may or may not happen based on random evolution in an unrelated factor.

If your goal is to protect people from disease, you are better off protecting homes and persons with pesticides than dumping the stuff in wide areas (because without 100% coverage they just come back or migrate from other areas). It's like spraying bug repellent into a random area vs spraying it on a person directly, defending the end target is more effective than scattershot deployment.Plus the alternative pesticides in America like DEET are just as effective, as showcased by our astronomically low malaria death rate, even post DDT ban.>As for the resistance, thanks for the lesson. Seems like the bugs should have been able to surpass our pesticides by now. Interdasting. Maybe Monsanto is a good guy after all.As I said, the more you expose them to it, the more that the resistant ones repopulate. This is why DDT use was already in natural decline in the US, because manufactures noticed that the effectiveness was starting to drop off (especially against the crop eating pests that weren't mosquitoes, who are the main target of agricultural use). Environmental impact reports just sealed the deal on what was already a declining product in the process of being replaced. ", " >>127992>As I said, the more you expose them to it, the more that the resistant ones repopulateSorry but this just isn't making sense. You could say that about every pest control. So why cherry pick DDT for a ban?I also do not buy the natural decline argument. That's awful convenient. What I'm reading on this issue suggests there was a great deal of activism involved in getting this banned. Now that the science is showing that to be a mistake, people want to revise history. ", " >>127996It does apply to every pest control, it's just that for the purpose of malaria prevention, continued use of DDT as a commercial agricultural pesticide was harming it's effectiveness as a mosquito killer. You want to make sure that when you try to kill something, you do so in the most direct method possible to reduce the resistance increase. Again with the doctor example, drug courses should be short and varied to avoid reduced effectiveness. This is why there was an agricultural ban, because this was just boosting resistance without effectively killing mosquitoes. Once the commercial viability of the product was reduced, it was better to stop the commercial use to preserve the public health use.>So why cherry pick DDT for a ban?Environmental concerns, which we're deadlocked on so there's no point going further on that issue. You don't like my sources, and I can't find the original FWS report that Fox news cites, so I can't confirm that's the correct reading of the report (because journalists, left and right, tend to fuck up reading science reports as noted in other threads), and I can't find other studies that confirm or contradict that study. The once place that claims to have it is behind a paywall, and I'm not spending money for an internet discussion.>I also do not buy the natural decline argument.Production of DDT was down 13 million pounds in 1971 before the full ban. Manufactures cited a reduced effectiveness of the product, increased effectiveness of other chemicals, and mounting environmental concerns; so two out of three reasons had nothing to do with the environment.>Now that the science is showing that to be a mistake, people want to revise history.Full bans were considered and passed at a country level, but the global UN ban (and the US ban) make explicit exceptions for direct anti-mosquito applications because they understood that a complete removal of DDT wouldn't be possible until an equally effective replacement could be developed. ", " >>127959>Malaria should've been extinct by now.You obviously have no idea what malaria is or how it works, or how and why humans get it and die, and how it's controlled. You also clearly have no idea how either pest or disease eradication works and why it may or may not be possible even in theory.In other words, you're a fucking idiot.That said, government-funded scientists at a government-funded university are now testing a method of introducing genetically-engineered males that sterilize the next generation in the malaria vector species of mosquito (believed to be inconsequential if its population plummets or goes to 0, as it shares its niche with other species of mosquitoes). So yeah, socialism. ", " >>127999Man I'm always hitting character limit. Back to production, since I forgot this part (and it would be a lot easier if I could just post one of the charts):So for comparison, DDT production peaked in 1963 at nearly 100k tons, while domestic consumption had already peaked years earlier in 1959 at 40k tons. In those four years, domestic consumption was dropping steadily while exports rose (thus we can conclude that DDT was becoming less effective against crop-eaters in North America, while it retained viability elsewhere). \"Silent Spring,\" the book notable for starting the whole anti-DDT thing, released in 1962, and domestic use continued its steady decline until the ban in 1972, when consumption was a mere 12.5k tons, a mere 15% of peak consumption. Production and exports did see a see a more rapid decline, hitting a production number of just over 25k tons (exports were slightly more than half of production) just before the ban. Production continues to this day, but at a reduced rate for use in localized pest control.Oddly, I also found some charts correlating polio with pesticide production (so not just DDT), but I haven't read the reports on that and no other materials I've seen so far make a causation claim specific to DDT.Anyway, in conclusion I don't think we're ever going to agree because we can't agree on the environmental damage assessment. Without agreement on those points, we will never have cost benefit models based on the same data for comparison. At the same time, DDT was never a silver bullet solution for malaria as it was steadily losing effectiveness, so I don't think preventing the DDT ban would have saved untold millions, especially in the US where malaria is at a historic low (the UN ban was not until decades later). Plus it was never banned for public health and safety as a direct solution, where it continues to be effective mostly because even resistant mosquitoes avoid home interiors with DDT or derivatives. ", " >>128009>Anyway, in conclusion I don't think we're ever going to agreeTrue but I'll admit that the DDT ban was not as harmful as I initially thought.

In fact, she embraced it. She tanned and braided her hair.Her first marriage to an African American man was rough because Dolezal writes she was \"too black\" for him.During a television interview in November 2015, Dolezal acknowledged being born to white parents, but also said she identifies as black. Amid the controversy of her racial identity she stepped down as president of the Spokane, Wash., branch of the NAACP.Last year, Dolezal legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, a West African way of saying \"gift from the gods,\" to help with job searches but continues to use Dolezal for her public persona AP reports.In February, Dolezal said she was on food stamps because she's been unable to find work.Dolezal said in a release she wrote the book to advance the conversation about race and to set the record straight about her life.I wish Americans understood that race is a social construct, even if we don't want it to be, she said in the release. The system of racial classification is fiction, and we need to thoughtfully evaluate whether perpetuating it rigidly or allowing fluidity across the spectrum best supports human rights and social justice.http://www.wtsp.com/news/rachel-dolezal-i-was-too-black-for-my-husband/425333658 "}, "replies": [" >>125109Not news.

The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Science would lose $900 million, or nearly 20% of its $5 billion budget. The proposal also calls for deep cuts to the research programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and a 5% cut to NASA's earth science budget. And it would eliminate DOE's roughly $300 million Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.>There appears to be no mention, however, of the National Science Foundation (NSF) in a 62-page document outlining the proposal obtained by The Washington Post. NSF's budget request may not become clear until the White House fleshes out the details of its spending plan over the next 2 months.>The NIH proposal is drawing deep concern from biomedical research advocates. \"A $6 billion cut to [NIH] is unacceptable to the scientific community, and should be unacceptable to the American public as well,\" said Benjamin Corb, public affairs director of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Rockville, Maryland, in a statement. \"President Donald Trump's fiscal year 2018 spending plan erases years' worth of bipartisan support for the NIH, and the American biomedical research enterprise which has long been the global leader for biomedical innovation. Cuts this deep threaten America's ability to remain a leader. It is of grave concern to the research community that President Trump's budget proposal\u2014which would fund the agency at a 15-year low\u2014values investments in defense above all other federal expenditures.\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/nih-doe-office-science-face-deep-cuts-trumps-first-budget "}, "replies": [" >NIH's budget was roughly $32 billion in 2016, and was set to receive a $1 billion to $2 billion increase in the 2017 fiscal year, which began this past 1 October. Congress has been unable to finish its 2017 spending plan, however, and the government has been operating under a continuing resolution that freezes spending at 2016 levels.>The spending plan calls for a \u201cmajor reorganization\u201d of the 27 NIH institutes and centers, though it does not spell out the changes\u2014with one exception. It would abolish the Fogarty International Center, a $69.1 million program dedicated to building partnerships between health research institutions in the United States and other countries. The plan also would fold into NIH the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a free-standing agency within HHS devoted to fostering research evidence to improve health care\u2019s quality, safety and accessibility.>At DOE, the department's nuclear weapons programs would grow, while science programs would shrink, reports Steve Mufson of The Washington Post:>The president\u2019s budget would cut spending overall by $1.7billion \u2014 or 5.6 percent from current levels \u2014 to $28billion. But the money is redistributed. The National Nuclear Security Administration budget would grow 11.3percent while the rest of the Energy Department\u2019s programs would be cut by 17.9 percent. >The Office of Science would lose $900 million of its just-over $5billion. The office supports research at more than 300 universities and 10 of the nation\u2019s 17 national labs.>At NASA, a roughly $100 million to cut to the agency's earth sciences program would be mostly achieved by canceling four climate-related missions, according to sources. They are the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3; the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem program; the Deep Space Climate Observatory; and the CLARREO Pathfinder. Overall, NASA receives a 1% cut. ", " >Even before the scope of the cuts became known, it was a safe bet that Trump's request would leave scientists wanting more\u2014not just more funding, but more details on how he wants to spend the money.>White House officials are calling the 2018 document a budget \u201cblueprint\u201d to distinguish it from the comprehensive document they have promised to submit to Congress in 2 months. Trump himself leaked the big news last month: He will ask for $54 billion more for the military, and pay for it with $54 billion in cuts to domestic discretionary spending. That category includes all research programs outside the defense agencies.>Mick Mulvaney, new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters yesterday that the so-called skinny budget fleshes out what the president promised during the campaign and since taking office. \u201cThis is an 'America First' budget,\u201d said Mulvaney, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina. \u201cWe went through his speeches, and we turned those policies into numbers.\u201d>Of course, there\u2019s a lot that Trump has not talked about, including almost all of the government\u2019s $70 billion investment in civilian research. And that suggests today\u2019s budget may be silent on, or vague about, what the president is seeking for some science agencies, much less for specific programs and cross-agency initiatives. In some cases, agency heads will apparently be asked to figure out how to absorb the cuts if they are approved by Congress, by cutting programs, or staff, or both. ", " >Mulvaney did promise the request would contain \u201ca [top] number for each agency,\u201d as well as highlights of how it differs from past years. But the only science agency he flagged was NASA (and avoided mention of NIH). Its current budget of $19.5 billion would drop by 1%, he said, which he characterized as \u201ca small reduction.\u201d At the same time, he added, some NASA programs would get a boost, including a planetary mission to a moon \u201cof either Saturn or Jupiter, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d Space experts are betting that\u2019s a reference to continued work toward a multibillion-dollar mission to Europa, a jovian moon, in search of extraterrestrial life in its ice-covered oceans.>Indeed, that 1% decline at NASA might seem like manna from heaven compared to what environmental and climate scientists are expecting. Media have reported that Trump will request cuts of 40% in science programs at EPA and 26% to the main research arm of NOAA. The request is also likely to zero out several EPA and NOAA programs that fund competitive grants for university-based researchers. Mulvaney suggested such proposed cuts reflect the fact that those activities \u201cdon\u2019t align with the president\u2019s position on global warming and alternative energy\u201d technologies.>But those reductions aren\u2019t due only to the president\u2019s ideological distaste for that research. They also contribute to the $54 billion cut that Trump needs to offset his proposed rise in military spending, to $603 billion, in the 2018 fiscal year that begins 1 October. ", " >To reach that defense spending goal, however, Congress will need to agree to change to change a 2011 law, known as the Budget Control Act (BCA), that places binding caps on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, which accounts for roughly one-third of the $3.5 trillion that the federal government spends annually. (The other two-thirds goes to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, other kinds spending required by law, and paying interest on the national debt.) Changing the BCA could be a heavy political lift, however, requiring 60 votes in the Senate. And, in general, White House budget requests are just one of many factors that Congress considers as it exercises its constitutional authority to set spending levels. Lawmakers from both parties have already expressed skepticism about some of the cuts Trump has proposed, and the NIH cuts will likely face stiff opposition. Congress won\u2019t decide final numbers until late this year.

That's not a typo. That devastating increase is spelled out in the table below, in which the CBO models how premiums might change for Americans of different ages and incomes under the legislation Republicans have proposed. With Obamacare, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 per year in 2026\u2014175 percent of the poverty line\u2014would have to pay $1,700 for insurance, after tax credits.

There are two main reasons: Under Trumpcare, insurers would be allowed to charge older Americans more, while the government would give lower-income Americans smaller subsidies to pay for coverage. Currently, insurers are only allowed to charge older customers three times what they charge younger individuals. The Republican plan would allow them to charge five times as much. Meanwhile, under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government gives people tax credits based on their income and the cost of insurance, which cap premiums as a percentage of their earnings. Trumpcare's premiums are only based on age\u2014they don't take income or cost coverage into account\u2014so poorer households tend to lose out. They're also set to grow more slowly, which doesn't help matters.>There are some winners in this bargain. Obamacare doesn't offer premiums subsidies for households that earn more than 400 percent of the poverty line. So some middle- and upper-middle-income Americans may come out ahead. A 40-year-old making $68,200 in 2026 would pay $6,500 under Obamacare; with Trumpcare's tax credit, he'd pay just $2,400 for an insurance plan that was only slightly less comprehensive. A 21-year-old with the same salary would benefit similarly, while a 64-year-old would pay slightly less than under Obamacare. ", " >The CBO has often been criticized\u2014perhaps unfairly\u2014for its estimates about Obamacare's coverage effects. But its budgeteers were largely on target regarding the Affordable Care Act's effects on premiums. Republicans are already objecting that the office's estimate did not account for the way deregulation through the executive branch will bring down costs, by allowing insurers to sell less expansive policies. But that doesn't help older Americans with significant medical costs much. And as I mentioned before, these premium comparisons assume customers will buy far less comprehensive coverage. There's every reason to believe the projections on this table are at least directionally correct about what the effects of Trumpcare would be.>So you could call it a trade-off. Younger, higher-income Americans pay less, while older, poorer Americans\u2014many of whom are likely Trump supporters\u2014pay far, far more for less useful insurance. This is part of a bill, mind you, that would force many of these lower-income households into the individual market by cutting hundreds of billions from Medicaid.

His platoon commander started to tell the story of the video \u2014 a story that he has told dozens of times over the past two years. This time he picked it up at the moment when they were all standing over the Taliban fighters\u2019 blood-stained corpses, just before the camera began recording. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Piss on these guys,\u2019\u201d he was remembering. \u201cAnd someone else was like, \u2018Yeah, you know what, let\u2019s piss on them.\u2019\u201d>Richards\u2019s mother dropped her eyes, and he stopped telling the story.>\u201cI\u2019ve always been proud of you boys,\u201d she said.>The platoon commander took a gulp of his whiskey. \u201cYou had the pleasure of raising ...\u201d he said, searching for the right words.>Another Marine finished the thought: \u201cthe baddest Marine ever.\u201d>The next morning, a Marine in a dark overcoat held the ammo can with Richards\u2019s remains in two white-gloved hands and marched slowly toward the grave site. On one side of the metal box was a stencil of crossed rifles, superimposed over a skull that\u2019s been pierced by a sniper\u2019s bullet. On the other was a favorite Hemingway quote that his family had put there because it seemed to sum up Richards\u2019s life and his eventual death: \u201cThere is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.\u201d>The Marine set the box down on a small riser in front of Richards\u2019s mother, his wife and his grandfather, an 83-year-old combat veteran, clad on this day in his Army dress uniform. Behind them about 300 mourners had gathered.... ", " > A Navy chaplain stepped to the front and delivered another version of Richards\u2019s life. \u201cHe served with honor ... gave so much ... and bled for our freedom,\u201d the chaplain said. \u201cToday we lay him to rest in a fitting place.\u201d A volley of rifle fire delivered a salute followed by a lone bugler who sounded taps. An honor guard of Marines then folded an American flag that had been suspended over the ammo box into a tight triangle. Their movements were perfectly choreographed, precise and controlled; nothing like Richards\u2019s war.>Most Marines in Afghanistan rarely saw the enemy, who fired at them from behind walls or blasted them with pressure-triggered land mines. Snipers, such as Richards, were the exception. They stalked the Taliban, watching them for hours through their scopes as they planned attacks, shared meals and went about their day. \u201cEvery single mission we came back with multiple kills,\u201d said former Sgt. Edward Deptola, Richards\u2019s platoon sergeant. \u201cThere would be two, three, four, five, sometimes 15 kills.\u201d>There was a relentlessness to their war. But, on some days, there was also a joy to it. After shooting a Taliban fighter, Richards and Deptola would often slap hands. Sometimes Richards would do a little celebration dance. \u201cTo the average guy, you\u2019d look like a complete psychopath,\u201d Deptola said. Over there, he said, \u201cIt made perfect sense.\u201d>The down time between missions \u2014 recuperating and waiting for another assignment \u2014 was often the hardest part. \u201cWe\u2019d be like crack addicts,\u201d Deptola recalled. \u201cWe were on that adrenaline drug. We\u2019d get our high when we killed people, and the only way to get our high was to kill. We were honestly addicted to killing people.\u201d... ", " >The more Taliban they killed, the more praise they received from the top brass. The commandant of the Marine Corps set aside a morning to have breakfast with them and laud them for their work. Richards\u2019s commanders recognized his battlefield valor by nominating him for a Bronze Star.>On the day the video was filmed, the snipers had pushed out farther than ever before from their patrol base, searching for a cell of fighters who had killed one of their Marines and then hung one of his limbs from a tree, Deptola said.>The snipers were about 50 yards from the Taliban when they shot them. Seconds after the enemy fighters fell, a boy, who was standing with the men, grabbed a rifle and pointed it at the Marines. Richards shot the boy one time in the chest, wounding but not killing him. Usually, the Marines left the bodies of the Taliban fighters for the locals to bury. This time, perhaps because they were already so close, their commanders ordered them take the bodies back to their base so Marine Corps intelligence could search them, Deptola said.>The snipers were buzzing with joy, anger and adrenaline as they approached the enemy dead. Then came the moment just before the video. Then came the 38 seconds, and now several years later, Deptola was explaining why they decided to urinate on them.>\u201cBecause killing them wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t enough justice.\u201d... ", " >After the funeral, the mourners gathered at a bar in Georgetown. Richards\u2019s wife, Raechel, was talking with his company commander from his last Afghanistan tour. The Marine officer wasn\u2019t with Richards on the day the video was recorded, but it still ended his career. Richards often said that his only regret from the day was that his actions had compromised the careers of his superior officers.>\u201cHe\u2019s where he deserves to be,\u201d the officer told Raechel, before thinking twice about how his words must have sounded to a grieving widow. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I wish I could have done more.\u201d>She touched his arm to let him know it was okay.>Raechel was still in high school when she met her future husband, who had just graduated and was drifting half-heartedly through community college. He was restless, outgoing, romantic and impulsive. \u201cGoing to war was his purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what he was meant to do.\u201d>More than anyone else, she had seen the toll that combat had taken on her husband. After he was wounded during his second tour, Richards suffered from sleeplessness and night terrors. On a short vacation in Tampa, Fla., he had mistaken a sudden loud boom for an enemy attack and fired his pistol through a mirror in their hotel room.>Nine months after the incident, he turned down an instructor position at Marine sniper school and volunteered for his third tour. His wife begged his platoon commander to make him stay home and heal. \u201cHe may look like he\u2019s ready,\u201d she recalled saying. \u201cBut as his wife, as the person who sees him when he sleeps at night, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready.\u201d... ", " >The video appeared on the Internet a few weeks after Richards returned home from tour No. 3. \u201cWell it looks like I\u2019m going to be famous,\u201d he said a few hours after the video first surfaced on the TMZ gossip Web site. At that moment, Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigators were waiting to interview him.>As the months passed, Richards worried that the 38 seconds would follow him for the rest of his life. The investigation and court-martial took nearly two years before the Marine Corps offered Richards a plea deal that reduced him a rank to corporal and allowed him to leave the military with an honorable discharge. Richards felt abandoned by the Marine brass who had heaped praise on his unit when they were killing Taliban. He had hoped to get into defense contracting after the military, but he worried that no one in the industry would ever hire him.>\u201cHe felt backed into a corner,\u201d his wife recalled. \u201cHe always said, \u2018It\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be known for.\u2019\u201d>After the military, Richards fell into a depression and became addicted to opiates. Eventually, he went through drug counseling. He and his wife separated briefly and then reunited after he had finished treatment.>Their last few months together were some of the best of their marriage, Raechel was now telling his former company commander. \u201cHe was coming to terms with the fact that he was not going to be a Marine anymore and was going to have to be something else,\u201d she said. Nearby a Marine was passing out sniper rounds filled with locks of Richards\u2019s hair and gunpowder.>\u201cHe was finally coming to terms with it,\u201d she said again.>A few days before he died, Richards and his wife had put in an offer on a house near Orlando, where they both had attended high school. They had already begun to box up their possessions for the move from their home in Camp Lejeune, N.C.... ", " >On his last morning alive, Richards ordered books for the community college courses that he planned on taking in Florida. As his wife was rushing out the door to work, he playfully asked her to dance with him. She noticed that his hands were clammy and his skin was pale.>She came home from work that evening and found his body on the floor outside the kitchen. Later doctors would speculate that his weakened liver had been unable to metabolize the prescription painkillers that were slowly building up in his system.>There are many reactions to seeing death: Raechel\u2019s was disbelief. \u201cNot like this,\u201d she would remember screaming as she stood near her husband. \u201cNot like this.\u201d ", " This is why we have to be careful about knee-jerk reactions.The guy spent 3 combat tours being hunted by and hunting the Taliban, of course he's going to be resentful towards them.

The depictions outraged many Muslims, who consider such representations to be blasphemous.The controversy led to deadly riots, attacks on Danish embassies in the Middle East and a trade boycott against Denmark. But Danish prosecutors at the time refused to charge the newspaper\u2019s editors with blasphemy.The decision to charge the Quran burner was made by a regional prosecutor in Viborg, on the Jutland peninsula, and had to be approved by the country\u2019s attorney general.The blasphemy law has been invoked only a handful of times since its creation in 1866, most recently in 1971, when two people broadcast a song mocking Christianity and stirred a debate over female sexuality. They were acquitted.No one has been convicted of the crime since 1946, when a man dressed himself up as a priest and mock-baptized a doll at a masquerade ball.In the current case, the suspect, who was not identified by the authorities but called himself John Salvesen on Facebook, uploaded video footage of a Quran being burned in his backyard. In the 4-minute, 15-second clip, the clicking sounds of a lighter are heard before flames engulf the large leather-bound book.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/world/europe/denmark-quran-burning.html?_r=0 "}, "replies": [" >>119586The video was posted on Dec. 27, 2015, to a Facebook group called \u201cYes to Freedom \u2014 No to Islam.\u201d Above the video, shared 415 times, were the words: \u201cConsider your neighbor, it stinks when it burns.\u201d One commenter wrote: \u201cIf I had the Quran I\u2019d also burn it, that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019s good for. Gives a bit of heat.\u201dThe man\u2019s Facebook page was full of messages critical of Islam, refugees and women. In one post, he even wrote, \u201cI hate children.\u201dThe video did not get widespread attention at the time. The defendant \u2014 his true name is still not clear and under Danish law cannot be released unless he is convicted \u2014 was charged last year with hate speech, but the indictment was later changed to blasphemy, a decision prosecutors announced on Wednesday. A trial has been scheduled for June. If convicted, the defendant faces up to four months in prison or a fine.His lawyer, Rasmus Paludan, argued that his client had burned the Quran in \u201cself-defense.\u201d\u201cThe Quran contains passages on how Mohammed\u2019s followers must kill the infidel, i.e. the Danes,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s an act of self-defense to burn a book that in such a way incites war and violence.\u201dMr. Paludan also noted that in 1997, a Danish artist burned a copy of the Bible on a news show by a state broadcaster but was not charged. \u201cConsidering that it is legal to burn a Bible in Denmark, I\u2019m surprised then that it would be guilty to burn the Quran,\u201d he said in a phone interview.Mr. Paludan said his client \u201cloves freedom of expression and loves Denmark.\u201d Speculating on the decision to bring charges, he said, \u201cThe fear of Islam and Muslims may be far greater now, and the prosecution service may be a lot more apprehensive of Islam and its followers.\u201d ", " >>119588Jan Reckendorff, the regional prosecutor who brought the charge against Mr. Salvesen, said in a statement: \u201cIt is the prosecution\u2019s view that circumstances involving the burning of holy books such as the Bible and the Quran can in certain cases be a violation of the blasphemy clause, which covers public scorn or mockery of religion.\u201dJacob Mchangama, director of Justitia, a Danish civil liberties group, called the decision to file charges the latest sign of a declining respect for free speech in Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad development but one that mirrors developments elsewhere,\u201d he said.Mr. Mchangama said he thought the prosecutor was motivated by a desire to fend off the threat of terrorist attacks. \u201cDanish authorities are afraid that the Quran burning could spark a new crisis, and if they say that they\u2019ve actually charged this person, this is a way to appease or at least avoid such a crisis,\u201d he said.Blasphemy laws protect religious dogma from ridicule, and therefore the feelings of believers, Mr. Mchangama argues, while hate speech laws protect religious groups from degrading expressions.Denmark is one of only five countries in the European Union that has a blasphemy law on the books. Some say the case could lead to a rallying cry to abandon such laws once and for all.\u201cOne might speculate that this is one more straw on the back of the camel, so that more politicians will be in the favor of abolishing the law,\u201d said Per Mouritsen, a professor of political science at Aarhus University. Danes, he said, generally believe that \u201cMuslims should be able to stand up to ridicule as much as Christians would routinely put up with, and that everyone should take a joke.\u201dMr. Mouritsen, noting the 1997 decision not to prosecute, asked, \u201cWhy should this all of a sudden be an issue, when everybody agrees that the blasphemy law is a thing of the past?\u201d ", " >>119591The decision to press charges was condemned by the right-wing, anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s Party, which said it would push to rescind the blasphemy law.\u201cI\u2019m not going to recommend people burn either Qurans or Bibles, but it\u2019s a waste of public resources to spend time on such things,\u201d Peter Kofod Poulsen, the party\u2019s spokesman for legal affairs, told Ritzau, a Danish news agency. \u201cWe have more important things to busy ourselves with in 2017 than to take people to task over burning books.\u201dBut Trine Bramsen, a member of Parliament and a spokeswoman of the Social Democrats, an opposition party, defended the blasphemy law. \u201cI struggle to see how that we\u2019ll achieve a stronger society, or how we\u2019ll enrich the public debate, if the burning of holy books was permitted,\u201d she told Ritzau.The 2005 cartoon controversy was followed by deadly attacks that have left Western Europe deeply shaken.In 2010, Kurt Westergaard, who had drawn a cartoon for Jyllands-Posten that showed Muhammad with a bomb in a black turban, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, fleeing into a safe room at his home in the port city of Aarhus to escape a young Somali armed with an ax and a knife. In 2013, Lars Hedegaard, an outspoken critic of Islam and a defender of Lars Vilks, a Swedish cartoonist who had lampooned Muhammad, was shot at outside his Copenhagen home by a gunman disguised as a postal worker.In January 2015, 12 people died an assault on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had lampooned Islam. The next month, the police in Copenhagen shot and killed a man after he killed someone outside a synagogue and sprayed bullets into a cafe where Mr. Vilks, the Swedish cartoonist, was speaking.In Denmark, \u201cthe very idea that religion is taken seriously is the antithesis of being a good citizen,\u201d said Mr. Mouritsen, the political scientist. \u201cThis is very important.\u201d ", " And people wonder why there isn't a populist reaction in the western world.

He has travelled across the world and brought together global audiences for his method of Socratic dialogue.>Michael gathers an audience in a secondary school in Dagenham, East London, to address one of the most pressing issues of our times - the future of work in a world where automation threatens to replace more and more workers with robots. A much-cited Oxford University report predicts that 35% of jobs in the UK are at risk.>There is nowhere better to examine this issue than Dagenham, where once 40,000 people built cars at the famous Ford factory. The plant stopped making cars in 2002 and now makes vast numbers of car engines, but with fewer than 3,000 employees. Barking and Dagenham is judged by the Legatum Institute as the least prosperous borough in London and among the 10 least prosperous in the UK. The unemployment rate is one of the highest in London.

It was turned into a mosque in the 15th century after the Ottoman Turks defeated the Greek emperor in Constantinople and renamed the city Istanbul.

The team, formally known as DEVGRU,had taken part in some of the most high-profile operations in military history, including the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.>At the time of the 2001 9/11 attacks, Owens was in SEAL training, arguably the most physically grueling and mentally grinding regimens in the military. The team, tasked with tracking terrorists and mythologized in books and movies, had once been dubbed a \u201cglobal manhunting machine\u201d by the Times.>Despite the lore surrounding the SEALS\u2019 exploits, almost everything about them is kept secret, even their names.

While in the Reserves, Bill worked for Caterpillar tractor company, until he was laid off during the recession in the 1980s. Shortly thereafter, he saw a notice in a military magazine for new recruits for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, and he successfully applied.>Owens and his then-wife, Ryan\u2019s mother Patricia, moved with Ryan to South Florida. His elder sons remained with Owens\u2019 first wife in Illinois.>Despite the distance between them, the half-brothers were very close, Owens said.

It was later destroyed by a U.S. airstrike to prevent it from falling into militant hands.>Some reports have said as many as 23 civilians, including an 8-year-old girl, were killed.>Afterward, McCain characterized the mission as a failure, and Trump responded with a series of tweets defending the Yemen action, and criticizing McCain.

Trump and Russians \u2014 across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn\u2019t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.>American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials \u2014 and others close to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence.>Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates.>The disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d>Mr. Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he \u201cnever met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.\u201d>\u201cI have no idea what this allegation is about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is false.\u201d... "}, "replies": [" >Mr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and at one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the presidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping the Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration.>At the Obama White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements stoked fears among some that intelligence could be covered up or destroyed \u2014 or its sources exposed \u2014 once power changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow.>It also reflected the suspicion among many in the Obama White House that the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russia on election email hacks \u2014 a suspicion that American officials say has not been confirmed. Former senior Obama administration officials said that none of the efforts were directed by Mr. Obama.>Sean Spicer, the Trump White House spokesman, said, \u201cThe only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election.\u201d He added, \u201cThere continues to be no there, there.\u201d>As Inauguration Day approached, Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible inside government could see it, even if people without security clearances could not. Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators \u2014 including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election.... ", " >At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses, and to keep the reports at a relatively low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government \u2014 and, in some cases, among European allies. This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by American analysts to share information.>There was also an effort to pass reports and other sensitive materials to Congress. In one instance, the State Department sent a cache of documents marked \u201csecret\u201d to Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland days before the Jan. 20 inauguration. The documents, detailing Russian efforts to intervene in elections worldwide, were sent in response to a request from Mr. Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and were shared with Republicans on the panel.>\u201cThis situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama\u2019s call for a review \u2014 and as is evident by the United States response,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.\u201d>The opposite happened with the most sensitive intelligence, including the names of sources and the identities of foreigners who were regularly monitored. Officials tightened the already small number of people who could access that information. They knew the information could not be kept from the new president or his top advisers, but wanted to narrow the number of people who might see the information, officials said.... ", " Its on ", " >More than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret, making an independent public assessment of the competing Obama and Trump administration claims impossible.>The F.B.I. is conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, and is examining alleged links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and the Russian government. Separately, the House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting their own investigations, though they must rely on information collected by the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.>On Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Sessions had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak last year, when he was still a senator, despite testifying at his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russians. At that hearing, Mr. Sessions was asked what he would do if it turned out to be true that anyone affiliated with the Trump team had communicated with the Russian government in the course of the campaign. He said he was \u201cnot aware of any of those activities.\u201d>\u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians, and I\u2019m unable to comment on it,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at the time.>However, Justice officials acknowledged that Mr. Sessions had spoken with Mr. Kislyak twice: once, among a group of ambassadors who approached him at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and, separately, in an office meeting on Sept. 8. The contacts were first reported by The Washington Post.... ", " >Sarah Isgur Flores, Mr. Sessions\u2019s spokeswoman, said \u201cthere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer\u201d because he did not communicate with the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump campaign surrogate. She said Mr. Sessions had at least 25 conversations in 2016 with ambassadors from a range of nations \u2014 including Britain, Japan, China, Germany and Russia \u2014 while on the Senate Armed Services Committee.>The revelation prompted congressional Democrats to issue a torrent of statements reiterating their demands that Mr. Sessions recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Russia\u2019s contacts with the Trump campaign. So far, Mr. Sessions has demurred.>Representative Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that if the reports about Mr. Sessions were accurate, \u201cit is essential that he recuse himself from any role in the investigation of Trump campaign ties to the Russians.\u201d Mr. Schiff added, \u201cThis is not even a close call; it is a must.\u201d>Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, called on Mr. Sessions to resign, saying on Twitter that \u201che is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country.\u201d>A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, backed up Mr. Sessions late Wednesday, calling the accusations \u201cthe latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats.\u201d... ", " >At a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he did not know if there was anything between the Trump campaign and the Russians. But he added that if there was, \u201cit is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump.\u201d>At his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, former Senator Dan Coats, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that \u201cI think it\u2019s our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need.\u201d>Some Obama White House officials had little faith that a Trump administration would make good on such pledges, and the efforts to preserve the intelligence continued until the administration\u2019s final hours. This was partly because intelligence was still being collected and analyzed, but it also reflected the sentiment among many administration officials that they had not recognized the scale of the Russian campaign until it was too late.>The warning signs had been building throughout the summer, but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, American intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Mr. Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries.>But what was going on in the meetings was unclear to the officials, and the intercepted communications did little to clarify matters \u2014 the Russians, it appeared, were arguing about how far to go in interfering in the presidential election. What intensified the alarm at the Obama White House was a campaign of cyberattacks on state electoral systems in September, which led the administration to deliver a public accusation against the Russians in October.... ", " >But it wasn\u2019t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.But it wasn\u2019t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.>In the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information \u2014 some of which was months old by then \u2014 and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials.>The nature of the contacts remains unknown. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates have done business in Russia, and it is unclear if any of the contacts were related to business dealings.>The New York Times, citing four current and former officials, reported last month that the American authorities had obtained information of repeated contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and senior Russian intelligence officials. The White House has dismissed the story as false.>Since the Feb. 14 article appeared, more than a half-dozen officials have confirmed contacts of various kinds between Russians and Trump associates. The label \u201cintelligence official\u201d is not always cleanly applied in Russia, where ex-spies, oligarchs and government officials often report back to the intelligence services and elsewhere in the Kremlin.... ", " >Steven L. Hall, the former head of Russia operations at the C.I.A., said that Mr. Putin was surrounded by a cast of characters, and that it was \u201cfair to say that a good number of them come from an intelligence or security background. >The concerns about the contacts were cemented by a series of phone calls between Mr. Kislyak and Michael T. Flynn, who had been poised to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The calls began on Dec. 29, shortly after Mr. Kislyak was summoned to the State Department and informed that, in retaliation for Russian election meddling, the United States was expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives and imposing other sanctions. Mr. Kislyak was irate and threatened a forceful Russia response, according to people familiar with the exchange.>But a day later, Mr. Putin said his government would not retaliate, prompting a Twitter post from Mr. Trump praising the Russian president \u2014 and puzzling Obama White House officials.>On Jan. 2, admin. officials learned that Mr. Kislyak \u2014 after leaving the State Department meeting \u2014 called Mr. Flynn, and that the two talked multiple times in the 36 hours that followed. American intelligence agencies routinely wiretap the phones of Russian diplomats, and transcripts of the calls showed that Mr. Flynn urged the Russians not to respond, saying relations would improve once Mr. Trump was in office, according to multiple current and former officials.>Beyond leaving a trail for investigators, the Obama administration also wanted to help European allies combat a threat that had caught the US off guard. American intelligence agencies made it clear in the declassified version of the intelligence assessment released in January that they believed Russia intended to use its attacks on the United States as a template for more meddling. \u201cWe assess Moscow will apply lessons learned,\u201d the report said, \u201cto future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies.\u201d "]}, "116572": {"op": {"timestamp": 1488409200, "title": "Fuck", "comment": " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans "}, "replies": [" this is not news "]}, "116363": {"op": {"timestamp": 1488322800, "title": "Brian D.

The basic science behind it is that you put a bump going across the road, and paint it with clear warning markers, like yellow stripes, and if a car hits it going too fast, they fuck their vehicle up. We use them in neighborhoods, parking lots, etc. imo, speed bumps tend to work a bit better than a little girl with a hair dryer, but go with what you've got, I guess. ", " >>115348There's a few problems with speed bumps (and humps for the oversize version) that prevents them from being widely used:1. Snow clearance. Snow plows and other clearing devices can get stuck or damaged when hitting a speed bump, so cleaning streets that have them can be a slow process. Obviously not a problem in regions that never (or rarely) get snow, but it's a thing to consider in regions that do.2. Lower than listed speed. Speed humps in my area are rated for 15mph (so you can safely do, say, 20mph), which limits their deployment on higher-speed roads (the humps in my area are on a 25mph road), since the temporary slowdown can cause congestion or accidents if the differential between the bump and the road is too high.3. Low-clearance vehicles. Speed humps don't work well with vehicles that ride low to the ground (I had a friend who literally couldn't cross the humps near my house, he had to drive around them on a different street). This isn't a problem when local ordinance prevents said low clearance, and such vehicles are pretty limited in general, but it is a regional consideration. Also, I believe traditional bumps have less of a problem with this.You also need to get these things approved by the department of transportation or whoever runs the local road network, but that's a given for any official solution vs hairdryers and fake speed cameras.

Then when the really heinous stuff comes out, the stuff that would sink any other politician's career, their share of the electorate remains more amenable to their side.What's worrying about this is that his continued use of this strategy would suggest there is possibly more heinous stuff to be uncovered or even planned.

To my understanding, it's important for the news media to research and explain all significant current events using properly sourced evidence and providing complete context.News sometimes contains misinformation but it's not something I see happening commonly enough (except in science journalism) and with enough or a clear agenda to auggest conspiracy. People have opinions. News anchors have opinions. On MSNBC they tend liberal, and on Fox they tend conservative. But where are all of these glaring lies and manufactured incidents?

Party realignments aren't unheard of. ", " >>105054The logic and frame of mind comes from the media intentionally wording things in a way as to provoke outrage or force an ideology. You only need to look at them having photoshopped photos of Zimmerman to be paler so that they could play up racial tensions. The term White Hispanic is another example. They play up racial angles to keep you idiots from looking at the real disparity in your country. Class. They're happy to talk about every time a black man was shot by a white cop, when was the last time they talked about the white hobo who was beaten to death by police officers while he screamed for his parents to save him? Police brutality, a serious fucking issue in your country, is spoken about them only enough for them to get black people and white people mad at each other, rather than mad at an establishment that treats them both like mud.Or the fact that in their attempt to make Trump look like a joke, they gave him the biggest platform the world had ever seen. They posted everything he said thinking it would make him look like a big meanie-bo-beanie and thus nobody would ever vote for him. They completely ignored the fact that the middle of America fucking openly despises all notions of political correctness, and that Clinton was highly unpopular outside the places that would vote for her simply because she has a twat. They're completely out of touch with anyone who doesn't think like them, and helped the most impossible president ever be elected.You can look at the way they gloss over American fuck-ups in Syria, you can look at how anything that doesn't fit the narrative is ignored.Frankly I wish I could post that image of the Time magazines from around the world, where it shows the international ones featuring stories about world politics, while the American ones were patriotic drivel and fucking fluff.

Back to /pol/ ", " >>105246It's one thing to argue that media sometimes acts irresponsibly or shows bias. and something else entirely to argue that there exists a concerted campaign of disinformation designed to lead the audience to favor a particular narrative. A mass conspiracy requires evidence of some underlying cooperation. Fox News has in multiple instances photoshoped faces of other journalists.Multiple news outlets tending to favor one particular reading of events or providing coverage that sheds more of a positive light on one political faction than another might likely be a matter of pure coincidence. One worldview tends to feature greater congruence with reality. One party tends to favor a more realistic worldview.And of course, there's the matter of some subjectivity in media. If liberals tend to live on the east coast, and more journalists tend to graduate from colleges on the east coast, then more journalists will tend to be liberal. No conspiracy required for explanation.Free press isn't a guarantee that every perspective will be given its fair share of coverage on all medias; it is up to individuals to exercise their rights to provide the coverage they see missing from the dialectic. And it is the ultimate responsibility of the electorate to think critically and neutrally, check sources, and generally exercise sound judgement. Middle America may hate PC news coverage; but it's generally irresponsible to let your personal feelings toward the source of information, or the manner in which it is framed, drive your affinity for a particular narrative. ", " >>105422to continue: To this effect I see outlets as Fox News and Breitbart step up to provide coverage of a conservative bent, from a perspective to which the Middle American demographic can relate more toward.

The monkey ejaculated on the backs of the does, which licked the seminal fluid, researchers said.\"No ambiguity is possible, it is clearly sexual behaviour,\" study co-author Marie Pele of the University of Strasbourg, France, told AFP.Furthermore, the monkey appeared to \"guard\" the targets of its affection, chasing away other male macaques.The scientists speculated the behaviour may be driven by \"mate deprivation\" in a community where competition for females is stiff, boosted by a surge of hormones in the breeding season.\"Sometimes young males, like the one in the study, do not have access to females in their social group as these are claimed by older males,\" said Pele.\"This young macaque... did not have access to females, but was very excited.

This all suggest to me that expression and performance (behavior) on intelligence tests have more to do with production of the right answers, rather than actually being capable of figuring out the answer - with more time, and study, most people can adjust their neurological innateness to adjust for. See, intelligence is about management of mind.It's about the approach and consideration of thought while thinking, just as much as getting the question correct. Intelligence testing is a measure but what's happening in a test is a PROCESS. Therefore, 'Adaptive behaviors' adjusted for 'better thinking' patterns (behavior) will lead to better thinking as a habit in time, making management of 'new information' a compounding factor, and a person 'smarter' performing in time.IQ, after all, currently increases three points every decade. that's one SD every generation. It's simply adjusted for the ever increasingly intelligent more learned (more learned to think) community. It's not that people are becoming biologically smarter, it's that civilization has in place institutions to train how to think better. this is seen in the rearing of Jewish and Han Chinese children in their early years by ridged intellectual [cultural] modelling. This is why most people can attend college, and then there are those who finish college.

Lauderdale Airport shooter is a Muslim convert who years before joining the U.S. Army took on an Islamic name (Aashiq Hammad), downloaded terrorist propaganda and recorded Islamic religious music online, according to public records dug up by the investigative news site of an award-winning, California journalist. This is pertinent information that the Obama administration apparently wants to keep quiet, bringing up memories of the Benghazi cover up, in which the president and his cohorts knowingly lied to conceal that Islamic terrorists attacked the U.S. Special Mission in Libya.Information is slowly trickling out that links the Ft. Lauderdale Airport shooter to radical Islam while the official story from authorities is that the gunman is a mentally ill, Hispanic Army veteran named Esteban Santiago that became unhinged after a tour in Iraq. Only one mainstream media outlet mentions the possibility of Santiago\u2019s \u201cjihadist identity,\u201d burying it in a piece about New York possibly being his initial target. A paragraph deep in the story mentions that investigators recovered Santiago\u2019s computer from a pawn shop and the FBI is examining it to determine whether he created a \u201cjihadist identity for himself using the name Aashiq Hammad\u2026\u201d The reset of the traditional mainstream media coverage promotes the government rhetoric that omits any ties to terrorism even though early on a photo surfaced of Santiago making an ISIS salute while wearing a keffiyeh, a Palestinian Arab scarf.The public records uncovered in the days after the massacre suggest Santiago (Hammad) is a radical Islamic terrorist that\u2019s seriously committed to Islam. Besides taking on a Muslim name, he recorded three Islamic religious songs, including the Muslim declaration faith (\u201cthere is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger\u201d) known as the Shahada.http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2017/01/airport-shooter-converted-islam-identified-aashiq-hammad-years-joining-army/ "}, "replies": [" He also posted a thread about downloading propaganda videos from Islamic terrorists on a weapons and explosives forum. The investigative news site that unearthed this disturbing information connected the dots between Santiago, who is of Puerto Rican descent, and Hammad, an identity he created in 2007.This week a prominent Ft. Lauderdale businessman and longtime resident addressed a letter to the city\u2019s mayor and commissioners blasting county and federal officials for covering up that \u201cAashiq Hammad, not Esteban Santiago, attacked our city and county.\u201d The businessman, respected Ft. Lauderdale real estate entrepreneur Jim Morlock, specifically names Broward County\u2019s elected sheriff Scott Israel, Florida senator Bill Nelson, the first to identify Santiago as the shooter on national television, and congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, ousted last summer as Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair over a scandalous plot to damage Bernie Sanders during the primary.\u201cSince when does a US Senator (Bill Nelson), not law enforcement, be the one to so quickly release this terrorist\u2019s Hispanic name but nothing about his more relevant Islamic background?\u201d the letter asks. Obama must have told Sen. Nelson to keep this from looking like a Muslim Terrorist attack during the last 12 days of his watch. Bad for his legacy.\u201d Morlock goes on to state that it\u2019s \u201cbetter to portray this atrocity as white Hispanic Alaskan mental Iraq war vet gun violence.\u201d The real estate entrepreneur proceeds to reveal that Santiago lives in walking distance to the only mosque in Alaska, was radicalized before he entered the military and was knowingly allowed to serve despite his Islamic sympathies thanks to \u201cObama\u2019s PC military.\u201d ", " The letter poses interesting questions, including why this Muslim terrorist chose Ft. Lauderdale out of all the nation\u2019s airports and who Santiago knows in Broward county, which has a large and growing Islamic community. In 2015 Judicial Watch obtained records from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) that show and Al Qaeda terrorist who helped plan several U.S. attacks lived in Broward County and graduated from the local community college with a degree in computer engineering. His name is Adnan G. El Shukrijumah, but he also had a Hispanic identity, Javier Robles, and for years he appeared on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list. Back in 2012 Judicial Watch reported on a terrorist front group\u2019s demands that Broward County public schools close twice a year to celebrate Islamic holy days, illustrating the influence that Muslims have in the region.

The video was shot at one of these educational events, according to Viral Nova. Bubba was rescued from the Chicago area and is over 8ft long and weighs over 90kg, according to the company\u2019s website.The short clip, which has attracted almost 30,000 YouTube views, is entitled Katie Rides An Alligator and has been making waves online after re-emerging recently, although it was shot in 2013.The shocking video begins with the reptile pacing slowly along a mat, seemingly weighed down by the child on its back.A trainer tells the girl of around seven-years-old to put her thumbs up so that her mother can take a photograph.But as the creature lies on the ground, the anxious child leaps off it at the first opportunity.She is coaxed by the adults to sit back on the alligator for the camera.The youngster poses with her thumbs up but is carried away by the creature as it veers away from the spectator trying to take her photograph.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-4094924/What-possibly-wrong-Shocking-video-young-child-riding-8ft-ALLIGATOR-sweeps-internet.html "}, "replies": [" Katie smiles, the animal flashes its teeth and hilarity ensues among the off camera audience.

Such foolhardy behaviour risks a child's life, and this child's parents should be reported to social services.'Since alligators are deadly predators, common sense tells us that it's dangerous and witless to place children on their backs.
