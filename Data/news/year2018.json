It was the night before the third government shutdown of the year, when all through the House not a Democrat was stirring, not willing to budge.So President Donald Trump went on Twitter and criticized them for blocking his efforts to secure $5 billion for a border wall. He did so while saying he cancelled his winter getaway to Mar-a-Lago (where he was expected to be for 16 days) and by posing next to a large pile of bills that he was set on signing, starting with the one sitting on his desk.  Twitter users were quick to note, however, that that bill seemed empty. Zooming in on the picture, it is hard to tell whether the bill is actually blank because of the image's light conditions.  Other users pointed out that the number of bills on the desk didn't match the number of laws passed by the president that day which, according to govtrack.us, was two.

But Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani says talks between the two camps aren\u2019t over.https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-giuliani-negotiations-for-a-muller-trump-interview-are-still-openDonald Trump has already answered a number of Robert Mueller\u2019s questions. But the president may not be done supplying information to the Special Counsel\u2019s office, The Daily Beast has learned.Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for Trump, confirmed to The Daily Beast that the Trump and Mueller camps are continuing to negotiate over whether the special counsel will further question the president\u2014and the scope of those queries, should they take place.Regarding talks over Mueller\u2019s access to President Trump, Giuliani said that negotiations are \u201cstill open.\u201dAsked by The Daily Beast if it is his understanding that Mueller is still looking to interview Trump over the phone or in person, Giuliani reiterated that \u201cit hasn\u2019t been formally closed yet, and that the loop hasn\u2019t been closed.\u201dHe added that no specific dates have been set yet to resume talks. The former New York City mayor and current Trump attorney, however, said on Fox News Sunday earlier this month that his client would sit for an in-person Mueller interview \u201cover my dead body.\u201d Giuliani added, cheekily, \u201cBut, you know, I could be dead.\u201dA spokesperson for Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.CNN reported earlier this month that Mueller still wants to question the president. A source close to the investigation told The Daily Beast that Trump\u2019s lawyers uniformly advise the president that under no circumstances should he agree to a sit-down. Trump has for months told people close to him that he hasn\u2019t made a final decision on this yet, though none of the four sources close to Trump who spoke to The Daily Beast for this story expect Trump to willingly submit himself for an interview at this point.

There are other lawyers involved, and the president of the United States, of course\u2026My opinion is, I don\u2019t trust them. I look at how they treated Manafort, Flynn, and Corsi.\u201dPaul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chief, admitted in September that he had committed a number of crimes, including bank fraud, illegal foreign lobbying, and money laundering. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI; he has since cooperated with the Mueller probe, and will be sentenced next year. And Jerome Corsi, a conservative writer and leading propagator of the birther conspiracy theory, has drawn scrutiny from Mueller\u2019s team but has not been charged with any crime. Corsi and his lawyers have shared information with Trump\u2019s attorneys.The question of whether Trump will speak in person with lawyers on Mueller\u2019s team has been central ever since Mueller started his probe on May 17, 2017. And while the White House provided reams of documents to Mueller\u2019s team and made a host of senior staff available for interviews, Trump\u2019s lawyers have been loath to let him talk with the special counsel. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein initiated the probe shortly after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey (a move he later said was informed by the FBI\u2019s scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 race). He directed Mueller to investigate Kremlin efforts to impact that contest as well as any connection between Trump associates and Russian actors. Rosenstein oversaw the probe while Jeff Sessions\u2014a top Trump campaign adviser\u2014was attorney general. ", " Last month, Trump forced out Sessions and replaced him with Matt Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney who made a host of cable news appearances criticizing the Russia probe before joining the Trump administration. Whitaker has decided not to recuse himself from overseeing the probe, which means he is now Mueller\u2019s boss. The probe now appears to be entering a later phase; a number of prosecutors have left Mueller\u2019s team to return to their old jobs, and the special counsel is working on a report detailing the probe\u2019s findings. Mueller will give that report to the attorney general \u2013\u2013 likely to be Whitaker or Bill Barr, who Trump has picked for the job.Barr has made no secret of his view of the Mueller probe. Before Trump named him as his pick for attorney general, he wrote a memo for the Justice Department arguing that the special counsel was pushing for an \u201cunprecedented expansion\u201d of laws barring obstruction of justice, which could have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for the White House.

So that opens the window for not only Cohen lying about the Trump tower Moscow meeting, but Prague.

All Mueller can normally do is give his report to the AG and congress who then decide what to do with it. That was the case with Nixon, was used for his impeachment before he resigned. For Trump it's different because AG is clearly hostile and the republicans in the Senate will never vote to convict even if there is a smoking gun out of fear of Trump's base.

Among the 25-to-54-year-old demo most coveted by advertisers, he\u2019s down 30 percent. Competitors Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and Chris Cuomo on CNN are up in each measurement.Maddow has been beating Hannity outright in December, a turnaround from October. During that month, when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation drama dominated the news, Hannity\u2019s audience routinely exceeded Maddow\u2019s by about a million people each night, Nielsen said.\u201cI think it\u2019s a reflection of the mood of his audience,\u201d said Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of Hofstra University\u2019s communications school and a longtime NBC executive. \u201cThey can\u2019t be happy with what is coming out of Washington every day.\u201dHannity has been associated with Trump perhaps more than any other media figure.

Her ratings steadily improved as her show became a destination for Trump opponents.Ken LaCorte, a former Fox News executive who spent 20 years at the network, cautioned against reading too much into a few weeks of ratings. Pulling back for a broader view, Hannity\u2019s show will be the most popular on cable news for the second year in a row, with an average of 3.3 million viewers that is up 17 percent over 2017, according to Nielsen.It\u2019s certainly possible that Republicans have been less interested in the news lately, said LaCorte, who is launching a news web site, LaCortenews.com, next month .\u201cIt\u2019s probably more interesting to hear about the party you support taking over the House of Representatives because there are more interesting things to discuss,\u201d he said.Hannity also has company.

Fox News Channel is the top-rated network for all of basic cable for the third year in a row, topping ESPN, and will finish with the highest-rated prime-time schedule in its history.

No.When israel is giving back to the Palestinians and jews forbidden to live in Palestine will other countries really want them settled in theirs? Highly unlikely. But for many years those who served in the IDF will be made to live in Gaza and the West Bank in the same conditions they forced the Palestinians in, to rebuild that Lans as punishment.

Rather, it's designed to make sure key market participants are communicating about critical issues. One reason why Mnuchin's move may have caused a measure of alarm \u2014 the last time the Plunge Protection Team played a prominent role was during the financial crisis a decade ago. >Mnuchin's appeal to the PWG also came as he sought to reassure financial markets by saying he'd spoken this weekend with the CEOs of six big U.S. banks -- a move that analysts said seemed to backfire. The Dow lost more than 650 points Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also continued their descent after tumbling last week. >\"These actions seem to raise more questions than answers -- especially as no one had seemed to raise any concerns related to these issues,\" Raymond James analyst Ed Mills said in a note to clients....

That left them surrounded by Kurds who were our allies and were doing most of the heavy lifting, and who now know that the US is betraying them and leaving them to die. That's going to create more than a little resentment. At the same time, both ISIS and the Syrian government found out about the withdrawal just as everyone else did, and they could easily move to take advantage of the situation. Even if you support pulling troops out of Syria, this was the worst possible way to go about doing it.On top of that, this whole thing is because Erdogan said \"I want you to retreat so I can kill your allies\" and Trump's response was just a meek \"okay, whatever you say, sir.\" Who is going to want to work with the US after that? When it's clear that the US will just let any strongman push the President around and talk him into letting them kill US allies, who will be willing to listen to anything the US says?People criticized Obama for being weak on the world stage, but Trump is a fucking joke.

Ginsburg fractured three ribs during the fall, but was back at work only a few days later.Critically, doctors said there is no evidence the disease spread beyond her lungs \u2014 a development that could have precipitously cut the odds of survival.Ginsburg said last Saturday during an appearance in New York that her health was fine and her ribs were almost fully recovered, and the Friday announcement from the court was her first public acknowledgment of the disease.\u201cThe implication would be that this is localized to the lung, and therefore it may very well be stage one,\u201d said Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer at the American Lung Association. \u201cThat tends to imply it\u2019s a localized disease, and it\u2019s just a matter of recovering from the surgery.\u201d "}, "replies": [" Most lung cancer patients survive the disease if it\u2019s caught early, as it appears is the case with Ginsburg.

He ended it by announcing the exit of the man U.S. allies see as the last guardrail against the president\u2019s erratic behavior: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump\u2019s worldview.At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency \u2014 and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right \u2014 Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.The president\u2019s decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump\u2019s coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a \u201cgutless president\u201d and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.After campaigning on shrinking America\u2019s footprint in overseas wars, Trump abruptly declared Wednesday that he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, a move Mattis and other advisers counseled against. And officials said Thursday that Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan, as well.The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas. Trump and his aides had signaled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists. "}, "replies": [" Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, \u201cWe\u2019re in a constant state of chaos right now in this country.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile it may satisfy [Trump\u2019s] need for attention, it\u2019s raising hell with the country.\u201dPanetta said the resignation of Mattis is a singular moment and that his letter, which underscores how Mattis sees Trump\u2019s approach as misguided, \u201cputs the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.\u201dTrump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers, and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an intervention,\u201d one former senior administration official said speculatively. \u201cJim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He\u2019s the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He\u2019s the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.\u201dIn his resignation letter, Mattis wrote, \u201cMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues ... Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201dAlthough Trump\u2019s relationship with Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of Thursday focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.On Thursday, as criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan but was spoiling for a fight. By midday, the president picked one. ", " \u201cI\u2019ve made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,\u201d Trump said Thursday. He added that he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to act.Trump\u2019s advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late Thursday but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), habitually careful in his approach to Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding probably would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions. At every turn, McConnell confided to Trump that congressional efforts this month \u2014 from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal justice reform \u2014 were a string of victories for him, the people said.Thanks to McConnell\u2019s soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. \u201cMcConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,\u201d Rep. Harold D. Rogers (R-Ky.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s smart to save the fight for another day.\u201dHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office \u2014 followed McConnell\u2019s playbook, pointing out how Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to Ryan said.Both Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Trump last week that they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and McConnell was told by the White House that Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations. ", " But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned that caving would jeopardize his reelection.Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as \u201cTrump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything.\u201d Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled \u201cGutless President in Wall-less Country.\u201d Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favorite show, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air Thursday.The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also assuming a defensive posture. He suggested that a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is \u201ctight\u201d thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.\u201cOne of the things he\u2019s most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Trump that he was being led astray.At an Oval Office meeting Thursday with Ryan and McCarthy, Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and \u201cdug in on what he wants,\u201d said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Ryan and McCarthy talking about \u201csteel slats\u201d and saying that the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a \u201cwall,\u201d as the president has done for more than three years. ", " The administration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November\u2019s midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Trump\u2019s finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.Meanwhile, Republicans, in their last gasp of unified government, are divided. A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Trump\u2019s prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president Friday. And many foreign policy hawks, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant, sharply criticized Trump\u2019s decision Wednesday to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as \u201ca tailspin,\u201d acting \u201ctotally irrationally\u201d and \u201cflipping out\u201d over criticisms in the media.Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers of paychecks over Christmas, Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers that they all would get \u201ccrushed\u201d if they did not get the wall built.Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise. He also complained that he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides for not presenting him with better options.\u201cHe\u2019s legitimately saying, \u2018This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?\u2019 \u201d said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. \u201cIf you\u2019re the outsider, you don\u2019t want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn\u2019t look like an outsider.\u201d ", " Trump urged aides to go on TV on Thursday night and defend the administration after a brutal day. Senior adviser Stephen Miller went on CNN, where he engaged in a long shouting match with anchor Wolf Blitzer. And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared with a Trump favorite, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs.Marc Short, Trump\u2019s former White House legislative affairs director, said Trump \u201cfeels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realization that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.\u201dTrump\u2019s pinballing conduct \u2014 veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving toward a deal, then changing his mind \u2014 has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense that Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of a soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.The defense secretary\u2019s resignation compounded the concern.\u201cHaving Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,\u201d retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said. \u201cChaos has kind of been the norm, but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it\u2019s got to settle, and then another thing happens.\u201d ", " >>330498Copy pasting the whole fucking article still doesn't make it less of a shill post faggot.

S. Treasury.The federal government could make a Rolls Royce affordable for every American, but we would not be a richer country as a result. We would in fact be a much poorer country, because of all the vast resources transferred from other economic activities to subsidize an extravagant luxury.Of course it might be nice to be sitting at the wheel of a Rolls Royce, but we might be sitting there in rags and tatters, and gaunt with hunger, after having squandered enormous amounts of labor, capital, and costly materials that could have been put to better use elsewhere. That doesn\u2019t happen in a market economy because most of us take one look at the price tag on a Rolls Royce and decide that it is time for another Toyota.The very notion of making things affordable misses the key point of a market economy. An economy exists to make trade-offs, and a market economy makes the terms of those trade-offs plain with price tags representing the relative costs of producing different things. To have politicians arbitrarily change the price tags, so that prices no longer represent the real costs, is to defeat the whole purpose.Reality doesn\u2019t change when the government changes price tags. Talk about \u201cbringing down health care costs\u201d is not aimed at the costly legal environment in which medical science operates, or other sources of needless medical costs. It is aimed at price control, which hides costs rather than reducing them.Hidden costs continue to take their toll\u2014 and it is often a higher toll than when these costs are freely transmitted through the marketplace. Less Supply, poorer quality, and longer waits have been the consequences of price Controls for all sorts of goods and services, in all sorts of societies, and for thousands of years of human history. ", " >>328817Why would anyone think that price controls on medical care would be any different, except for being more deadly in their consequences?One of the political excuses for making things affordable is that a particular product or service is a \u201cright.\u201d But this is only explaining one question-begging word with another.Although it has been proclaimed that \u201chealth care is a right, not a privilege,\u201d this neat dichotomy ignores the vast territory in between, where most decisions are made as trade-offs.If health insurance is a right and not a privilege\u2014 and not even a subject of incremental trade-offs\u2014 then the same should be even more true of food. History in fact shows all too many instances of governments trying to keep food affordable, usually with disastrous consequences.Whether in France during the 1790s, the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik revolution, or in newly independent African nations during the past generation, governments have imposed artificially low prices on food. In each case, this led to artificially low supplies of food and artificially high levels of hunger.Why do we go through this whole rigmarole of passing around dollar bills and writing each other checks, except to force everyone to economize on the country\u2019s inherently limited resources?What about \u201cbasic necessities\u201d? Shouldn\u2019t they be a \u201cright\u201d?The idea certainly sounds nice. But the very fact that we can seriously entertain such a notion, as if we were God on the first day of creation, instead of mortals constrained by the universe we find in place, shows the utter unreality of failing to understand that we can only make choices among alternatives actually available.For society as a whole, nothing comes as a \u201cright\u201d to which we are \u201centitled.\u201d Even bare subsistence has to be produced\u2014 and produced at a cost of heavy toil for much of human history. ", " >>328819The only way anyone can have a right to something that has to be produced is to force someone else to produce it for him. The more things are provided as rights, the less the recipients have to work and the more others have to carry their load.That does not mean more goods are available than under ordinary market production, but less. To believe otherwise is to commit the Rolls Royce fallacy on a more mundane level.For the government to make some things more affordable is to make other things less affordable\u2014 and to destroy people\u2019s freedom to make their own trade-offs as they see fit, in the light of economic realities, rather than political visions. Trade-offs remain inescapable, whether they are made through a market or through politics. The difference is that price tags present all the trade-offs simultaneously, while political \u201caffordability\u201d policies arbitrarily fix on whatever is hot at the moment.

Governments impose price controls, in order to try to keep the costs of medical care from absorbing so much of their budgets as to seriously restrict other government functions. Government-paid medical care is thus often an exercise in price control, and it creates situations that have been common for centuries in response to price controls on many other goods and services.One of the reasons for the political popularity of price controls in general is that part of their costs are concealed\u2014or, at least, are not visible initially when such laws are passed. Price controls are therefore particularly appealing to those who do not think beyond stage one\u2014which can easily be a majority of the voters. Artificially lower prices, created by government order rather than by supply and demand, encourage more use of goods or services, while discouraging the production of those same goods and services. Increased consumption and reduced production mean a shortage.Even the visible shortages do not tell the whole story, however. Quality deterioration often accompanies reduced production, whether what is being produced is food, housing, or numerous other goods and services whose prices have been kept artificially low by government fiat. Quality declines because the incentives to maintaining quality are lessened by price control. Sellers in general maintain the quality of their products or services for fear of losing customers otherwise. ", " But, when price controls create a situation where the amount demanded is greater than the amount supplied\u2014a shortage\u2014fear of losing customers is no longer as strong an incentive. Nowhere has quality deterioration been more apparent\u2014or more dangerous\u2014than with price controls on medical care. One way in which the quality of health care deteriorates is in the amount of time that a doctor spends with a patient. This was most dramatically demonstrated in the Soviet Union, which had the most completely government-controlled medical system:At the neighborhood clinics where 80% of all patients are treated, the norms call for physicians to see eight patients an hour. That is 7.5 minutes per visit, and Soviet studies show that five minutes of each visit is spent on paper work, a task complicated by chronic short supplies of preprinted forms and the absence of computers. \"Our heads spin from rushing,\" say Pavel, the silver-haired chief of traumatology at a Moscow clinic, who, like some other Russians interviewed for this article, won't give his last name. A dozen patients with splints and slings sit in a dark corridor awaiting their turn at a 1950s-vintage fluoroscope. \"We wind up seeing the same patients several times over,\" the doctor goes on, \"when one thorough examination could have solved the problem if we had the time.\" lthough the Soviet Union was an extreme example, similar policies have tended to produce similar results in other countries. Under government-paid health care in Japan, patients also have shorter and more numerous visits than patients in the United States. Under a Korean health care system copied from Japan, a study found that \"even injections of drugs were often split in half to make two visits necessary,\" because \"the doctor can charge for two office visits and two injection fees.\" ", " After Canada's Quebec province created its own government health plan back in the 1970s, telephone consultations went down, office visits went up and the time per visit went down. In other words, medical conditions which neither the doctor nor the patient previously thought serious enough to require an office visit, before price controls, now took up more time by both the patient (in travel time) and the doctor (in the office), thereby reducing the time available to people who had more serious conditions. In general, where the doctor is paid per patient visit, then a series of treatments that might have taken five visits to the doctor's office can now take ten shorter visits\u2014or more. Therefore political leaders can proclaim that price controls have succeeded because the cost per visit is now lower than it was in a free market, even though the total costs of treating a given illness have not declined and\u2014 typically\u2014have risen. Skyrocketing costs, far beyond anything projected at the outset, have marked government-controlled health care systems in France, Britain, Canada and elsewhere. Responses to such runaway costs have included abbreviated doctors' visit and hospital stays cut short.The costs in Britain's government-run medical system have increased sharply, both absolutely and as a percentage of the country's rising Gross Domestic Product. The National Health Service in Britain absorbed just under four percent of the country's GDP in 1960 and rose over the years until it absorbed well over seven percent of a larger GDP by 2000. Nevertheless, the number of doctors per capita in Britain was just half as many as in Germany, where half the hospital beds were still in private hands, despite a large role for government financing there. ", " Quality deterioration is another response to rising medical care costs. According to the British magazine The Economist, \"patients in other rich countries can get prompt treatment with state-of-the-art technologies in clean rather than dirty wards.\" Apparently not in Britain, where quality deterioration is part of the hidden cost that does not show up in statistics. More of anything tends to be demanded at a lower price\u2014and especially when it is free. In Canada as well, a news story pointed out: \"Since the system sets no limits on demand, patients seek as much care as they can get, driving up costs.\" In Britain, a twelve-year-old girl received a breast implant, paid for by the National Health Service. Excessive prescriptions were reported as \"routine\" under China's government-provided health care and patients there \"leave the dispensary with bags, rather than bottles, full of pills.\" China has subsequently moved away from government-provided medical care. Not only patients, but doctors as well, have incentives to use medical treatments more extensively when the government pays the bills. Many diseases can be treated in a variety of ways, and how often the most expansive\u2014and expensive\u2014treatments will be used can be affected by who is paying. In October 2002, for example, the FBI seized the records of a San Francisco cardiologist who was accused of doing far more open heart surgeries than were called for by medical criteria, as a means of receiving more income from government payments. One patient who was told by this cardiologist that he needed triple by-pass surgery was told by every other cardiologist he consulted that he needed no such thing. ", " The normal weighing of costs against benefits, which causes more urgent things to be done ahead of less important things when prices ration scarce resources, is less effective when costs are paid by someone other than the actual decision-makers. This can lead to less important things receiving medical attention while urgent things get neglected. When patients pay for their own medical treatments, they are more apt to establish priorities, so that someone with a fractured leg is far more likely to go to doctor than someone with a headache. But, when both are treated free of charge to the patient, then people with minor ailments may take up so much of doctors' time and medical resources that those with more serious medical conditions must be forced to wait.When prices no longer ration, then something else has to ration, since the underlying scarcity does not go away because the government controls prices or provides things free of charge. One of the alternative ways of rationing is by waiting. In 2001, more than 10,000 people in Britain had waited more than 15 months for surgery. This is one of the ways in which the quality of goods and services deteriorate under price controls. Waiting for medical care is particularly costly in human terms, not only because of the needless pain that may be suffered while waiting, but also because the underlying malady may be getting worse when the waiting is not simply a matter of hours spent in a hospital's reception room but months or even years spent on a waiting list before being able to get treatment.People can die from conditions that were initially not very serious, but which grew progressively worse while they were on waiting lists to receive medical care. A celebrated example in Britain involved a woman whose cancer surgery was repeatedly postponed until it had to be cancelled, because the cancer had become inoperable in the course of all the delays. To call this quality deterioration is, if anything, an understatement. ", " The unrecorded human costs of price-controlled medical care are indirectly indicated by those who opt out. These include patients, doctors, and medical facilities. Patients in countries with government-controlled medical prices have left the overcrowded government sector to seek private treatment at their own expense, either at home or in other countries. It is common for Canadians to go to the United States for medical treatment, but rare for Americans to go to Canada for such treatment. Doctors have also opted out in various ways. Some have gone into private practice, despite laws which make it illegal for them to do so if they treat any patients at all who are enrolled in government plans. Some Health Maintenance Organizations in the United States have stopped accepting certain categories of patients for whom the government's reimbursement is inadequate to cover their costs. Sometimes the opting out occurs earlier, when fewer people enter medical school after the rewards of being a doctor are reduced. More than half the doctors in Britain, for example, were not trained in British medical schools but have been imported from many other countries, including Third World countries where the training may not be up to the standards of British medical schools.

A dozen patients with splints and slings sit in a dark corridor awaiting their turn at a 1950s-vintage fluoroscope. \"We wind up seeing the same patients several times over,\" the doctor goes on, \"when one thorough examination could have solved the problem if we had the time.\"though the Soviet Union was an extreme example, similar policies have tended to produce similar results in other countries. Under government-paid health care in Japan, patients also have shorter and more numerous visits than patients in the United States. Under a Korean health care system copied from Japan, a study found that \"even injections of drugs were often split in half to make two visits necessary,\" because \"the doctor can charge for two office visits and two injection fees.\"After Canada's Quebec province created its own government health plan back in the 1970s, telephone consultations went down, office visits went up and the time per visit went down. In other words, medical conditions which neither the doctor nor the patient previously thought serious enough to require an office visit, before price controls, now took up more time by both the patient (in travel time) and the doctor (in the office), thereby reducing the time available to people who had more serious conditions. ", " The costs in Britain's government-run medical system have increased sharply, both absolutely and as a percentage of the country's rising Gross Domestic Product. The National Health Service in Britain absorbed just under four percent of the country's GDP in 1960 and rose over the years until it absorbed well over seven percent of a larger GDP by 2000. Nevertheless, the number of doctors per capita in Britain was just half as many as in Germany, where half the hospital beds were still in private hands, despite a large role for government financing there.In general, where the doctor is paid per patient visit, then a series of treatments that might have taken five visits to the doctor's office can now take ten shorter visits\u2014or more. Therefore political leaders can proclaim that price controls have succeeded because the cost per visit is now lower than it was in a free market, even though the total costs of treating a given illness have not declined and\u2014 typically\u2014have risen. Skyrocketing costs, far beyond anything projected at the outset, have marked government-controlled health care systems in France, Britain, Canada and elsewhere. Responses to such runaway costs have included abbreviated doctors' visit and hospital stays cut short.

Much of the legislation is dedicated to subsidizing animal agriculture, a system under which billions of animals live and die in torturous conditions every year.But this year, there are some animal policy victories in the bill, too \u2014 just small ones.The farm bill is a major vehicle for all agricultural and food policy in the United States. It includes crop insurance, subsidies, nutrition assistance, foreign food aid, research, and conservation. Unsurprisingly, then, it has also become a major vehicle for all federal animal welfare policy.Federal animal welfare policy has traditionally not been pro-animal, especially compared to states and public opinion. Several states have moved ahead in recent years with full bans on some of the worst practices in industrial agriculture, such as battery cages. There\u2019s a surprising degree of public support for even more extensive measures to protect animals.Congress, meanwhile, considered \u2014 and ultimately rejected \u2014 an amendment that would have denied states the authority to enforce animal welfare standards within their own borders. The farm bill could easily have been a major setback for animals and for the voters who\u2019ve overwhelmingly sided with them.Instead, the final version of the bill takes some tentative steps forward for animals. It doesn\u2019t address most of the abuses of the industry, but several of its provisions represent real progress.Here\u2019s what\u2019s in the farm billThere are three major provisions for animal welfare in the act. https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18146068/dog-cat-meat-illegal-farm-bill-animal-cruelty "}, "replies": [" None of them address large-scale factory farming, but they each should modestly reduce animal cruelty in some specific domains. One provision of the farm bill prohibits the import, export, and slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption. Eating dogs and cats is uncommon in the US, but it\u2019s nonetheless legal in 44 states. The bill changes that. The Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act tries to address a problem for both humans and companion animals: Victims of domestic violence are often afraid to leave because they expect their abusive partner to abuse or kill their pets in retaliation. The PAWS Act commits more resources to housing domestic violence survivors with pets and changes law enforcement policy so these situations are a little more addressable in our current legal framework, which imposes only mild penalties for killing someone\u2019s pet. Finally, the farm bill closes a loophole. Animal fighting (such as cockfighting or dogfighting) is illegal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but that leaves it legal in US territories like Puerto Rico and Guam. The bill extends the prohibition on animal fighting to US territories as well.And here\u2019s what isn\u2019t in the farm billAnimal advocates\u2019 greatest fear going into the farm bill debate was that it would include a provision known as the King Amendment, named after Iowa Rep. Steve King. King has been widely criticized, including by his fellow Republicans, for his far-right ties and sympathy for white supremacists. He\u2019s also an ardent opponent of animal rights, and wanted to use the farm bill to prohibit states from setting their own animal welfare standards.The King Amendment was designed to combat a recent trend: voters in states like Massachusetts and California have started prohibiting certain cruel practices, not just on farms in those states but any farms that want to sell their products there. ", " Since California has 50 million people, farmers in much of the country end up abiding by the standards which California voters set, to reach the lucrative market there. King wanted to prohibit California from requiring meat and eggs sold within its borders to meet state-specific standards.The amendment could have interfered with \u201cstate restrictions on gestation crates for pigs, tail-docking of cattle, and horse slaughter, along with state bans on the sale of foie gras, eggs from hens kept in extremely small battery cages, and pets from puppy mills,\u201d concluded the Animal Welfare Institute\u2019s analysis.But Congress rejected the amendment. That means that while the farm bill\u2019s steps for animals may be small ones, they won\u2019t be accompanied by a big blow to animals and voters.What can we expect five years from now?The farm bill is reauthorized every five years, meaning the fight over its contents will be around again before we know it. But it might face a significantly different political and animal-welfare landscape in five years.A string of successful corporate campaigns has gotten many of America\u2019s biggest companies to publicly commit to reforms that improve conditions for animals. Plant-based meat alternatives have taken off, and animal advocates are increasingly looking at meat alternatives as a crucial part of the fight to reduce our reliance on industrial agriculture.Curtailing the cruelties of factory farming polls surprisingly well. Sixty-nine percent of Americans think \u201cfactory farming of animals is one of the most important social issues in the world today,\u201d and 49 percent actually support a ban on factory farms. It may well be that at some point, some politicians at the federal level will notice that animal welfare issues are winning ones \u2014 and that a future farm bill might have larger-scale, more ambitious provisions for animals.

Supporters voiced concerns that passing any of the amendments would have sunk the bill.One amendment would have excluded more prisoners from participating in educational and training programs that allow them to earn credits. Those credits can then be used to gain an earlier release to a halfway house or home confinement to finish out their sentence. Another amendment would have required that victims be notified before a prisoner gets that earlier release. The third would have required the Federal Bureau of Prisons to track and report the re-arrest rate for each prisoner who gets early release.\u201cWhile the bill has marginally improved from earlier versions, I\u2019m disappointed my amendments to exclude child molesters from early release and to protect victims\u2019 rights were not adopted,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cI also remain concerned that reducing sentences for drug traffickers and violent felons is a threat to public safety.\u201dSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said the bill already carves out some 60 different crimes that make prisoners ineligible for early release to a halfway house or home confinement. He said Cotton\u2019s amendment was too expansive and would prevent at least 30,000 prisoners from participation. ", " Durbin said the Federal Bureau of Prisons also gives victims the opportunity to be notified upon a change in the prisoner\u2019s status, but it\u2019s a choice. He said about 10 percent of victims choose not to be notified because of the trauma involved in revisiting the crime. Meanwhile, the amendment from Cotton and Kennedy would make it a requirement.\u201cSupporting the Cotton amendment is basically saying to these crime victims, \u2018We\u2019re going to force this information on you whether it\u2019s in the best interest of your family, whether you want it or not,\u2019\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThat is not respectful of crime victims.\u201dThe bill would affect only federal prisoners, who make up less than 10 percent of the country\u2019s prison population.An array of liberal and conservative advocacy groups rallied in support of the bill. For example, the Koch brothers-backed group, Americans for Prosperity, applauded senators for putting \u201cpolicy ahead of politics.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union said the bill was \u201cby no means perfect.

More than half of the total cost is attributed to personnel compensation and benefits.Since beginning the probe in May 2017, investigating whether Russia was linked to the Trump presidential campaign, Mueller has filed more than 100 criminal charges.Though the investigation comes with a hefty price tag, it has actually paid for its own investigation, with its probe leading to monetary estimated gains of up to $48 million for the government through the tax evasion the investigation has revealed.Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced for conspiracy and obstruction of justice in September. As part of his plea deal, Manafort agreed to forfeit assets that amount to between $42 million and $46 million, including about $22 million in property, CNBC reports. The case revealed how Manafort avoided paying more than $15 million in taxes by laundering $60 million from pro-Russian Ukrainians, CNN reports.Manafort reportedly violated the conditions of his plea deal, and last month prosecutors said that he could face more charges.Earlier this week, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to financial crimes including paying hush money to a porn star and Playboy model. As part of his deal, Cohen agreed to pay $1.4 million in unpaid taxes and hand over $500,000 in assets as well as pay $100,000 in fines.http://fortune.com/2018/12/14/mueller-investigation-cost-tax-cheats/ "}, "replies": [" Please don't post Illya armpits you're making me horny.

He told Pauley he was taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his actions \u2014 but laid much of the blame at the feet of the former boss he once said he'd take a bullet for.\u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired,\" Cohen told the judge, saying his blind loyalty to Trump led him to choose \u201cdarkness over light.\u201dHe noted that Trump had blasted him as being weak on Twitter. \u201cIt was correct but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds,\" Cohen said.He appeared to tear up as he apologized to his family and to the people of the United States.\u201cI am truly sorry and I promise I will be better,\" he said.One of the charges Cohen pleaded guilty to, lying to Congress about his dealings concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's potential collusion with Russia in the 2016 election.

She did not elaborate. A sentencing memo filed by Mueller\u2019s office said Cohen had provided federal investigators with information about his contacts with people connected to Trump and the White House.Cohen lawyer Guy Petrillo argued his client deserved a break for having stood up to the president.\"He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country,\" Petrillo told the judge, according to NBC New York.He argued in court papers that Cohen should be spared jail time, while prosecutors said he should get a little less than the approximately five years called for by federal sentencing guidelines.Pauley sentenced him to a total of 36 months behind bars, and three years of post-release supervision. The judge added a $50,000 fine and said Cohen must turn himself in on March 6.The judge said Cohen deserved some credit for his decision over the summer to admit guilt and cooperate in the Russia probe, but his assistance \"does not wipe the slate clean.\"\"Somewhere along the way Mr. Cohen appears to have lost his moral compass,\" the judge said. \"As a lawyer, Mr. Cohen should have known better.\" ", " Cohen's daughter broke down in tears after the judge handed down his sentence, and was comforted by her glum looking father.Cohen pleaded guilty on Nov. 29 to lying to Congress in an attempt to cover up efforts to build the Moscow tower.After the sentencing, Cohen's former lawyer, Lanny Davis, promised that his client would release everything he knows about the president once Mueller completes his investigation.\u201cThat includes any appropriate congressional committee interested in the search for truth and the difference between facts and lies. Mr. Trumps repeated lies cannot contradict stubborn facts,\u201d Davis said in a statement.Davis later in a phone interview compared Cohen to Richard Nixon's former White House Counsel John Dean, who helped investigators unravel the Watergate cover-up.\u201cIt's just beginning,\u201d he told NBC News.The charges Cohen pleaded guilty to:>Charges brought by the Southern District:\u25cb Count 1-5: Evasion of assessment of income tax liability for pleading guilty to failing to report more than $4 million in income from 2012 through 2016.\u25cb Counts 6: False statements to a bank for Cohen pleading guilty to understating debt from his taxi medallion business in the process of applying for a home equity line of credit with a bank.\u25cb Count 7: Causing an unlawful corporation contribution for when he pleaded guilty to orchestrating a payment made by American Media to Karen McDougal for her \u201climited life story\u201d, an allegation that she had an affair with Donald Trump.\u25cb Count 8: Excessive campaign contribution for when he pleaded guilty to making an excessive political contribution when he paid adult film actress Stephanie Clifford aka Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her story and silence about Clifford\u2019s alleged affair with Donald Trump.

The president and Pelosi tangled over whether the House or the Senate was holding up his proposal. Trump and Schumer jabbed at each other over the import of the midterm elections \u2014 and who will be blamed if a shutdown occurs.\u201cIf we don\u2019t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it\u2019s through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,\u201d Trump ultimately declared. \u201cI will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\u201dThe televised discussion was Trump\u2019s first encounter with the newly empowered Democrats since their midterm victories in the House. It offered a remarkable public preview of how divided government might work \u2014 or break down \u2014 over the next two years as the 2020 presidential election nears.Pelosi later called the confrontation with Trump \u201cwild\u201d and boasted that she and Schumer goaded the president to \u201cfully own that the shutdown was his.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a manhood thing for him,\u201d Pelosi told Democratic lawmakers back at the Capitol. \u201cAs if manhood could ever be associated with him. This wall thing.\u201dPelosi\u2019s comments were described by an aide who was in the room but was not authorized to speak publicly.Schumer, meanwhile, told reporters that \u201cthis Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum that he seems to throw, will not get him his wall and will hurt a lot of people.\u201d "}, "replies": [" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hasn\u2019t given up hope that a shutdown can be averted. The Kentucky Republican said \u201cmagic\u201d sometimes happens in Congress ahead of Christmas, when lawmakers are eager to leave Washington.\u201cI\u2019d like to see a smooth ending here,\u201d McConnell said at the Capitol.Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged Tuesday that the GOP-led House has yet to pass legislation that includes the $5 billion in border wall funds that Trump has been requesting. Ryan likely lacks sufficient votes from Republicans who will lose their majority at the end of the month.Trump is seeking far more for his long-stalled border wall than the $1.6 billion the Senate has agreed to for border security, including physical barriers and technology along the U.S. southern border.The Oval Office meeting between Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the Democrats began civilly, with Trump noting progress for bipartisan criminal justice legislation in the Senate. But the session quickly unraveled as he mentioned his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Said Trump with a smile: \u201cAnd then we have the easy one, the wall. That will be the easiest of all, what do you think Chuck?\u201d Schumer shot back sternly: \u201cIt\u2019s called funding the government.\u201dWhen Pelosi said Trump did not have sufficient support for the wall in the House, Trump interjected: \u201cNancy, I do.\u201dPelosi later said: \u201cThis has spiraled downwards.\u201dAfter Pelosi and Schumer noted Democratic success in the midterm elections, the president asked whether Republicans had won the Senate in the November election.\u201cWhen the president brags he has won North Dakota and Indiana, he\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d retorted Schumer with a smile.Pence, a former House member, sat silently as Trump and the two Democrats bickered. Pence later called the meeting a \u201cgood discussion.\u201d Asked to describe the atmosphere in the private meeting that followed the public quarrel, Pence said, \u201ccandid.\u201d ", " Pelosi and Schumer have urged Trump to support a measure that includes a half-dozen government funding bills largely agreed upon by lawmakers, along with a separate measure that funds the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Sept. 30. The homeland bill includes about $1.3 billion for fencing and other security measures at the border.If Trump rejects that, Democrats are urging a continuing resolution that would fund all the remaining appropriations bills at current levels through Sept. 30.\u201cWe gave the president two options that would keep the government open,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement after the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s his choice to accept one of those options or shut the government down.\u201dPelosi, who is seeking to become House speaker when the new Congress convenes in January, said she and many other Democrats consider the wall \u201cimmoral, ineffective and expensive.\u201d She noted that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, an idea Mexico has repeatedly rejected.If Democrats refuse to support the wall, the military will build the remaining sections, Trump said. \u201cThe wall will get built,\u201d he insisted.Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the incoming House Homeland Security chairman, said using the military to build the wall \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make any sense. I can think of a lot more important things we can do with the military then build a fence.\u201dMcConnell said circumstances were \u201cbeginning to resemble a movie we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d noting that Democrats forced a brief shutdown in January in a dispute over immigration policies.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out very well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that the president\u2019s request is entirely reasonable.\u201dSchumer and other Democrats supported a 2006 law that authorized hundreds of miles of fencing along the southern border, McConnell said, urging Democrats to again back physical barriers \u2014 by whatever name \u2014 along the border. ", " >Behind closed doors, Pelosi disparages Trump\u2019s \u2018manhood\u2019https://www.apnews.com/71881a9859484b1288e5af1e5d97e210WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 At the dawn of divided U.S. government, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to shut down the government over a border wall is really about his \u201cmanhood.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him. This wall thing,\u201d Pelosi privately told House Democrats after a combative, on-camera Oval Office meeting with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The account was described by an aide who was in the room but not authorized to discuss Pelosi\u2019s remarks publicly.Pelosi hardly saved her disdain for Trump for the private audience, letting it rip in slightly more respectful tones a few hours earlier when the president invited journalists into the Oval Office for what were billed as talks over the national budget. What ensued was like a political cage match, with everyone except Pence jumping in with ripostes, setups, lectures and insults. The conflict between Trump and Pelosi dominated the scene, which was replete with gender politics.The spectacle suggested a fierce, two-year struggle in which Democrats control one chamber of Congress for the first time in Trump\u2019s presidency. The new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3, and Pelosi is nominated for her second stint as speaker of the House and second in the line of presidential succession. That carries significant stakes for Trump, who faces oversight investigations into his presidential campaign and administration. Additionally, the House will include a record number of women elected in the #MeToo era \u2014 most of them Democrats \u2014 injecting gender into the discussion like never before. ", " The developments offered a fresh glimpse into Pelosi\u2019s practice of staying \u201cdignified,\u201d as she said Tuesday, certainly in public. It\u2019s advice she\u2019s doled out before. Just before the State of the Union in January, she cautioned Democrats to not get in the way of Trump being what she described as his \u201cslobbering\u201d self.On Tuesday behind closed doors, she repeated the advice in an equally colorful way.\u201cIt goes to show you: You get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you,\u201d she said, according to the aide.So there was public Pelosi on Tuesday, and Pelosi in private.In her opening comments in the Oval Office, Pelosi said failed budget talks would result in a \u201cTrump shutdown\u201d of government.Within moments, Trump alluded to the fact that Pelosi\u2019s election as speaker is not assured.\u201cNancy\u2019s in a situation where it\u2019s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that,\u201d Trump said.Pelosi responded: \u201cMr. President, please don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.\u201dShe kept it clean through a post-Oval Office press conference, suggesting to reporters that she didn\u2019t want to embarrass Trump over his misstatement of facts in front of the cameras.Behind the scenes is another story. Out came her gibe about Trump\u2019s masculinity, not her first. In October at Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics, Pelosi made a similar comment about Trump\u2019s demand for a wall, calling it \u201ca manhood thing.\u201dOn Tuesday, she told Democrats privately, \u201cHe said at the end of the meeting, he said, \u2019We can go two routes with this meeting: with a knife or a candy. I said, \u2018Exactly.\u2019\u201dShe went with the knife.\u201cI told him about Ronald Reagan,\u201d Pelosi told the Democrats. \u201cI said you probably don\u2019t know who I spoke most about on the campaign trail - what president I spoke most about.

", " Trump probably thought he was being clever on Tuesday when he insisted on inviting the press into what was supposed to be a closed-door negotiating session over government spending with House Minority Leader (and likely soon House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).Instead, Trump made a complete fool of himself on camera.He whined and yelled. He interrupted and made dumb, snide remarks. He told the same blatant lies about how the wall is already being built and is already effective that have already been repeatedly fact-checked \u2014 the kinds of Trump lies that are so persistent, the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker had to invent a whole new category of \u201cPinocchios\u201d to describe them.Pelosi and Schumer actually tried, gently at first, to steer Trump away from publicly humiliating himself by urging him to have this discussion off-camera.But when he refused, they also stood firm against his bullying, called out his nonsense, and made him look exactly like the petulant child he is.It\u2019s worth watching the whole exchange, which pool reporters later described as \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cunbelievable even by the standards\u201d of this White House.Trump started getting very testy when Pelosi pointed out that he doesn\u2019t even have the votes in the Republican-dominated House for the full $5 billion of border wall funding that he wants.He insisted that he could \u201ceasily\u201d get the votes in the House if he wanted to, but claimed there was no point because it wouldn\u2019t get through the Senate.Pelosi patiently explained that in the process of legislating \u2014 which, she reminded Trump, \u201cis what we do\u201d \u2014 you start by making your case with bills and votes.\u201cThat\u2019s what the House Republicans would do, if they had the votes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are no votes.\u201d ", " Then Trump kept repeating the phrase \u201cborder security\u201d like it was a magic word, insisted that you can\u2019t have border security without having the wall, and claimed that the wall is already partially built and is already working.But Schumer systematically explained why all of that was nonsense.\u201cThe Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,\u201d Schumer told Trump. He pointed out that according to experts, the wall is \u201cwasteful and doesn\u2019t solve the problem\u201d of border security.And if Trump is bragging about the current state of border security, Schumer asked, then what\u2019s wrong with just giving him the same deal he got last year \u2014 money for border security, but not specifically a wall? (What\u2019s more, as Schumer later pointed out to reporters, most of last year\u2019s $1.6 billion appropriated for border security hasn\u2019t even been spent yet.)Things started getting really bad when Pelosi reminded Trump that voters decisively rejected his agenda in November by putting Democrats back in charge of the House.\u201cWe\u2019ve gained in the Senate!\u201d Trump objected petulantly. He repeated, interrupting Pelosi: \u201cNancy, we\u2019ve gained in the Senate. Excuse me, did we win the Senate?\u201d\u201cWhen the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d Schumer quipped.\u201cI did!\u201d Trump whined. \u201cWe did win!\u201dAnd in a moment almost too self-sabotaging to be believed, Trump actually declared that he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government if he doesn\u2019t get his way on the wall.You really have to watch the video to appreciate how badly Pelosi and Schumer walked over Trump. With the tone being set early on where Pelosi branded any shut down the 'Trump Shut down' and when Trump tried to interrupt, she just put her hand in his face and he just started muttering to himself. ", " >>325485>>325488It is absolutely fucking amazing that he was dumb enough to have this meeting with the press present. So these are the kinds of decisions he makes without Kelly to control him. Holy shit, imagine how much quicker things would have been over without Kelly. I'm not sure whether or not to hate him for dragging it out or appreciate that he delayed the real Republican craziness until they'd lost the House and with it a ton of their power.I liked the \"Trump shutdown\" thing too. You could tell that phrase went into him like a knife with the way he reacted to it. He tried to say \"Pelosi shutdown\" but it was too late, it just sounded like a weak \"No you\" because she did it first, and then he desperately tried to save it by saying he'd be \"proud\" of the shutdown. Pelosi really is a brilliant politician and I honestly see no issue with her being the leader again. She's the best one for the job. ", " >>325515What made things even worse for Republicans is Trump then says he'd be proud to have a shutdown over the Wall. Meaning there is absolutely no way Republicans can blame democrats for a shutdown that happens, even though it would be bullshit to begin with because they don't have control of the House yet. ", " >>325520The body language in this picture is fascinating.https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/oval-1544559185.jpgTrump is mad dog as ever - eager to get down in the dirt and argue with his forward stance + in m-your-face positioning - he's also uncomfortable and anxious too, on the edge of his seat. Chuck is eager to fight too with the same forward stance, but a bit less emotionally involved with limited eye contact - he looks like he doesn't give a fuck anymore. Pence wants nothing to fucking do with it (and in particular, nothing to do with Trump) - leaning back and to the side with his weird, noncommittal grin. And Pelosi looks like she's in charge - good posture, control, relaxed maybe slightly bemused or exasperated expression, no need to lean forward and get in anyone's face to assert her dominant position.A great reflection of how the meeting went too. ", " >>325530I got a different reaction.Pelosi seemed out of her league, the you have the votes talking points she was trying failed as Trump was repeating to her he didn't have the votes.Chuck seemed to do much better, pushing trump into a corner when it came to the shutdown and Trump double downed on it being about immigration, which means chuck and Trump both have something for their donor email. Only thing is the wall proponents, Coulter and the like haven't forgotten the last 2 years. So not passing a bill for the wall and then shutting down the government 2 years later isn't enough. ", " This is his last chance to force it through. He knows very well he could lose 2020 if he doesn't get it built.>What?! He ran on the wall and didn't EVEN BUILD IT?? ", " >>325549It's already too late. If he wanted to do it he needed to do it before the midterms. The Democrats have no reason to comply with his demands because they already know they're going to regain control in less than a month. Especially since he straight up admitted, on camera, that he would take the blame for the shutdown himself, giving them the perfect soundbite to use against him for years.I once heard speculation that George W. Bush famously botched the \"fool me twice, shame on me\" because he was quick enough to realize mid-sentence that he was about to give the media a \"shame on me\" soundbite, so he tried to save it somehow. Trump isn't even smart enough to do that. He straight up gives people the perfect lines to use against him. ", " >>325553The Dems aren't in power yet. ", " >>325558The Republicans were prepared to try and get the $5B for the wall passed in the house (there is debate on whether they could actually do this), and then center their messaging around Democrats in the Senate being responsible for the shut down. Trump blew that plan out of the water today with his comments. While Republicans won't come out and publicly condemn Trump, internally they are seething over this because it limits their options. Trump's base is very strong, but even they can be cracked and a government shutdown when there are other reasonable offers on the table could actually wear it down. Finally in the event of a shutdown the Democrats only have to wait until they are seated in the house, and pass a reasonable bill that has bi-partisan Senate support (much easier when the Republicans will be worn down from the political pressure for shutting down the government) and force McConell to bring it to a vote. Once that passes Trump will literally have to veto it to keep the government shut down, and even then a 2/3rds mojoirty in the Senate forces it back open.Basically, there is no path to victory for Trump's wall now and Republicans know it. ", " >>325561It's almost like Republicans, Trump included, stalled until this could no longer get done... ", " >>325558You don't realize the current situation, do you lad? Trump doesn't have the votes to fund the wall even with a Republican House. Pelosi openly called his bluff on live TV today over it.>>325561>and then center their messaging around Democrats in the Senate being responsible for the shut down.Even that would be an iffy plan because McConell could be a thundering faggot and use reconciliation to bypass the dems in the Senate. Of course that's all moot after Trump said he welcomes a shut down. If the Democrats get someone with balls to run in 2020, I want to see them beat Trump over the head with this, not only that he failed, but he couldn't get Mexico to pay for it and try and bait him into repeating his crowd chant. >Who was supposed to pay for the wall Donald?

Not much of an achievment.

Good fucking luck trying to bark her down. ", " >>325627I doubt trump understands how the gov works or what a speaker is tbh.

Trump doesn't want to get the wall through, he had two years to do it and didn't do shit.He wants to make the democrats embarrass themselves, which is the whole point of trying to push it through not even one month after the election. He's using Pelosi's stonewalling to play to a 2020 campaign by making these interactions as public as possible. ", " >>325678Then why did he throw a tantrum afterwards?

It gave confirmation to a prior observational study in 2013 by the researchers that linked low magnesium levels with low vitamin D levels.The trial also revealed something new\u2014that magnesium had a regulating effect in people with high vitamin D levels. The research provides the first evidence that magnesium may play an important role in optimizing vitamin D levels and preventing conditions related to vitamin D levels.Qi Dai, MD, Ph.D., Ingram Professor of Cancer Research, the study's lead author, described the ideal level as being in the middle range of a U-shape because vitamin D at this level has been linked to the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease in previous observational studies.However, vitamin D was not related to cardiovascular disease in the recent VITAL trial.

Like other tenants interviewed by The Times, he wants that money back.\u201cIf they passed on phony costs to tenants, they should lower our rents,\u201d he said.The Times\u2019s investigation of the Trump family\u2019s finances, based on a vast trove of tax returns and confidential financial records, found that Donald Trump, contrary to his lifelong claim of being a self-made billionaire, received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father.That fortune was greatly increased by dubious schemes \u2014 including instances of outright fraud \u2014 designed to dodge gift and estate taxes, the investigation found. Mr. Trump was a central player in the formulation of those strategies, which included grossly undervaluing his father\u2019s apartment complexes in tax filings, interviews and records showed. He also received tens of millions of dollars in gifts from his father that were disguised as loans or business investments.Mr. Trump and his brother Robert did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But in a written statement for The Times\u2019s original piece, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Charles J. Harder, said that \u201cthere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone,\u201d and that Mr. Trump had delegated tax matters to relatives and tax professionals. ", " The most overt fraud uncovered by The Times involved the sham corporation, All County Building Supply & Maintenance, created by the Trumps in 1992. It appeared, on paper at least, to be a purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings.In reality, the creation of All County did not change how Fred Trump\u2019s business functioned. He and his executives continued to negotiate prices for everything from roofs to window cleaner, but vendors began receiving checks from an All County bank account. Fred Trump\u2019s apartment buildings then reimbursed All County, with an extra 20 to 50 percent tacked on.All County was owned by Donald Trump, his three siblings and a cousin. In some years, the amounts distributed to each Trump sibling ballooned to nearly $1 million, records obtained by The Times show.Because All County performed no real work, the transfer of money through the corporation was essentially a gift that evaded the 55 percent tax in place at the time, tax experts told The Times.Former prosecutors told The Times that the filing of padded invoices with state rent regulators could have led to criminal charges at the time, but that the statute of limitations has long since expired. Civil penalties in cases of fraud remain a possibility, and tax authorities in New York City and New York State have said they are examining issues raised by The Times\u2019s investigation.Lawyers who specialize in representing tenants say the Trumps\u2019 current and former tenants may have an opening to challenge the decades-old increases, potentially rolling back rents and collecting damages.Michael Grinthal, supervising lawyer with the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit legal services and advocacy group, said that the current owners would be held responsible for any damages, but that those owners could have a claim against the president and his siblings. ", " \u201cIf I was talking to those tenants right now, I\u2019d say: \u2018Do it. Go,\u2019\u201d Mr. Grinthal said. \u201cThis case should be fought.\u201dRegulations generally allow tenants to challenge rent for the past four years. But the state\u2019s highest court has held that tenants can look back further to show their landlord increased rent through fraud (though damages are still limited).\u201cIf they are making false statements about how much it costs, that would be pretty much dead center of the definition of fraud,\u201d Mr. Grinthal said.Although the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal oversees rent-regulated apartments, the responsibility for uncovering overcharges falls mostly to tenants, many of whom are unaware of the rules. Just trying to figure out the codes on rental history forms and discern what drove up their rent can seem daunting.Susan Shavitz, 73, moved into her two-bedroom at Trump Village in Coney Island with her mother when Fred Trump completed construction in 1964. Decades later, her rent begin to rise more quickly. She believed at the time that the increases were exclusively because the Trumps had switched the building to a different affordable-housing program.Ms. Shavitz obtained her apartment rental history from the state at the request of The Times, but she could not translate the soup of numbers and abbreviations.https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/14/business/xxtrumptenants3/xxtrumptenants3-jumbo.jpg>A portion of Susan Shavitz\u2019s rental history at Trump Village in Brooklyn. The padded invoices still affect rent, as the initial increase was compounded over the years.\u201cIt made no sense to me whatsoever,\u201d said Ms. Shavitz, a retired teacher. \u201cI have no idea how much of it was because of the improvements.\u201dOther records show the state approved a building-wide rent increase in 1997 of almost $1.1 million after the Trumps installed new windows, terrace doors and boilers, which were an early focus of the All County purchases. ", " That project increased Ms. Shavitz\u2019s rent by $32 a month. While it is not known how much of that is attributable to All County, the cost of improvements bumped up her rent in five of the last eight years that the Trumps owned the buildings, adding 11 percent in all.Ms. Shavitz said that she was financially comfortable and could afford her rent but would still participate in a lawsuit to win back overcharges.Like Ms. Shavitz and her mother, thousands of tenants once saw moving into a Fred Trump building as a step up the economic ladder, an arrival of sorts. In the postwar era, the president\u2019s father came to own more than 10,000 apartments in New York City, and thousands more elsewhere, often financing the construction through low-interest government loans aimed at creating affordable housing for returning veterans and the booming middle class.The rules attached to those loans kept rents low, but Fred Trump excelled at keeping costs low, and the empire became enormously profitable. In just one six-year span, 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, the equivalent today of $210.7 million, according to confidential tax records obtained by The Times.His buildings share a uniform austerity. Most are six-story brick rectangles with incongruously aristocratic sounding names \u2014 Saxony Hall, Westminster Apartments, Green Park Essex. His largest projects were sprawling complexes with acres of lawn in and around Coney Island \u2014 Beach Haven, Shore Haven and Trump Village.The folk singer Woody Guthrie took an apartment at Beach Haven in 1950. He wrote a song called \u201cOld Man Trump,\u201d contemplating the morality of paying rent to someone who would not allow blacks to live in the building. The chorus began: >Beach Haven ain\u2019t my home! >I just can\u2019t pay this rent! >My money\u2019s down the drain! >And my soul is badly bent! ", " Mr. Leitner, 69, remembers that when he signed his first lease at Beach Haven in 1996, the rent was significantly higher than the one quoted during his apartment hunt.He recently obtained the official rental history of his apartment from the state at the request of The Times. It shows that his initial rent was $728, an increase of $154 from the prior tenant\u2019s rate. Most of that jump, in fact, was because of the improvement costs.The effect of those costs was compounded through the years, as every approved rent increase built upon the starting point. And while some portion was certainly legitimate, even a $10-a-month increase because of a padded All County invoice would mean that Mr. Leitner had given his landlords at least $3,800 more than they were legally entitled to over the past 22 years.Housing advocates have long argued that there is widespread abuse of the two programs that owners of rent-regulated apartments use to raise rents based on improvements or repairs. Two Albany lawmakers introduced legislation last August that would end one, known as Major Capital Improvements.\u201cThe M.C.I. program has been subject to abuse by landlords for years \u2014 the fact the Trump family did it just highlights that,\u201d said one of the lawmakers, state Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s time to scrap the program.\u201dBecause the increases carry forward, even tenants who moved in years after the Trumps sold the last of their father\u2019s empire in 2004 were affected by the family\u2019s invoice-padding scheme.\u201cI want it looked at because a lot of tenants may be owed money,\u201d said Angel Castillo, 49, who moved into Beach Haven a few years after the Trump siblings sold it.He moved out just a few weeks ago. The reason: The current landlord increased his rent by $150 a month.\u201cThey told me I was lucky it wasn\u2019t more,\u201d he said.

The implication being that some people simply exist to consume products.

Consumers are basically treated like peasants, and the big wigs of industry are beginning to fashion themselves as our rulers as they control our day to day lives with little to no oversight from incompetent governments whose bureaucracies have become so bloated that they are frozen due to the accumulated lag time of ever increasing regulation. When a bunch of smug shitheads decided to use their inconsequential jobs to smear an entire group of consumers with a broad brush of being 'bigoted, sexist, ect', that group pushed back and reminded everyone that consumers are not mindless animals but actual people and they will only tolerate so much bullshit.

This is why the main stream media picked up and smeared the movement and actively encouraged turning it into a joke. Companies like google probably stepped in and bribed moot because his response to gg was completely uncalled for. Other industries could not risk their own half-awake consumers to wake up and realize they were starting to get more and more fucked over by an ever growing and basically amoral system of production and consumption.

It was an unusual invocation of the War Powers Act, a 1973 law by which Congress sought at the end of the Vietnam War to reassert its constitutional role in deciding when the United States would go to war.>Mr. Sanders called it the first time Congress had used the law to make clear \u201cthat the constitutional responsibility for making war rests with the United States Congress, not the White House.\u201d ", " >\u201cToday, we tell the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventurism,\u201d he said.>Seven Republican senators joined Democrats to pass the resolution: Mr. Lee, Susan Collins of Maine, Steve Daines of Montana, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Todd Young of Indiana.>With both votes, senators diverged sharply from Mr. Trump, who has maintained steadfast support for Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed, even though the C.I.A. has concluded that he ordered the assassination of Mr. Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul in October.>\u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote of whether the crown prince had knowledge of the killing in an extraordinary statement that the president released last month, in which he argued that punishing Saudi Arabia for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death would risk billions of dollars of American arms sales to the kingdom.>Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee and sponsored the measure condemning the crown prince, said on Thursday that it was vital that the Senate \u201cis speaking with one voice\u201d to hold him accountable.>\u201cUnanimously, the United States Senate has said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cThat is a strong statement.

", " \"drain the swamp\" ", " >\u201cThe briefing was a colossal waste of time,\u201d Mr. Cicilline told reporters afterward.>Some senior Republicans offered the administration officials more support.>Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis had explained details of the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, as well as complexities of the relationship with Saudi Arabia.>\u201cThere needs to be action,\u201d Mr. Scalise said, without elaborating. \u201cWe need to hold everyone accountable.\u201d>Mr. Mattis and Mr. Pompeo gave a similar briefing to the Senate late last month. But it broke down as Republican and Democratic senators grew irritated with the administration\u2019s defense of Prince Mohammed. By contrast, after Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, briefed senators last week on the case, they emerged saying they were even more convinced of Prince Mohammed\u2019s role.>The measure limiting war powers in Yemen has been under consideration for months, but senators sharpened its language two weeks ago with a procedural vote that signaled their deep frustration over the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to blame Prince Mohammed for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.>\u201cThe relationship with the crown prince is so toxic, so tainted, so flawed that I can\u2019t ever see myself doing business with Saudi Arabia in the future unless there is change there,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters on Wednesday as debate on the measure began.

That city, on the Red Sea, is a key entry point to Yemen for essential products like food and medicine.>Peace talks are expected to continue in January in an effort to resolve what has become a humanitarian crisis in one of the poorest nations on Earth.

An audio recording of the two-hour meeting was obtained by the Southern California News Group.The apparent scandal came to light last week when the church\u2019s small, K-8 school announced that it had notified police that Sister Mary Margaret Kreuper, and Sister Lana Chang, who both had retired earlier this year, were \u201cinvolved in the personal use of a substantial amount of school funds.\u201d But the nuns had expressed remorse, and the archdiocese and the church were not pursuing criminal charges.Kreuper was the school\u2019s principal, and Chang taught there.The revelation comes four years after a car struck and killed four people as they left a Christmas concert at the church, including a 6-year-old boy.Michael Meyers, the church\u2019s monsignor, told the crowd of a few hundred people that the archdiocese launched an internal investigation six months ago after the organization performed a standard audit of procedures ahead of Kreuper\u2019s retirement after 28 years at the school.Around the same time, Meyers said, a family happened to request a copy of a check made out to the school, and the staff noticed it had been deposited in a bank account other than the school\u2019s.https://www.presstelegram.com/2018/12/05/nuns-improperly-took-as-much-as-500000-from-torrance-catholic-school/ "}, "replies": [" That\u2019s when Kreuper became \u201cvery nervous and very anxious\u201d about the upcoming financial review and requested that the staff alter records, the monsignor said. Meyers said he alerted an archdiocese internal auditor performing the review that \u201csomething was off\u201d and that the auditor confirmed his suspicions.The archdiocese then hired an independent forensic auditor for a deeper review.Without the red flags raised by the check, Kreuper\u2019s \u201cstrange\u201d behavior and a tip made to an archdiocese ethics hotline, officials said the school would never have known about the problem.The improper use of the funds had been going on for at least 10 years, Meyers said. The parish and the school have always run in the black, so it appears no one had suspicions.\u201cThe systems that were set up were dividing people, so nobody knew what was happening,\u201d Meyers said.A retired FBI agent hired by the archdiocese interviewed school staffers and the nuns.\u201cWhen he was talking to Sister Mary Margaret, she did acknowledge that she had been taking all the money, so that\u2019s not a question,\u201d Meyers said.He said no other staff members are suspected of wrongdoing, but a bookkeeper who was unaware of the long-running scheme has voluntarily taken a leave of absence to preserve the integrity of the investigation.Funds raised by the school\u2019s nonprofit education foundation were not affected, officials said.Auditors told parents the \u201clong forgotten\u201d church bank account was opened in 1997 and that bank records before 2012 no longer exist. Only Kreuper and Chang knew about the account, they said.They described a system in which Kreuper handled all checks made out to the school for tuition and fees before handing them over to bookkeeping staff for processing. The principal allegedly withheld some of the checks and deposited them into the other account, endorsing the back with a stamp that read, \u201cSt. James Convent\u201d instead of \u201cSt. James School.\u201d ", " The sisters used a majority of the money for \u201cpersonal gain,\u201d officials said, though some of it was \u201crecycled\u201d back to the school.Meyers said the money would have ended up in the school\u2019s reserve funds.The sisters expressed deep remorse, officials said.The archdiocese is cooperating with Torrance police, but is unwilling to be a \u201ccomplaining party,\u201d archdiocese lawyer Marge Graf told parents. She said the decision was made because the nuns\u2019 order, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, has agreed to pay the school full restitution and impose \u201csevere sanctions\u201d on Kreuper and Chang.When a parent asked what the money was spent on, the attorney said: \u201cWe do know that they had a pattern of going on trips, we do know they had a pattern of going to casinos, and the reality is, they used the account as their personal account.\u201dThe nuns, described by many as best friends, have been removed from ministry, according to a letter from the order read aloud during the meeting. Meyers said they have been moved to separate convents.Church officials did not say whether the order\u2019s restitution agreement hinged on the archdiocese not pursuing criminal charges.Meyers and other officials pledged to make changes to prevent abuse in the future, noting that new principal Noreen Maricich has implemented an online payment system for tuition that draws funds directly from parents\u2019 bank accounts.Reactions in the stunned crowd ranged from disappointment and anger to calls for forgiveness.Many parents were outraged with the decision not to press charges, with some remarking that if the nuns were lay people, they would certainly be in jail. Others called for the restitution to be used to give teachers pay raises and for expenses they said Kreuper claimed the school could not afford, such as awnings for an outdoor eating area. ", " Jack Alexander of Redondo Beach said in an interview with the Southern California News Group that he and other parents are considering banding together to act as a complaining party to Torrance police themselves. But without cooperation from the archdiocese, he is doubtful the effort would lead to prosecution.\u201cWe were an ATM, and people know it and they won\u2019t ask for justice,\u201d Alexander said.The approach sends the wrong message to students, he said, that money is more important than morals.\u201cThey are trying to recapture money, not get justice,\u201d Alexander said.Paul Eakins, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said prosecutors have not been presented with a case yet from Torrance police. Sgt. Ronald Harris said police will confer at some point with the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201cOur office doesn\u2019t decline to charge simply because the victim\u2019s future cooperation is problematical,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cHowever, if a victim is not presently cooperating, we may consider that as a factor in determining whether a case can be successfully prosecuted.\u201dMany in attendance questioned how the school could claim in a parent letter that the embezzlement did not affect the students\u2019 education, and they criticized officials for hesitating at first to reveal the full, six-figure estimate. Some have called on Meyers to resign.Denise Sur, a longtime St. James parishioner who put four children through the school and spoke at the meeting, said in an interview that she was disappointed that details were not provided immediately.\u201cThe archdiocese and our parish leadership has to be held accountable for the poor process as well as what occurred,\u201d she said.Tony Liakos, a parent who also spoke at the meeting, said in an interview that the news is another blow to a church community still reeling from that tragic crash in December 2014. It\u2019s a good school, he said, and he doesn\u2019t want its attributes to be over-shadowed by these two incidents. ", " \u201cThe biggest thing is I\u2019d prefer to see this not hurt the school more than it already has,\u201d he said in an interview.Samantha Pierce, a Torrance resident who has attended St. James for more than 30 years and whose son graduated from the school, said the controversy underscores a failure of church leadership. Only a police investigation can be trusted, she said.\u201cThey convicted the sisters before they actually have the facts on hand, that is the thing that disturbed me the most,\u201d Pierce said.She expressed skepticism that the nuns acted maliciously, even given their apparent admissions of guilt.Kreuper was known to forgive tuition debt and offer assistance to families experiencing financial hardships, Pierce said, and she took trips to Las Vegas because she visited a friend from a Catholic school where she used to teach.A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Las Vegas could not be reached on Wednesday. Kreuper has a past address and P.O. Box in Las Vegas, public records show.If the nuns indeed misused funds wrongfully, Pierce said she would forgive them.Other parents said it was well-known that Kreuper and Chang traveled often and went gambling, but that they claimed they were gifted the trips by a rich relative.\u201cThese nuns took a vow of poverty and said, \u2018Oh no, we\u2019ve got a rich uncle,\u2019 \u201d Alexander said. \u201cThe rich uncle was the parents of the St. James students.\u201d ", " Bump liberals are trying to slide this thread with inane trump threads.

A majority of Soviet locomotives and transport trucks were produced in America (allowing the Soviets to focus on combat production), and a significant fraction of Soviet combat vehicle replacements in 1941 were made in Britain (though through the whole war British vehicles made up only 10-15% of all Soviet combat vehicles) which helped keep the Soviets in the war that first tumultuous year.

Index, illustrations, maps.Reviewed by Theodore O'KeefeAs the sixtieth anniversary of what President Franklin Roosevelt called \"a date which will live in infamy\" (and who would know that better than he?) passes, the controversy over Pearl Harbor is as lively as ever. In no other area of the history of the Second World War have revisionists had quite as much success in convincing a broad section of public that the official version has it wrong: that it is President Franklin Roosevelt, not local commanders General Walter Short and Admiral Husband Kimmel, who should bear the blame for the devastating Japanese attack.Two recent books argue that Admiral Husband Kimmel, in particular, was gravely wronged by his superiors, not merely after December 7, 1941, but in the weeks and months before. One, Robert Stinnett's Day of Deceit, is radically revisionist, claiming to abound in new evidence for a conspiracy involving the president, the war and navy departments, the army chief of staff, and the chief of naval operations, among many other participants. The other, Michael Gannon's Pearl Harbor Betrayed, makes no explicit accusations of conspiracy, nor does it seriously fault America's confrontational diplomacy vis-a-vis Japan in the years leading up to the attack. Odd as it might seem, this reviewer found the second the more satisfying book. ", " >>302753By the way, Roosevelt learnt of the imminent attack through the secret services, as did George W.

Did America think Japan was going to attack? Yes, at some UNKNOWN TIME, PLACE, and METHOD.To the timing, it was a political reality that Japan would have to react to the embargo at some point as they could not sustain their war on China without crucial oil. However, FDR was banking on the Japanese not doing shit until after GERMANY had attacked America in some way. Every war plan had America backing up the UK (and later USSR) first, and dealing with the Japanese problem later. From this perspective American war planners didn't think Japan would ever attack first.To the place, America believed that a Japanese attack would strike south towards the Philippines, and prepared as such by sending most of their equipment down there for the eventual attack. A military strike on Pearl Harbor was considered unlikely due to the distance from Japan and shallow depth of the harbor, which brings us to method.To the method, America thought any attack on Pearl Harbor would have to be sabotage by spies, and thus took precautions to prevent such an attack, grouping up all the ships to make them harder to sabotage but also easier to bomb. Further, carrier-based aircraft were still considered second string to battleships (even by the Japanese), further reducing the perceived threat of air attack.Taking all this together, any warning of imminent attack on Pearl Harbor would have been laughed off as unlikely. Further, letting the Japanese attack would have been strategically insane given the danger to the crucial ships and fuel reserves at Pearl. ", " >>302787You have problems with reading. 1.

A fair amount of his case rests on a sizable number of messages from ships and units of the Japanese navy that Stinnett was able to make public for the first time, not without diligent effort, under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.A central contention of Day of Deceit is that American cryptanalysts solved the main operational code of the Japanese navy (designated as the \"5-Num code,\" for its five number groups, by the code breakers) well in advance of the post-Pearl Harbor solution date accepted by most historians.

What you've done, however, is simplify things without actually looking at context: in your view the Americans had intelligence to suggest an attack could occur, therefore they let the attack happen. However these things do not actually logically flow from one to the other. For instance, Russia knew Germany was going to attack, as politically the USSR and Nazi Germany could never coexist and militarily there was significant buildup along the border. However, this does not mean they let the Germans steamroll them: it merely means they underestimated the German capacity for war. Stalin was reportedly in complete disbelief that Hitler would attack him now, after predicting Hitler would not attack while Hitler was still engaged with the British. Hell, there was a point Stalin had deluded himself that Hitler might actually be his friend, sending significant resources to Hitler to aid him in his battle against the capitalist imperialists. (since you're a stickler for sources, most of this comes from \"Russia's War\" by Richard Overy)The same can be said for America and Japan: America truly underestimated Japan's capabilities and resolve to go to war, believing that either sanctions would work or Japan would wait until Germany declared war. You have to remember that Japan was not considered a serious threat: in the Washington Naval Treaty they got a smaller share of battleships compared to the UK and US (3 for every of the US's 5), Japan had barely participated in the Great War (seizing some German islands, which they were forced to give up postwar), and their only recent fight against a modern power was at Khalkhin Gol in 1939, which they lost (badly).

Hell, the British commanders at Singapore LEFT THE LIGHTS ON because they were that confident the Japs couldn't hit for shit (they could, resulting in the biggest surrender in UK history, which Churchill even considered the greatest failure in British military history). (most of this is from \"War Without Mercy\" by John W. Dower)You also have to remember that Pearl Harbor was an almost unheard of military achievement: Japanese carriers traveled 4,000 miles (undetected) to bomb an enemy fleet at anchor with pure air power. Only the Battle of Tranato, which occurred the month before, was comparable as an all carrier-based aircraft attack on a port, and even then it was at a much smaller in scale. Carriers were otherwise viewed as supporting elements to a conventional surface attack, it took the total loss of the Pacific fleet's battleships for the US to come up with a carrier-centric strategy (which ultimately came to define the postwar era). Again, even Japan, pioneers of carrier strategy, kept trying to force a direct battleship duel at Midway and as late as 1944 in the Battle off Samar. The lack of understanding regarding carrier strategy furthered dismissals of a Japanese air attack at Pearl. ", " >>303030 (4/4 god damn)And as you argued with that other poster, there's no evidence to suggest that the IJN codes were broken before December 7th. Signals intelligence was badly undermanned before the outbreak of hostilities, as was much of the US military due to the Great Depression and general isolationist sentiments. There was also not enough data to fully break the JN-25 code as the IJN was idling with nothing to do before the war and therefore not sending enough messages for interception. Couple that with the belief that SIGINT was for nerds and that Japan was some shitty nonthreat and you can see how JN-25 would remain unbroken until the outbreak of hostilities. (https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/pearl_harbor_revisited.pdf)In conclusion to my overly wordy nonsense, Pearl Harbor was the result of multiple intelligence failures, a fundamental misunderstanding of Japan's capabilities, and an unrealistic diplomatic strategy. These factors are not unique to Pearl Harbor, they repeat throughout history as leaders get complacent of their superiority over their enemies. You can tell how little we learn from history based on how similar the wars of Vietnam and Iraq are. You brought up George W Bush and 9/11, and while I loath to defend the man I must say his administration fell into the exact same traps: those with the proper intelligence failed to coordinate with other intelligence agencies (hence the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, to coordinate all the alphabet agencies), they did not understand the strategy Al Qaeda was capable of, and they were still operating by the older rules of terrorism: planes get hijacked for ransom, not to be smashed into American landmarks.

Actually this would have also been better proof of some Americans' insistence on a big battleship fight: Halsey got tricked into hunting shadows because he wanted the big kills with his surface fighters, which opened up Taffy 3 for attack.Perhaps a better example would have been Operation Ten-Go, where the Japanese flung their remaining battleships at the US in the hopes of doing something before being mercilessly destroyed by Allied air power.

Layton (Author)About the AuthorRear Admiral Edwin T. Layton was, from December 7, 1941 until the surrender of Japan, the staff officer who bore responsibility for keeping the Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet informed about Japan's strategic objectives, capabilities and intended operations.https://www.amazon.com/Was-There-Breaking-Secrets-Harbor/dp/1568523475Layton's argument is detailed and comprehensive, but in general, he maintains that although Washington was reading the highest level Japanese diplomatic code, Purple, little of this was ever made available to the field commanders, other than to MacArthur in the Philippines, who failed to act, not only on the Purple data, but even after he knew that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. The diplomatic information that they were denied not only contained data about the imminence of war, but also included messages sent from Honolulu to Tokyo by Takeo Yoshikawa, the spy sent to observe and report daily on the exact positions of ships in the harbor, using a grid system that was obviously designed for the purpose of targeting torpedoes and bombs.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_T._Layton ", " >>306691>USA lied about it as reasons to enter the warOh lawd he's back.>the Axis power would have wonOh boy we're escalating.

Even without Americans fighting in the war, American supplies would still flow to the Brits and Soviets (why would they ever stop, given that the American public advocated for intervention against the Axis, as long as that action fell short of war), and those supplies would have been enough to beat the Germans (but not as cleanly). Meanwhile Japan would have sat on it's ass, because in this timeline they never attack America, which in turn means they've resigned to their fate to never expand further to contest the oil and rubber. They then end up running out of oil and get stuck in an eternal Chinese quagmire until the Soviets decide it's time for Khalkhin Gol 2: electric boogaloo.

The net result was that we detected absolutely no warning of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor. A broken - hearted Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet on that 7 December, 1941, certainly had scant reason to thank our basement group for anything.

Bye and peace to all ", " >>306701Okay I'm going to just tear your argument apart at it's logical core. Your premise is that FDR had to knew about the Pearl Harbor attack and deliberately did nothing to stop it in order to maximize damage to make sure the American public would support going to war. If we believe this premise, then we must also believe the following: if the attack was successfully fended off, there would not be enough damage for the American people to support war with Japan.There are several problems with this logic, the most glaringly obvious being that JAPAN DECLARED WAR ON AMERICA. ANY attack by Japan on America, regardless of damage inflicted, would have included a declaration of war, and as such the American public would have zero choice but to accept war. If Japan, for some reason, decided to make an undeclared military strike, it would have also caused America to join into the war (remember that the historical war declaration failed to arrive before the attack, which was a huge part of why Americans were so pissed) because no nation on earth just goes \"they didn't declare war so it's no big deal lol.\"Declarations of war aside, we move to the next problem in your logic: that minimal damage would not rally America to war. No nation, upon being attacked, would ever surrender (and this would be a surrender, as America would be giving up half it's pacific holdings without a fight) because \"damage was minimal.\" That is absolute insanity. A defending nation that only sustains minimal damage during the initial attack has even MORE incentive to beat the living daylights out of the attacker, because they have a massive upper hand. To immediately surrender squanders any ability for the defending nation to secure favorable concessions and reparations they could have gained by fighting. The Japanese KNEW this, their entire strategy banked on dealing massive damage right off the bat for force an American surrender.

Too bad the Soviets already knew and were well on their way to developing their own. Further, the US had no idea about the dangers of radiation at the time, and you can tell this because Operation Downfall included dropping nuclear bombs in close vicinity of US troops, irradiating literally millions of American citizens.>Why do it to the Japanese and not on Germans? Because Germany surrendered. The Allies had literally no qualms laying waste to entire German cities (see every Axis supporter crying about Dresden), so an atom bomb would not have been a drastic escalation. I do not deny that there was significant racism, but let's not pretend the US was more keen on bombing Japan over Germany (\"Germany first\").>You don't see a demand for a memorial for the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a reason.

Imperial Japan already tried the whole \"Asian unity against the whites\" shtick with the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but that shit fell apart once the other Asian nations realized that an Asian master was no better than a white master (and once they overthrew the Japs, they overthrew the whites shortly after, see Vietnam).

From Layton's own words (and the many five star reviews of the book), his goal in writing his book was to absolve Admiral Kimmel of what he viewed was an unjust blame and reveal he was a scapegoat of upper command's FAILURE to recognize the nature of the Pearl Harbor attack. Notice the \"FAILURE,\" Leyton is not intoning deliberate malice, but incompetence of the highest levels. As I have pointed out many times this level of incompetence is not unheard of in history, let alone the same war (Soviets being surprised by Operation Barbarossa), and therefore not in itself proof of a conspiracy. In addition, shifting blame happens literally every day in politics and military, and therefore scapegoating Kimmel is also not proof of conspiracy, just that the brass was trying to deflect criticism from their failures.Your entire argument is that FDR was malicious in his failure to protect Pearl, and you have failed to provide evidence of that malice time and again.

Hoover says that FDR was itching for war, not that FDR knew about and let Pearl get attacked to \"maximize damage.\"Plus \"trying to get a peace agreement\" does not mean they were going to get one, even with different American leadership. Nazi Germany sought peace with Britain, but Britain refused because the terms were unreasonable (and Hitler had broken his promises again and again), so without knowing the terms of the proposed Japanese peace agreement we have no idea if FDR was sitting on what he wanted or if the Japanese were just using the peace talks as cover/making unreasonable demands.

Now you are desperately trying to clear Stinnet by making wild accusations against his critics and twist the words of other historical accounts to serve your purpose.You have been making bolder and wilder claims to cover up your initial failure while fluffing it all up with an indignant tone and plenty of fallacies and insults.

It can be associated with learning difficulties and mood problems.Until now, it was estimated that between 2% and 5% of children in the UK had the disorder as a result of their mother\u2019s alcohol intake while she was pregnant. The NHS says alcohol crosses the placenta to the growing baby, who cannot process it well, resulting in damage to cells in the brain and body.But the UK has one of the highest reported rates of drinking in pregnancy, at just over 40%, only exceeded by Ireland, Belarus and Denmark, leading some to question the prevalence figure.They developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with FASD.They found that 79% of mothers had drunk any alcohol at all when they were pregnant. Between 6% and 17% of the children in the study had symptoms, depending on the exact way in which the researchers did the screening.Dr Cheryl McQuire, researcher in epidemiology and alcohol-related outcomes at the University of Bristol, who led the research, said this sort of screening \u201cis not the same as a formal diagnosis.\u201cNevertheless, the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and FASD-relevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that FASD is likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK.\u201dhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/30/study-suggests-rate-of-foetal-alcohol-syndrome-disorder-higher-than-thought "}, "replies": [" It was important to have better figures, so that children affected could get the help they needed, she said.However, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) disputed the figures and warned that women who are pregnant could panic and consider abortion if the results were miscommunicated.\u201cWe advise real caution over the interpretation and communication of these findings,\u201d said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the charity, which sees over 70,000 women each year for pregnancy counselling and abortion care.\u201cThis study, as the authors themselves acknowledge, does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded, and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety.\u201cMany women have drunk before finding out they are pregnant, and messaging around pregnancy drinking which overstates risk or distorts the available evidence can lead some women to consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy, or spend that pregnancy wracked with guilt and anxiety. This does not benefit anyone.\u201dCampaigners welcomed the findings, however. \u201cThese figures should raise alarm bells throughout Westminster and wake up everyone in the NHS and the Department of Health, who for decades have been keeping their heads in the sand about this largely avoidable public health crisis,\u201d said Sandra Butcher, chief executive of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK.

But they said the government needs a strategy for diagnosing children and supporting the families.Dr Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said many cases remained undiagnosed and that screening studies of children are needed. \u201cFASD remains the most common and potentially preventable cause of learning and behavioural difficulties in the world,\u201d he said.\u201cWhile we incorporated expert clinical judgment in our algorithm specification and validation process, it was not feasible to conduct individualised assessments of FASD.\u201dThe new study, published in the journal Preventive Medicine, was carried out by researchers at Bristol and Cardiff Universities, looking into the records of nearly 13,500 children born in the 1990s whose families had signed up to a major, ongoing study.They developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with FASD.

But high rejection rates and life-threatening complications from immunosuppression have limited the success of human intestinal transplantation.When a person receives a transplanted organ, the immune system often recognizes the new organ as foreign and destroys it. Powerful immunosuppressive drugs blunt these responses, but that makes the patient much more susceptible to infections and other complications.How Do Blood Cells From the Donor Help the Transplant Recipient?Analysis of circulating white blood cells in patients after intestinal transplantation suggests that the cells derived from the donated intestine have matured and been educated in the recipient to be tolerant of the recipient's own tissues. Likewise, white blood cells made by the recipient after the transplant may be educated to be tolerant of the donated tissue.\"We are clearly showing that there's immunological cross-talk between the two sets of blood cells that protects the transplant from the patient's immune system and protects the patient from the transplant,\" says Sykes.The hematopoietic stem cells in the intestine are eventually replaced by a circulating pool from the recipient, the researchers also found.How the Finding Could Improve Transplantationhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-11-blood-cells-sourceyour-gut.html "}, "replies": [" Because patients with more donor blood cells had lower organ rejection rates, the results point toward new strategies for managing organ transplantation.The intestine's reservoir of blood-forming stem cells was discovered when researchers\u2014led by Megan Sykes, MD, director of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology\u2014noticed that the blood of patients who had received intestinal transplants contained cells from the donor. The researchers tracked the donor's blood cells back to their source: hematopoietic stem cells in the donated intestine.The blood cells created from cells in the donor's intestine also may be beneficial to the transplant recipient. The more donor blood cells a patient had in circulation, the less likely they were to reject their transplants.\"It's possible that patients with a high level of donor cells may not require as much immunosuppression as they are currently getting,\" says Sykes, \"and reducing immunosuppression could improve outcomes.\"Seeding transplanted organs with additional hematopoietic stem cells from the donor may also increase donor-recipient cross-talk and boost tolerance of the transplant.\"That could improve the lives of transplant patients dramatically,\" Sykes says. \"Our ultimate goal is to get immune tolerance, which would allow us to remove immunosuppression altogether and have the graft treated as self by the patient. That's really the Holy Grail.\" ", " What's NextThe researchers are planning a study that will try to boost the number of hematopoietic stem cells delivered during intestinal transplantation, hopefully leading to higher levels of donor blood cells in circulation, immune tolerance, and a reduced need for immunosuppressive drugs.Other types of transplants may benefit from similar interventions, even for organs that don't appear to carry their own reservoirs of hematopoietic stem cells.CaveatsThis study analyzed 21 patients who had received intestinal transplants.Although the finding of a novel population of hematopoietic stem cells is exciting, it does not yet justify changes in the current standard of care.The study, \"Human Intestinal Allografts Contain Functional Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells that are Maintained by a Circulating Pool,\" was published Nov. 29 in Cell Stem Cell.

It is easy to see that since there are so manywhite people in America that there will be a large amount of white on white crime. There are around *6 times as many white people* as blacks. There actually *should be* a percentage of white on black crime. Yet whites only contribute a paltry 11% of crime to the blacks much smallerpotential victim set. On the other hand, blacks contribute a full 15 percent into the much larger (6X) set of white crime victims. The evidence is clear here.

Camille Phillips at NPR reports the change is one of several to the curriculum that will be implemented in the 2019-2020 school year.Standards previously adopted in 2010 were designed to play up the role of states\u2019 rights and sectionalism and downplay slavery as the reason Texas entered the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. Slavery, one board member said at the time, according to The Washington Post, was a \u201cside issue.\u201dWhile the board\u2019s Democrats, who first proposed the change in language in September, wanted to update standards to elucidate the central role that slavery played in the Civil War, the Republican-dominated board succeeded in keeping states\u2019 rights issues and sectionalism on as \u201ccontributing factors\u201d for the Civil War. The resulting compromise, according to the board, will teach \"the central role of the expansion of slavery in causing sectionalism, disagreements over states' rights, and the Civil War.\"Ron Francis, a high school history teacher in Highland Park, calls the compromise wanting. \u201cThe lies they\u2019re telling are a little smaller than the lies they used to tell,\u201d as he puts it to Kathyrn Lundstrom at The Texas Tribune.During the meeting, Democratic board member Marisa Perez-Diaz explained the root of the frustration, saying, \"What the use of 'states' rights' is doing is essentially blanketing, or skirting, the real foundational issue, which is slavery.\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/texas-will-finally-teach-slavery-was-main-cause-civil-war-180970851/ "}, "replies": [" Republican board member David Bradley was one of the leading voices behind keeping states\u2019 rights in the curriculum. \"Each state had differences and made individual decisions as to whether or not to join into the conflict, correct? I mean, that's the definition of states' rights,\" he said in the meeting.Since 1917, when state law authorized the board, which is often staffed by non-educators, to purchase all public school textbooks, it has maintained control of Texas' public school curriculum. Lundstrom of the Tribune reports the board\u2019s standards have turned into a battleground for conservatives and liberals over what students should be taught.Teachers will sometimes skirt these standards\u2014for instance, one tells Lundstrom that she teaches the Reconstruction era, the period after the Civil War that set the stage for racial politics in the United States for the next century and a half, even though it is not mandated. However, the voluntary nature of such practice guarantees that not every student will be taught it. Meanwhile, the numerous topics that are included on standardized tests are not taught with the depth or nuance that they demand because teachers are forced to go through them in rapid fashion so as to cover all of the material needed to prepare their students to perform well on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, or STAAR test.In response to such criticism, the board is working to streamline the state's curriculum standards to give teachers a little more space to teach. However, some of what they\u2019re editing out has also been criticized. For instance, as Lauren McGaughy at The Dallas Morning News reports, the new curriculum still lists only one cause for the extremely fraught Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and it cuts out many historical figures, including Francis Scott Key, who wrote the Star-Spangled Banner, African-American poet Phillis Wheatley, as well as several Confederate leaders. ", " Under pressure, the board voted to keep Helen Keller and Hillary Clinton on a list of notable Americans that could be included in lessons, though Oprah Winfrey, Barry Goldwater and astronaut Ellen Ochoa got the nix. The board also voted to keep in a specific description of the defenders of the Alamo as \"heroic.\"While some of the issues here are distinctly inter-Texan battles, over at The Houston Chronicle Joanna Perrillo explains that the curriculum decided by the school board also has national implications. After all, Texas represents one-tenth of grade school and high school students in the U.S., and the textbooks written to Texas standards go to other states as well.

One Democrat vows: 'The days of denial and inaction ... are over.'Federal scientists warned in a new report Friday that changes in the climate will disrupt the economies of every region in the country in the coming years, with costs threatening to reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually by the middle of this century.The message, echoing decades of sobering conclusions from the world's leading climate scientists, is at odds with President Donald Trump's repeated scoffing at the idea of global warming. And the administration chose to release it on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day and one of the slowest news days of the year.But despite the timing, the report is bound to energize the new class of progressive Democrats set to take control of the House in January. Many of them, led by incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, are already pushing for an expansive \"Green New Deal\" as one of the rallying cries the party would take into the 2020 campaign.Democrats wasted no time in pouncing on the report.\"Rather than hiding the facts, President Trump should heed the message of our nation\u2019s preeminent climate scientists and experts,\" said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, who is in line to chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He added: \"The days of denial and inaction in the House are over as House Democrats plan to aggressively address climate change and hold the Administration accountable for its backward policies that only make it worse.\u201dRep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who is set to take the gavel at the House Science Committee, said it's time to start addressing the causes of the wildfires, devastating storms, coastal flooding and toxic algae blooms that plagued much of the U.S. this year. "}, "replies": [" \"That is why I have made climate change one of my top priorities for the Committee going in to the next Congress,\u201d she said in a statement.The report, which runs more than 1,600 pages, is the latest scientific work to warn that the planet is due to undergo devastating changes in the coming years that will permanently alter the coastlines, worsen droughts and storms and foster the outbreaks of dangerous diseases as temperatures climb. And while the report said quick action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution could dramatically affect the state of the planet by the end of the century, many of the impacts the U.S. will see in the next two decades appear irreversible.\"Because several [greehouse gases], in particular carbon dioxide, reside in the atmosphere for decades or longer, many climate-influenced effects are projected to continue changing through 2050, even if GHG emissions were to stop immediately,\" said the Fourth National Climate Assessment Vol. II.\"While mitigation and adaptation efforts have expanded substantially in the last four years, they do not yet approach the scale considered necessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, environment, and human health over the coming decades,\" the report said.The government officials who oversaw the report said there had been no political influence over its findings, but they sidestepped questions about whether the White House sought to bury the report by releasing it in the middle of a long holiday weekend.\"We hope you will focus on the content of the report,\" David Reidmiller, the director of the National Climate Assessment, told reporters. \"We think the report speaks for itself.\"Progressives are pushing House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to bring back a special committee on climate change and empower it to craft new legislation. Some senior Democrats have opposed that move as an erosion of existing committees\u2019 powers. ", " Ocasio-Cortez pressed that case in a tweet, taking her Democratic colleagues to task.\"People are going to die if we don\u2019t start addressing climate change ASAP. It\u2019s not enough to think it\u2019s 'important.' We must make it urgent,\" she wrote. \"That\u2019s why we need a Select Committee on a Green New Deal, & why fossil fuel-funded officials shouldn\u2019t be writing climate change policy.Even before its release, Trump was attacking climate change science this week as cold temperatures bore down on the East Coast, tweeting on Wednesday, \u201cWhatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d (Weather and climate are different things, scientists frequently point out.)The White House tried to downplay the new report's conclusions Friday, claiming that they are \"largely based on most extreme scenarios.\" The White House also noted that U.S. greenhouse gas pollution has declined 14 percent since 2005 \u2014 although the causes of that drop include trends that Trump opposes, such as a shift away from coal-fired power plants.The new report, which Congress requires to be issued every four years, was released by U.S. Global Change Research Program. It is the product of 300 scientific experts under the guidance of a 60-member federal advisory committee, and it was open to review by the public, 13 federal agencies and a panel at the National Academy of Sciences.Scientists who worked on the report, such as Andrew Light, a fellow at the World Resources Institute and professor at George Mason University, said it was the most comprehensive look at what various regions and economic sectors could expect to see.\"There is essentially no sector of the economy that will not suffer if we don\u2019t get a handle on [climate change],\" told a conference call with reporters.The report also makes it clear that the changing climate will cause the most suffering to poor areas, minority communities and indigenous people, said Brenda Ekwurzel, the senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ", " \u201cWhile the report doesn\u2019t offer policy recommendations, the findings certainly make a convincing case that the White House should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger scale response is required to keep people safe,\u201d she said.It\u2019s the first climate report that is wholly a product of the Trump administration. A previous volume, the Climate Science Special Report published a year ago, was started under the Obama administration but published under Trump.Last year\u2019s report said the 1.8 degree Fahrenheit increase in global temperatures since 1901 had lifted temperatures to their highest level in the history of modern civilization, and that it was extremely likely human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, were the dominant cause of the warming since the mid-20th century.The new federal report lays out grim scenarios for each part of the country, including how changes in the amounts and timing of snow and rainfall is leading water stress.For example, hydropower production in the Southwest and the Northwest will be under threat, even as groundwater depletion is worsening drought risk in many parts of the United States, particularly in the Southwest and Southern Great Plains. Dependable and safe water supplies for U.S. Caribbean Hawaii, and Pacific Island communities are threatened by drought, flooding, and saltwater contamination due to sea level rise.The frequency and severity of allergic illnesses, including asthma and hay fever, are expected to increase as a result of a changing climate, it said, and warming temperatures are projected to alter the geographic range of disease-carrying insects and pests, exposing more people to ticks that carry Lyme disease and mosquitoes that transmit viruses such as Zika, West Nile and dengue.\"Communities in the Southeast, for example, are particularly vulnerable to the combined health impacts from vector-borne disease, heat, and flooding,\" the report said. ", " Agriculture will be particularly affected, it said, with new challenges to livestock health, declines in crop yields and quality, and extreme weather will threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security and price stability.\"Increases in temperatures during the growing season in the Midwest are projected to be the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of U.S. agriculture,\" the report said.The Northeast will suffer from flooding from heavy rainfall, storm surge and rising high tides, which will compound issues with aging infrastructure in the Northeast.Fossil fuel producers are likely to feel the changes too, it predicted, with Increased drought risk expected to hurt oil and gas drilling and refining, as well as electricity generation from power plants that rely on surface water for cooling.\"Even if significant emissions reductions occur, many of the effects from sea level rise over this century \u2014 and particularly through mid-century \u2014are already locked in due to historical emissions, and many communities are already dealing with the consequences,\" it said. Still, the report offered some modest hope that communities could stem some of the harm by acting now to adapt to changes, such as by protecting shorelines and conserving coastal ecosystems to guard against increased coastal flooding. \"More than half of the damages to coastal property are estimated to be avoidable through well-timed adaptation measures,\" the report said.But even if Democrats put climate change at the top of their agenda, it will be difficult for them to overcome the Trump administration's aggressive rollbacks of the Obama administration\u2019s climate policies, from its weakening of controls on power plants\u2019 and vehicles' greenhouse gas pollution to its withdrawal from the nearly 200-nation Paris climate change agreement. ", " Even the Paris agreement's voluntary pledges are too modest to prevent many of the catastrophes that are on the way, according to a report issued in October by the U.N.\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change. That report said countries would need \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented\u201d actions to prevent massive changes, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reducing net emissions to zero by mid-century. No plans for such severe cuts are even remotely in the works.Kristiana Huber, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said the report\u2019s focus on regional impacts will help give communities a sense of what they are likely to face in terms of rising temperatures or intensifying disasters.\u201cWe hear from cities we work with ... that uncertainty about climate data is a real barrier to decision-making,\u201d she said.In an email Friday, the White House said the report took a particularly pessimistic point of view.\u201cThe report is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in the email.The next report \u2014 due out in four years \u2014 would look more closely at climate modeling and projections, the spokesperson said, which would \u201cprovide for a more transparent and data-driven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes.\u201d ", " This means Democrats can accuses Trump of being a threat to national security on an entirely different front outside of all the way's he's already jeopardized the country.

", " >>316633Sure greed happens. But in capitalism it's more rampant and even favourable. The more money you collect the better. That is greed basically. Greed and money (capital) are intertwined. It's not good for other people like workers if you give yourself a reward for doing a shittastic job so it's not good for societies on the whole. But capitalists seem to think it is. Every system has loopholes. But in capitalistic society you can easily buy, sorry lobby, those loopholes for you. Lobbying costs money. Also when politician gets money for his election campaign, it's job well done for him. He gets money, and gets elected. But I don't think it's good for society. In society where money is not the most important thing, things are more balanced, for example lobbying is more difficult.You are talking about communism and planned economies. Well, I wasn't. Every ism is shit because they only work on paper. They always lead to problems in the long run. In capitalism the problem is rich people get richer, and people who are rich have more power on everything because everything is dependent on money. Also every ism don't take account the problems with it in the real world. There are no problems in paper.

Whether that was meant as support of communism or not really doesn't matter, as that is how it will be commonly interpreted. My whole point was that no system is perfect because people are not perfect. So long as greed exists, there will be people exploiting one another. We can go into the nuance of how easy it is to exploit one system or another as well as the pros/cons, but that isn't what this discussion was about ", " >>316651Sure. And my point is that in capitalism the greed and capitalism itself leads into unfair situations like in the OP. Which pretty much was the point Marx made. So he was right. ", " >>316662Greed leads to unfair situations in every context. The method by which the greed manifests itself is the only difference. This should be blatantly obvious. And if you really want to get into the nitty gritty details, the US economy is not capitalist but rather a mixed market which is closest to cronyism/corporatism. ", " >>316664Not him but I'd say that corporatism and cronyism are the natural results of capitalism ", " >>316665But they aren't Capitalism. In any case, as I stated before, while we could go into the details on this it isn't what the discussion was initially about and I don't want to derail this thread further. ", " >>316666Capitalism leads to cronyism. Which is, in larger scale, the point Marx made that capitalism itself leads into trouble. The problems in capitalism are written in the system itself. It logically follows that if money is always the driving force and number one thing in capitalism, the problems also come from money itself, so basically capitalism itself. The greed problem is BIGGER in capitalism than in any other system because greed is even favourable and more money=better. People who have more money have more power in capitalism. Then even democracy is shittier in capitalism. One vote is not one vote any more but after election people with money for example can lobby favourable things for them, shittier things for other people. Because they have money to do that. Some other system has some other problems which are bigger than in capitalism. But the scale of the problems is the most important thing.

The main difference with neanderthals was probably that they were not AS social as humans. They formed family groups, as mates do, and they probably had some oral communication (language?), but as far as we know never developed larger multi-family villages. They cared for their elderly or weak, to a point, but they would probably still come off as harsh to us in that regard. They were probably not as cognitively advanced as humans, as their stone tool production has virtually no changes for a hundred thousand years right until they disappear. Although to be fair, archaic humans stayed at the same level for a very long time too, only until 70-50,000 years ago. Also, while neanderthals were stronger than humans, and more cold adapted, they weren't good throwers for example. Most of their hunting seems to have been up close and personal spear hunting.

They probably gave each other a wide berth, but when hunting/shelter/water use claims overlapped, they probably did skirmish. Though neanderthals could lob rocks, and probably pretty heavy shit too, they couldn't throw over-arm. Humans had projectiles which neanderthal did not.

The supposed purpose of his trip was to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I.But in a move the grandson of Winston Churchill called \u201cpathetic,\u201d Trump abandoned plans to attend a major ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, located near the location of the Battle of Belleau Wood, because of light rain.Trump, refusing to take any responsibility for his own disrespectful actions, blamed the Secret Service.\u201cOther leaders in Paris for the anniversary managed to visit cemeteries despite the weather,\u201d the New York Times wryly noted.When he came back, Trump retreated into a \u201ccocoon of bitterness and resentment,\u201d according to the L.A. Times. On Veterans Day, the Times noted, Trump refused to even travel two short miles to Arlington Cemetery to lay a wreath upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, \u201cas presidents since at least John F. Kennedy have done to mark the solemn holiday.\u201dThe French Embassy participated in the ceremonies at Arlington, but not America\u2019s commander in chief.Trump didn\u2019t just abandon veterans; he also used active duty troops as political props.Before the midterms, Trump tried to rile up his base with racist fear-mongering about a group of refugees traveling on foot who were still thousands of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. ", " Trump tried so hard to convince people that women and children seeking asylum were a national security threat, he actually sent thousands of U.S. troops to the southwest border to anticipate their arrival.But after the midterms, Trump has been all but silent about the supposed threat.\u201cI\u2019ve never before seen an American president, after going all over the country about this national crisis, then the day after an election shrug,\u201d Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, told the New York Times. \u201cIt was a dangerous form of xenophobia, aimed solely for electoral purposes and had nothing to do in the end with real national security.\u201dSome of those troops are spending their time shoveling horse manure. The \u201cmission\u201d is scheduled to go through mid-December, meaning these troops will be separated from their families on Thanksgiving, all because of Trump\u2019s political stunt.Trump also sent a clear message that he does not care about whether our troops serving overseas get to participate in the democratic process.As Florida is methodically counting ballots in close races, Trump called for the state to disenfranchise thousands of ballots from military families stationed overseas.Trump said Florida election officials \u201cmust go with Election Night\u201d to decide the outcome of the races.However, Florida law allows for votes cast overseas, including military ballots postmarked by November 6, to be counted through November 16. If Trump had his way, he would throw out military votes.Trump\u2019s disdain for troops is clearly part of a pattern.However, Florida law allows for votes cast overseas, including military ballots postmarked by November 6, to be counted through November 16.

In many cases, saddled with weak candidates and lackluster fundraising, they failed to even compete with Democrats this year.In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin won re-election with ease, as did Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Sen. Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, and Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania.Michigan elected a new Democratic governor, picked up seats in the state\u2019s House and Senate, and claimed victory in the Secretary of State race, an office the party hasn\u2019t held in three decades.The biggest news out of Wisconsin was the defeat of the notoriously anti-worker Gov. Scott Walker, who once had presidential aspirations and has served as a Trump loyalist.Meanwhile, Pennsylvania was an electoral disaster for the GOP.Thanks in part to a court-ordered redistricting of the state\u2019s blatantly gerrymandered congressional districts, Democrats dominated on Election Day.Not only did Casey win his U.S. Senate contest by a huge margin, but Democrats also retained the governor\u2019s mansion and flipped four House seats in the Keystone State.

And come January, the majority of state attorneys general will be Democrats, which could prove crucial in future battles over everything from healthcare to voting rights.On top of that, Democrats racked up victories in key gubernatorial races across the country, including many in the same states that propelled Trump to victory just two years ago. In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker, handing Democrats a crucial win in a state that proved critical to Trump\u2019s electoral college victory in 2016.

It's hard to say what can be done that wouldn't grossly infringe on the 2nd amendment, this lack of easy solution is why politicians stick to prefab talking points rather than trying to compromise on a solution (it's easier to claim you have the silver bullet and the other side is preventing you from using it).The only things that I can think of is telling people to secure their guns at home, as I know a few of these shootings were done by kids who stole their parents' guns (plus it prevents various accidental gun deaths).

A great story is a nurse who was treated victims of two shootings, one where the shooter used a pistol, the other where the shooter used an AR-15.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-i-saw-treating-the-victims-from-parkland-should-change-the-debate-on-guns/553937/Mag size restriction is basically a stop gap because democrats know they can't outright ban certain types of guns at this point, so all they can do is minimize the amount of damage a shooter can do. Also, we've had an uptick in mass shooting deaths after Republicans allowed the Brady bill to expire, so there is a correlation.

The 9mm rounds just traveled through the victims of the pistol shooting and they all recovered. The 5.56mm rounds from the AR-15 destroyed the insides of the victims to the point they couldn't be saved. To spell it out for you, if the shooter at Parkland used a pistol and hit the victims in the exact same spot as he did with his AR-15, a lot more of them would have survived. But please, be unreasonable and just wait for Democrats to gain enough of a majority where the liberal wing takes change where they do pass a bill that's your worse nightmare where they grab your guns.And that Republican Supreme Court? They'll have packed it or decide to ignore them because Judicial Review is for suckers (According to our new AG) ", " >>312641Note by the way that this is an intentional design effect of the 5.56mm round. It's called hydrostatic shock.When a bullet enters the body it slows down - energy is transmitted from the bullet to the target. A similar effect is observed in water. Low-velocity pistol rounds pass right through most targets, creating a wound channel. High-velocity rounds (5.56 and up, usually, though it is also noticeable in low-velocity hollowpoint rounds) transmit enough energy quickly enough that a shockwave is observed in the fluid of the target's body.This shockwave destroys tissue, liquefying organs and muscles. The damage is significant enough that if a major organ is hit in this way the target is effectively doomed - a liver can survive a puncture, but not the majority of its tissue being pulverized.Again, this is a design feature of high velocity ammunition. The military designed the 5.56 to maximize this effect while also minimizing recoil, allowing for controllable fire that would inflict maximum casualties on the enemy.The exact same principles allow mass shooters to inflict maximum damage on their victims.

Bill Nelson. On Thursday, a Nelson spokesperson tersely dismissed Scott's effort: \u201cThe goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately.

Fox News confirmed Friday that an unknown number of \u201cbags\u201d of uncounted early vote ballots have been found in Broward County. It is less than 100 ballots total, but officials did not give a precise number.Scott's emergency complaint accused Snipes, the Broward County supervisor of elections, of being \"unwilling to disclose records revealing how many electors voted, how many ballots have been canvassed, and how many ballots remain to be canvassed,\" and charges that the uncertainty \"raises substantial concerns about the validity of the election process.\"President Trump himself has gone after Snipes, telling reporters Friday, \u201cShe has had a horrible history \u2026 and all of a sudden they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.\u201dAnd one conservative congressman in Florida has taken matters a step further, calling for Snipes\u2019 removal.\u201cThe outrageous ballot-counting issues in Broward County are un-American and unacceptable,\u201d Rep.

Instead, Scott and the NRSC argue, Bucher and her staff simply used their own judgment when determining voters' intent.

Invests $200M in private equity firm following donation to GOP Super PAC", "comment": " A FLORIDA STATE agency invested $200 million with a massive Wall Street private equity firm one week after the firm\u2019s CEO donated to a Super PAC run by Florida Gov. Rick Scott.The transactions came in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Scott, a Republican, ran the pro-Trump Super PAC at the same time he served as a trustee of the Florida agency, the State Board of Administration. The SBA manages the state\u2019s investments, about 80 percent of which are for the state pension fund\u2019s 1 million members and retirees.On September 26 of that year, Stephen Feinberg, the CEO of the sprawling private-equity firm Cerberus, donated $500,000 to Rebuilding America Now, Scott\u2019s pro-Trump Super PAC. In early October, one week later, the SBA made a $200 million commitment to a high-fee, high-risk Cerberus fund, Cerberus FSBA Levered Loan Opportunities Fund LP, according to a statement from the SBA.Feinberg made another $975,000 contribution to Scott\u2019s Super PAC one month later, on November 3, making Feinberg its fifth-largest donor.Scott is one of three trustees of the SBA, but neither the SBA investments nor the Cerberus donations appear to violate any state or federal rules. And the Cerberus investments represent a small fraction of the Florida pension fund\u2019s more than $150 billion in assets.Scott\u2019s office referred inquiries to his campaign, which did not respond to an emailed request for comment. A Cerberus spokesperson emailed a statement that said, \u201cCerberus Capital Management adheres to the strongest compliance and ethical standards and all political donations by employees are subjected to compliance review and clearance.\u201dhttps://theintercept.com/2018/10/18/rick-scott-florida-pension-fund/ "}, "replies": [" John Kuczwanski, a spokesperson for the SBA, said that the fund\u2019s decision-makers would not have been aware of the donation. \u201cNeither the Trustees nor their appointed members to the Investment Advisory Council (IAC) are involved in the selection of investments. The Trustees specifically, pursuant to Florida Statute and powers granted to them, hire the Executive Director & Chief Investment Officer to manage and make all investment decisions. Any suggestion that politics influenced the SBA\u2019s investment decision on the Cerberus FSBA Levered Loan Opportunities Fund is baseless and without merit,\u201d he said.Kuczwanski said that Cerberus did not disclose the campaign contributions made to Scott\u2019s Super PAC, adding that the SBA does not receive information about political donations and added that SBA investments are approved by internal staff, consultants, and attorneys. \u201cAny suggestion of a link between individual contributions made and SBA investment decisions would be patently false,\u201d he said.Asked about Feinberg\u2019s donations to the Scott Super PAC, ethics specialist Kathleen Clark said, \u201cPeople in investments think in terms of returns, and this is a great return\u201d for Cerberus. Clark, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, said, \u201cHow confident are Florida voters and pensioners that when Scott was making decisions as governor he was doing so on their behalf as opposed to those he was raising money from? Is he representing the people of Florida, or donors? Can we have confidence he\u2019s representing the people? This deal raises the question. Why was that the appropriate decision for the state board to make? Do we know this is in the best interest of the fund?\u201d ", " Scott has already drawn criticism for prior state investments. He is in a tight race with incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., a battle that analysts say could determine control of the Senate. Scott\u2019s involvement in Rebuilding America Now was not limited to serving as its chair. Melissa Sellers Stone, Scott\u2019s former chief of staff and adviser, was Rebuilding America Now\u2019s spokesperson. One of the Super PAC\u2019s media consultants, Alex Castellanos, told CNN that Scott \u201cknows how to win campaigns like this, and how to inspire the financial support to get them over the goal line. He\u2019s done it.\u201d(Castellanos is now advising another Scott Super PAC, New Republican, which is targeting Hispanic voters. In April, reporters from Maplight and Capital & Main revealed that Scott\u2019s New Republican Super PAC had received tens of thousands of dollars in donations from managers with business before the pension fund. In September, Maplight and Capital & Main reported that Scott has personally invested millions in firms that did business with the state pension fund.)\u201cThese kinds of shameless pay-to-play deals are inappropriate at best and illegal at worst. And it\u2019s doubly disturbing when a governor with a fiduciary duty to protect the retirement security of Florida\u2019s public-sector workers takes the bait and decides to plow their deferred wages into a high-fee private equity fund instead,\u201d said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who represents 140,000 members of the Florida pension fund.The SBA said that it has paid out over $4.9 million in fees to the Cerberus fund since the commitment was made. Fees for private equity firms like Cerberus are typically around 10,000 percent higher than for ordinary stocks and bonds, with a typical fee being 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of performance, as opposed to fees that are around 0.05 percent for index funds. ", " With that amount of money on the table, it\u2019s no surprise that the industry\u2019s relationship with public pension funds has led to scandal in the past. Former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi went to prison for getting kickbacks from private equity managers with business before the pension fund he controlled, as did the former CEO of the country\u2019s largest pension fund, CalPERS, in a scandal that engulfed some of the country\u2019s largest private equity firms.In 2015, Donald Trump criticized Jeb Bush for receiving a high-paying job at Lehman Brothers after the SBA purchased hundreds of millions in Lehman securities during Bush\u2019s tenure as Florida\u2019s governor.It is not clear that the fees private equity firms charge always translate into superior performance. Florida\u2019s 2016 Cerberus investment under Scott has yielded a return of about 7.7 percent at an annualized rate from October 2016 through the end of March 2018, according to an analysis of data from the most recent SBA performance reports. The S&P 500\u2019s annualized rate of return during the same time period was 20.1 percent.Pension funds typically report more than one performance index. The one the SBA uses to demonstrate investment growth over time translates to roughly 7.7 percent annualized for its Cerberus investment. The SBA\u2019s so-called Internal Rate of Return \u2014 which assumes compounding \u2014 for the Cerberus fund is 12.9 percent. The consulting firm McKinsey has noted industry criticism of relying on Internal Rate of Return to measure performance, saying, \u201cFor decades, finance textbooks and academics have warned that typical IRR calculations build in reinvestment assumptions that make bad projects look better and good ones look great.\u201d ", " In the aftermath of the New York and California scandals, the SEC propagated the pay-to-play rule, which bans direct contributions from alternative investment managers to elected officials overseeing pension funds. When firms violate the rule, they are banned from managing money for the pension in question for two years. The SEC, however, has not applied the rule to Super PACs.Cerberus received other, earlier investments from the SBA since Scott became governor, getting a $150 million investment in 2012, and an additional $200 million investment in 2015, SBA records show.Current SBA Executive Director Ashbel Williams took office in 2008, and served in the same role from 1991 to 1996. Williams has attracted controversy for investing SBA assets in a firm run by individuals who invested in a hedge fund where Williams had worked. Williams was cleared by Florida\u2019s ethics commission after an investigation.Williams, like all SBA executive directors, serves at the discretion of the SBA\u2019s trustees and makes investment decisions on its behalf, the agency said. By statute, the SBA trustees consist of Florida\u2019s governor, attorney general, and chief financial officer.Since Scott\u2019s election, all three positions have been held by elected Republicans. Attorney General Pam Bondi has attracted controversy for declining to investigate Trump University, even as a PAC supporting her received a $25,000 contribution from Trump\u2019s foundation. ", " Cerberus has attracted scrutiny for its ownership of the gunmaker Remington, for aggressive debt collection tactics in Europe, and for restricting referrals at its for-profit hospital chain. Trump appointed Feinberg, the Cerberus CEO, to head the federal Intelligence Advisory Board, seen as a potential conflict of interest due to Cerberus\u2019s role as a large military contractor. Cerberus owns DynCorp, which was sued in 2016 by the Justice Department for False Claims Act violations, and its employees are being investigated for allegedly defrauding the State Department. The name \u201cCerberus\u201d comes from the three-headed dog in Greek mythology that guards the Underworld.

But when it comes to managing large portfolios attention must be paid to risk appetite. The s&p could have also lost 20%For things like public pensions I'm sure the investment strategy involves more conservative investment that will not have the gain potential but neither the loss potentail, basically the goal is to grow the money but keep it safe whole doing so with means less risk which means less gains ", " This fucking dude is so corrupt its crazy how their are still people out there who support him.This is not the first controversy and it won't be the last if he retains some sort of office.

That device was constructed from a length of pipe about six inches long filled with explosive powder, and it was \u201cproactively detonated\u201d by bomb squad technicians, according to one of the officials, all of whom were briefed on the investigation.The motive of the would-be Soros bomber or bombers remained unclear, one of the officials said, adding that there had not yet been any claim of responsibility.

The Clintons and his wife have a home in Chappaqua, a suburb of New York City.

For my part I am of the opinion that Putin, as leader of the country, without doubt acts dictatorially in certain things in his own country, but regarding foreign affairs he has more brains, intellect and reason in his head than Merkel and all of the US American and EU dictatorship mighty ones. That is also proven by the idiotic sanction-action of the USA and EU dictatorship against Russia, whereby the Ukraine is a very good means to an end for that. And what object the USA pursues is also clear, namely it consists of an extensive war, which they want to bring over Europe and which could quickly escalate to a fourth World War. There have been three of them already, if the First World War is also counted, which took place from 1756 to 1763, however is only referred to as the Seven Years\u2019 War, but effectively was a World War.

The Ukraine has enormous financial difficulties, which is clear, as is also clear that the USA and the EU dictatorship take advantage of it and sneak into the country in order to annex it one day. However, quite especially the USA is interested in penetrating into Europe and displaying their might, whereby a malicious war will be a suitable means, if it indeed should go so far. The fact is, as you have told me several time privately, that the long term fundamental ambition of the USA consists of bringing all of Europe and Russia as well as eventually the entire world under their thumb and thus enslaving it and profiting endlessly from that with Gewalt and coercion. Thereby human lives are all the same to the warmongers of the USA, because they effectively walk over dead bodies, in fact no matter if they are thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions.

And if such a war is provoked through the USA and the EU dictatorship, then it will go off with a big bang, namely because Russia will be forced to fight back and will not be disinclined to show its strength as a well-equipped nuclear might, whereby then the prophecy would be fulfilled, which states that Europe would perish in an atomic fire and also the USA would suffer a similar fate. And the fact that such a war is being provoked by the USA and the EU dictatorship is beyond doubt, because both are absolutely crazy and completely overstrained in regard to a healthy policy, because neither in the USA nor in the EU dictatorship exist leaders that are endowed with reason.

Unfortunately therewith is also the fact that \u2013 apart from elderly human beings, who still experienced the last world war in some impressive form \u2013 the present populace of the USA, Germany and the EU dictatorship and so forth, only have remote experience in matters of war, such as through television, radio and newspapers, consequently they are not affected by it themselves. As a result they behave towards it rather indifferently, unconcernedly and can simply switch off their thoughts and feelings without assuming responsibility themselves in order to do something against it. In fact the majority of this populace does nothing, rather simply allows the mighty ones and other responsible ones of the state and so forth, to instigate wars. However, even in nations that are only partially free it would be easy for the peoples to go onto the streets and demonstrate for peace, as well as to wake up the indifferent ones and all human beings in general from their lethargy with purposive texts, and to instruct them about the effective reality and its truth. Thereby however also pressure must be applied to the politicians unfit for office, so that they begin to think and act logically, drop their cravings for might, lead the people to freedom and peace rightly and protect them from war. And at the present time precisely this is in the foreground as a consequence of the criminal and even felonious machinations of the USA and the EU dictatorship, which is why the concerned peoples themselves have to take measures against it before it is too late. And if nothing is done by the peoples themselves and the might-greedy ones of the state are left to rule and nothing is undertaken against their might-behaviour and their war mongering machinations, then it will indeed come to a world war.

Especially at the present time, when by means of the profound hate delusion of the Federal Chancellor Merkel the \u2018refugee-welcome-culture\u2019 was activated in order to thereby overstrain Germany and Europe and allow them to collapse, various people appear with articles in newspapers in order to make public their observations in regard to this woman.

Sounds oxymoronic and smells like bullshit ", " >>300280>I'll just read the headline and not the article ", " >>300108OP SUCKS MAJOR COCKS AND BASICALLY, HE IS THE WORST.Here is the copy/pasted article:Millions of American workers believe they are bound by contracts they are not actually bound by, according to University of Maryland Smith Business School\u2019s Evan Starr, and this means less earnings for workers. Starr spoke at length on the subject at the recent Aspen Institute summit and to us on Twitter.While non-competes are required by employers to protect trade secrets, they are found everywhere, including regular minimum wage workers and volunteers. Around 20% America\u2019s 130 million workers are in a non-compete right now, and 40% have signed a non-compete at some point in their lives.What Starr has found is that workers are acting as though they are bound by employee contracts based solely on their false belief that the contracts are always enforceable. In many states the contracts are not.\u201c[W]orkers are chilled just by the existence of the contract regardless of whether it\u2019s enforceable or not, and when you ask workers, \u2018What do you know about the law,\u2019 most of them don\u2019t know what the law is, but their default is they believe that contracts they put their name on are enforceable, and they abide by them, even in states like California where they wouldn\u2019t be enforceable if they went to court. ", " >>300279nah,most immigrants are from el salvador and other central american countries>most of the population is in poverty, yearly a 1/1000 of population is killed ", " >>300342\u201cWhen it comes to workers choosing to move between jobs what we see is the use of these provisions appears to be what matters, not necessarily their enforceability in court.\u201dAnd, according to Starr, one of the results is workers making less money throughout their careers.\u201cI did one study where we tracked workers over 8 years of their career. We had every single worker in 30 states over roughly a 20-year period, and what we found was that if you start your career in kind of an average enforcing state, you are going to earn 5% lower earnings relative to a non-enforcing state like California, over those 8 years, regardless of where you end up, regardless of where you go.\u201dNumbers are uncertain as to exactly how many Americans are affected in this way, because states vary so much in regards to non-compete enforceability.\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous heterogeneity across the US in what states will do. In some states you can be fired from your job, and if you get sued over the violation of a non-compete it can still be enforced even though you were fired. In other states it won\u2019t be enforced, and everyone else is kind of in the middle.\u201dBut Starr said it was safe to say that many millions of Americans assume they are bound by non-binding contracts. In California, to use a state he studied recently, there are approximately 20 million workers, so around 4 million may be involved in non-binding contracts. Those numbers can be roughly extrapolated to the rest of the 130 million U.S. workers who live in the other states.\u201cAnd that number is most certainly an underestimate given that non-competes are used for workers in states that wouldn\u2019t enforce them for such workers, even though they would enforce them for other workers,\u201d Starr added.

It literally makes no sense to create fuel and then literally dump it into the environment by burying it ", " oh look a dumb nigger, please tell me how converting carbon in the air into gasoline and then burning it in an endless cycle is going to halt the ongoing destruction of the entire fucking planet ", " >>298748listen, I know its hard with your brain problems, but try and think. The problem is caused by too much CO2 in the atmosphere. If you take the CO2 out of the atmosphere and put it back in the Earth, that can stall or reverse the problem depending on the scale. If you start burning it, it goes back in the atmosphere in an endless loop ensuring no gains. But this won't mean the end of fracking and drilling for oil, so the warming will still be increasing ", " >>298751SurplusOfFuelthis means the exact same thing you just said only we don't have to bury it, we just hold onto it until it needs to be burned later.I know you probably don't understand simple math, but as long as a surplus is maintained we will reduce overall carbon and we don't have to bury something that can later be sold ", " >>298752Maybe for a transient need.

", " >>298793Not really. You're saying we can save up gasoline, years and years worth of it, and somehow maintain that stash while also using it. You cannot get the benefits of storing it after it is burned.To put it another way, it's not a surplus, it's a payment against the original carbon debt that was racked up when the petroleum was first dug up and burnt. Every time the storage is dug into it's a step backwards into that original debt. ", " >>298794>Every time the storage is dug into it's a step backwards into that original debtYes.But you seem to be unable to understand the simple process I am speaking of.If a quantity of co2 is turned back into fuel, and a lesser quantity of fuel is burned than what was extracted (SURPLUS) then the net gain will be negative and thus improve the situation.Why the fuck would we bury the fuel only to dig up more later??To use your analogy, we have a debt of co2 to repay. If we repay more co2 than we consume, than the amount owed lessens.Surely you can understand that if we did this to scale and in enough volume than it wouldn't be necessary to give up driving or heating.Much of the co2 has been building up for over a century. If we were to get to the point where only maybe 5 years worth of co2 were present, and the excess had been turned back into fuel, we wouldn't have to live in preindustrial society to continue progressing as mankind.

First, the environment is not under threat.

In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether \"a leading North American journal of cultural studies \u2013 whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross \u2013 [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions\".[2]>The article, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\",[3] was published in the Social Text spring/summer 1996 \"Science Wars\" issue. It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.[4][5] On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax.[2]>The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of commentary about the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of Social Text; and whether Social Text had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.

It includes a few new playable characters, and one of those, Toadette, can don a crown power-up and turn into a Toadette-Peach hybrid dubbed Peachette.>Fans didn't take long to imagine what might happen if other Mario series characters put that same crown on and transformed into Princess Peach hybrids, particularly Bowser. Thus, Bowsette was born in a wild flurry of detailed fan art (and we thank NintendoLife for this SFW gallery of examples). But as Nintendo itself revealed on Friday, fans' creation wasn't all that original... as Nintendo had already toyed with the idea itself.>A new official book from Nintendo, titled The Art of Super Mario Odyssey, premiered in Japan this week and offers a deep dive into concept art for the colorful 2017 game. On Friday, one of the book's buyers noticed a comic-styled storyboard within the book and posted the discovery on Twitter, as shown above.

"}, "replies": [" >This storyboard sequence implies that Bowser would only wield it once, to embody Princess Peach and make her look like a Peach-Bowser hybrid.>While Princess Peach (formerly Princess Toadstool in the West) has appeared in a variety of Mario games as a playable character, her access to Mario-like power-ups and transformations has generally been limited, with the exception of Super Mario 3D Land and World letting her throw fireballs and don a cat suit. Peach was famously limited to a series of \"emotion\" powers in the 2006 DS game Super Princess Peach\u2014which allowed her to cry or explode in anger as a \"power-up.\">The character's longtime status as either a sideline character or an \"emotional\" one arguably drove Bowsette fever this month, with fan art focusing on Bowser's more muscular, less svelte figure. In essence, the approach lets Peach look a little less Barbie-proportioned. Perhaps this official look at one Nintendo experiment is a sign that the big N itself is interested in a twist on typical Princess Peach assumptions. (Consider this our vote for those experiments landing in an eventual Mario game.)>The rest of the Super Mario Odyssey art book appears to contain an incredible variety of hand-drawn designs and concepts for what did (and didn't) make it into the Switch game's final version.

His staff talked him out of it. Source of the Axios leak is unknown and possibly unrelated. "}, "replies": [" >>292994 At the beginning of one of the most consequential weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, an enormous smoke bomb was detonated in the news cycle when Axios, deeply wired in Trump\u2019s West Wing, reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had \u201coffered to resign.\u201d Quickly, a head-spinning array of conflicting accounts were put forth: had he been fired? Was he heading to the White House to be fired\u2014or was he going to a regularly scheduled meeting? Finally, Sarah Huckabee Sanders brought a measure of clarity by tweeting that whatever was going to happen to Rosenstein would happen on Thursday, when the president returned from New York.Fall the morning\u2019s madness, there may have been an underlying logic. Over the weekend, as Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s prospects appeared increasingly imperiled, Trump faced two tactical options, both of them fraught. One was to cut Kavanaugh loose. But he was also looking for ways to dramatically shift the news cycle away from his embattled Supreme Court nominee. According to a source briefed on Trump\u2019s thinking, Trump decided that firing Rosenstein would knock Kavanaugh out of the news, potentially saving his nomination and Republicans\u2019 chances for keeping the Senate. \u201cThe strategy was to try and do something really big,\u201d the source said. The leak about Rosenstein\u2019s resignation could have been the result, and it certainly had the desired effect of driving Kavanaugh out of the news for a few hours. ", " >>292995Rosenstein still has his job, at least until Thursday, leaving open multiple possibilities regarding the underlying reality. Regardless, Trump has wanted to fire Rosenstein from the moment he read the New York Times article that reported Rosenstein had discussed secretly tape-recording Trump and rallying Cabinet secretaries to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. (Rosenstein has denied the account.) Some outside advisers, including Sean Hannity, have cautioned that the Times story was a trap to get Trump to fire Rosenstein and trigger a Saturday Night Massacre-like crisis that, however temporarily successful, would leave Democrats holding almost all the cards.The confusion surrounding Rosenstein\u2019s tenure may not give Kavanaugh a reprieve. In public, Trump continues to voice support for his embattled Supreme Court nominee, telling reporters at the United Nations earlier this morning that he stands with Kavanaugh \u201call the way.\u201d But in private, Trump is growing increasingly frustrated by being mired in a deteriorating political situation beyond his control. On Monday morning, a Republican briefed on Trump\u2019s thinking said the president has been considering pulling Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. ", " >>292997According to the source, Trump allies are imploring him to cut Kavanaugh loose for the sake of saving Republicans\u2019 electoral chances in the midterms. The argument these advisers are making is that if Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination fails, demoralized Republicans will stay home in November, and Democrats will take the House and the Senate and initiate impeachment proceedings. The end result: Trump will be removed from office. \u201cThe stakes are that high,\u201d the source said. Another Republican adviser told me: \u201cTrump is very worried now, and is finally waking up that it\u2019s the end of his presidency if he loses the Senate.\u201d Trump\u2019s outside allies are advising him to nominate Amy Coney Barrett and fast-track her confirmation before the midterms. \u201cSome in the White House think you can only appoint a woman now,\u201d a former administration official told me. An outside adviser added: \u201cDemocrats won\u2019t be able to pivot fast enough to attack her, since she\u2019s a woman.\u201dEven before Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer reported Deborah Ramirez\u2019s account that Kavanaugh exposed his penis without her consent at Yale (which Kavanaugh emphatically denies), Trump has been unhappy with how Senate Republicans are handling the nomination process. According to sources, Trump blamed Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley for agreeing to delay Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony until Thursday. \u201cHe thinks they look weak,\u201d a Republican briefed on Trump\u2019s thinking said. A White House official told me Trump was also angry that Senate Republicans waited hours to respond to Ford\u2019s interview with The Washington Post, creating a vacuum in the news cycle that allowed the narrative to take hold. \u201cYou don\u2019t let that happen,\u201d the official said. ", " >>292998Last week, White House advisers, including Johnny DeStefano, implored Trump not to attack Dr. Ford. A source said Bill Shine and Corey Lewandowski were pushing a more aggressive approach. Trump listened to the moderates until Friday, until he reverted to form and tweeted: \u201cI have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.\u201dAs Kavanaugh\u2019s poll numbers plummet, Trump is telling people in private that he was never a fan of Kavanaugh\u2019s selection, sources said. According to two people who\u2019ve spoken with Trump recently, Trump complained that establishment Republicans foisted Kavanaugh on him, because they reasoned Kavanaugh would unite the party in November. According to one former West Wing official, Trump\u2019s first choice was Judge Thomas Hardiman, who served on the federal bench alongside Trump\u2019s sister Maryanne Trump Barry.Trump is keeping his distance from the nominee. A White House official said he hasn\u2019t spoken with Kavanaugh in recent days. \u201cThis is Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s fight,\u201d the White House official said. ", " Sounds exactly like something Trump would do. Like how he revoked security clearence of former officials to distract from his treason in Helsinki. Kavanaugh or the Republicans are fucked now with the 2nd and 3rd accuser since they either slam it through and feel the wrath of women at the midterms or throw Kavaugh under the bus and hope they can jam someone down the American people's throat during the lame duck session or next year's congress.

If the House finds enough probable cause to bring charges the case then moves to the Senate to be investigated and a trial is conducted by the complete Senate where they determine guilt and administer punishment which can be anything from removal from office to criminal charges. Conviction requires 67 Senators though, so its a very high bar and nearly unreachable in most cases. Nixon is arguably the only President who could have passed that threshold but he resigned before it went through.Interesting thought but I don't think presidential pardons can pardon charges arising from impeachment proceedings.

Patty Murray, D.-Wash., and obtained by Yahoo News, HHS Secretary Alex Azar outlined his plan to reallocate up to $266 million in funding for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).Nearly $80 million of that money will come from other refugee support programs within ORR, which have seen their needs significantly diminished as the Trump administration makes drastic cuts to the annual refugee numbers. The rest is being taken from other programs, including $16.7 million from Head Start, $5.7 million from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program and $13.3 million from the National Cancer Institute. Money is also being diverted from programs dedicated to mental and maternal health, women\u2019s shelters and substance abuse. According to data from the Office of Refugee Resettlement obtained by Yahoo News, there were 13,312 immigrant children in federal custody as of Wednesday, Sept. 19, with ORR\u2019s existing facilities at 92 percent capacity.The latest figures demonstrate the continued growth of this population just one week after the New York Times reported that the number of detained immigrant children in the U.S. has soared to record highs over the last year, from 2,400 children in May of 2017 to 12,800 earlier this month. https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-immigrant-children-detention-hhs-cuts-funds-programs-like-cancer-research-230259583.html "}, "replies": [" Last week, HHS confirmed its plan to extend use of an emergency shelter in Tornillo, Texas, for the third time since it opened in June, and expand capacity at the \u201ctent city\u201d from 400 to 3,800 beds. The estimated cost of operating such emergency facilities is $750 per child per day \u2014 approximately three times the cost of a regular ORR shelter.\u201cWe support making sure ORR gets all the resources they need to help kids,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and one of 19 Democratic senators who wrote Azar in July expressing concern over \u201ca troubling pattern of chaotic, ideologically driven and opaque policymaking\u201d in ORR\u2019s unaccompanied child program.Van Hollen told Yahoo News Wednesday that the notification of the reallocation of funds to the Unaccompanied Alien Children program leaves key questions unanswered.Van Hollen said he was questioning \u201cthe reasons for need for additional money and how much of it is because you have more UACs coming across the border and how much is due to the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy?\u201d He urged the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies call Azar and other administration officials to a hearing on how the money would be used in the UAC program, and the impacts on the programs being cut.\u201cThe American public is entitled to facts behind the policies here,\u201d he said.This is hardly the first time HHS has had to move money around to accommodate an influx of unaccompanied immigrant children in its care. But although the number of unaccompanied immigrant children apprehended along the border U.S. in fiscal year 2018 is on track to surpass that of the previous year, the rate is still well below those seen in 2014, when the flow of unaccompanied children across the border reached crisis-level proportions, or during the subsequent peak in 2016. ", " And while the family separation policy has contributed to the demand for additional beds, the main reason is that children are spending more time in custody before they are released to a sponsor or returned home.So far this month, discharges from custody have been running at a rate of around 0.6 to 0.7 percent per day, less than half the 1.5 percent shown in reports obtained by Yahoo News from early April and from late July. Meanwhile the intake of unaccompanied immigrant children into ORR facilities has remained relatively steady, with average daily referrals from Customs and Border Protection in the range of 100 to 200.\u201cThis is not a story about a historically large surge in arrivals,\u201d said Mark Greenberg, a former official with HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families. \u201cThe story is fundamentally about a significant slowdown in children being released from care.\u201dGreenberg, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, worked at the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which includes ORR, from 2009 to 2017, serving as acting assistant secretary during the last three years of the Obama administration. He said that even during the major surges of 2014 and 2016, the goal was to keep the average daily discharge rate at 3 percent. \u201cMost typically, the discharge rate was somewhere in the 2s, with significant concern if it fell below 2,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was certainly not below 1.\u201dIn his letter notifying Sen. Murray of the transfer of funds, Azar stated that, based on the current growth pattern and what he described as \u201can increased length of time needed to safely release unaccompanied alien children to sponsors, HHS is preparing for the trend of high capacity to continue.\u201d ", " The majority of children housed in such facilities come to the U.S. on their own from the northern triangle countries of Central America \u2014 Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras \u2014 often fleeing gang violence. However, during the months that border officials were separating families under the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy, children who\u2019d actually entered the country with a parent were being reclassified as \u201cunaccompanied\u201d and referred to ORR, in a chaotic process that left children stranded, in some cases while their parents were being deported. The subsequent effort to reunite those children, which has required the diversion of staff from ORR and elsewhere throughout the Administration for Children and Families, has likely contributed to the slowdown in discharges.But that\u2019s not the only reason. Months before the family separation crisis came to a head, unaccompanied minors were already spending extended periods of time in ORR facilities, which are intended to house children temporarily until a parent or suitable adult sponsor can be identified.In March, Yahoo News reported that a new policy requiring ORR Director Scott Lloyd to personally approve the release of certain children resulted in many remaining in custody longer, even after a proper sponsor had been approved. Lawyers representing the children and immigration advocates said they were being falsely suspected of gang affiliations. More and more aged out of custody and were transferred to adult detention facilities on their 18th birthdays. In response to a lawsuit by the New York Civil Liberties Union, a New York federal judge in June determined that Lloyd had violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act by enacting the policy almost immediately upon being sworn in as director, \u201cwith no record demonstrating the need for change,\u201d and ordered him to halt it. ", " At the same time, parents and other potential adult sponsors who might have taken the children in were being frightened away by the environment of heightened enforcement under Trump. More than 400 people were arrested by ICE last summer in an operation targeting parents of unaccompanied immigrant kids. A rumor spread about an agreement among ORR, ICE and CBP that would require ORR to inform ICE with the names, fingerprints and other personal details of not only proposed sponsors but all adults in the household. Even before the policy was implemented in June, the prospect was deterring potential sponsors from coming forward.\u201cAs soon as the announcement was made that they were going to do this, it had an immediate chilling effect,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, policy director at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which provides pro bono legal services to immigrant children.\u201cWe started seeing kids linger in care longer before it officially went into effect,\u201d said Podkul, noting that KIND also received calls from the Honduran Embassy asking whether it should advise Honduran citizens in the U.S. against coming forward to sponsor a child.Matthew Albence, the executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations at ICE, validated these fears during a hearing about family detention before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, stating that under the policy ICE has apprehended 41 prospective sponsors so far.Greenberg explained that the process of releasing unaccompanied minors into the care of adult sponsors has always involved a bit of a balancing act.\u201cThere are lots of tradeoffs and judgments involved in that process,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, [it\u2019s] important to be sure that children are being released in safe and appropriate settings. On the other hand, there\u2019s a strong interest in children being released to the least restrictive environment quickly, so long as it is safe to do.\u201d ", " Greenberg said that during his time at ORR, routine fingerprinting for parents seeking to regain custody of their children was not required, since ORR \u201cvery rarely received any information from fingerprinting that they didn\u2019t otherwise get from public records checks for criminal history.\u201d And it was \u201cclear that fingerprinting was a significant deterrent for parents coming forward.\u201d\u201cThe more you create a situation where children are more likely to go to distant relatives or nonrelatives, the more dangerous it is for children,\u201d said Abigail Trillin, a staff attorney at the San Francisco-based Legal Services for Children. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see undocumented folks not going to come forward, therefore children either stay in detention or go to more distant people who might happen to be documented,\u201d she said, a \u201csituation that is at best challenging and at worst dangerous for children.\u201d----The cost of jailing so many children under Trump\u2019s inhumane immigration policies has gotten so high that the administration plans to take money away from crucial health programs just to pay to house the growing number of detained children, according to a new report.The Trump administration is currently housing a record number of detained immigrant children, and more are added to the system every day, creating a need for additional shelters and a demand for more funding to deal with the skyrocketing costs.Instead of, say, not putting more kids in jails, the administration is looking to cover the cost of jailing an increasing number of children by slashing funding for other programs \u2014 like cancer research, HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal health services, and mental health and substance abuse programs.According to a plan laid out by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in a letter obtained by Yahoo News, the Trump administration is going to divert an estimated $266 million away from other programs to fund detention centers through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). ", " Most of that money will come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, while about $80 million will be reallocated from refugee assistance programs within ORR as the administration continues to turn away more and more people seeking refuge from violence, war, persecution, and other desperate circumstances.Currently, the administration has more than 13,000 immigrant children in detention centers. That\u2019s a record-high number and it\u2019s rising rapidly, with five times as many children in detention today compared to last summer.Many of these detained children crossed the border by themselves and would typically be reunited quickly with relatives. But thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s cruel new posture toward immigrants and the overall chaos of the system, many of those relatives are too scared to come forward or can\u2019t be located at all, causing the children to be detained for longer periods of time and creating a bottleneck in the system.On top of that, the Trump administration\u2019s inhumane practice of forcibly separating families has produced an entirely new crisis involving traumatized children who were ripped from their parents with no plans to reunite them.As The New York Times recently described, \u201cThe separated children injected a new degree of chaos into the facilities, according to several shelter operators, who spoke anonymously because they are barred by the government from speaking to the news media. The children were younger and more traumatized than those the shelters were used to dealing with, and they arrived without a plan for when they could be released or to whom.\u201dAnd apparently, the Trump administration also had no plans to pay for them \u2014 so now they\u2019re taking money from cancer research just so Trump can keep throwing kids in jails.

In that disturbance, two gangs \u2014 the Bloods and the Cutthroats \u2014 began stabbing each other with knives in a clash over smuggled contraband, a source said. Only one officer was in the control room \u2014 responsible for supervising scores of inmates at the time it happened in G Dorm of the main building, one of the sources said.Thursday\u2019s murder happened in the prison\u2019s annex \u2014 a building separate from the main building where the armed battle took place later in the day, the source said. The annex and the main building are run as two distinct prisons, but they are part of the same compound, with a total capacity of about 3,000 inmates. Columbia houses some of the most violent inmates in the state, prison officials said.A spokesman for the Department of Corrections identified the slain inmate as Larry Mark, 58. Mark was serving a life sentence for a murder he committed in Broward County in 1981, according to his prison record. When Mark was 20, he and a co-defendant hailed a cab, then crushed the driver\u2019s skull by bludgeoning him repeatedly with a heavy object. The fruits of their crime: $35 and a wedding ring.The department confirmed that Mark\u2019s next of kin had been notified.However, neither FDC, nor the Florida Department of Law Enforcement \u2014 which is investigating the murder \u2014 https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article218386225.html "}, "replies": [" would provide further details or confirm the circumstances of the killing. They also would not provide the name of the attacker.Two of the prison sources said the cellmate became angry at Mark for pestering him. After strangling him, he cut off his ear and gouged out his eyeballs, three sources confirmed. He put the ear on a string around his neck, showing it off to several inmates, before morning breakfast in the chow hall, the sources said. He left the eyeballs in a cup in the cell and told other prisoners that he intended to either eat or drink them later.It\u2019s not clear why corrections officers failed to notice that one inmate was missing from the count before breakfast.There were unconfirmed reports that the killer had recently been transferred to Columbia from Florida State Prison where he had been on Death Row.Often, inmates who have violent histories or are considered a threat to other inmates are housed separately from the rest of the population.A corrections officer, who did not witness either incident but was close to those involved in the investigations, said that officers on the compound are rattled by the explosion of violence that they have been struggling to control with limited resources and short staffing. He described dorms staffed by a single officer, responsible for supervising hundreds of inmates, many of them gang members under the influence of the powerful drug K2, or synthetic marijuana, which is being smuggled or dropped into the prison, sometimes by drones.The officer, a veteran of the department, described a prison that is so short-staffed that inmates have been able to conjure up disturbances so that when officers are summoned to that skirmish, prisoners in other dorms are able to traffic in drugs and other contraband freely.He said most officers at the prison are young and inexperienced, making them easy prey for the gangs, whose members offer them bounties to help with trafficking their contraband. ", " \u201cThey just hire anybody now,\u2019\u2019 the veteran officer said. \u201cThey just come in and smuggle drugs and they get caught and nothing really happens to them.\u2019\u2019The officer also revealed that Columbia is part of a pilot program in which some officers are now armed with Tasers. FDC confirmed the new program is at the main unit, but not the annex.\u201cI have mixed feelings about whether the Tasers are a good thing or a bad thing,\u2019\u2019 the officer said. \u201cIf you have an inmate cutting ears off and strangling someone, it\u2019s only going to take one inmate to jump a staff member and use that Taser for the wrong reasons,\u2019\u2019 he said.In 2016, a corrections officer was jumped and stabbed at Columbia, and in 2012, Sgt. Ruben Thomas, 24, was stabbed and killed by an inmate at the prison.Short-staffing has resulted in fewer cell searches, making it easier to conceal shanks and other makeshift weapons, said one source.FDC Secretary Julie Jones declined to be interviewed for this article. As in the past, she provided a written statement calling such violence \u201cintolerable.\u2019\u2019FDLE has four other open death investigations at the prison and recent reports indicate that inmates who have died at Columbia had been smoking K2 in their cells prior to their deaths.The annex dorm where Mark was killed was staffed by one officer assigned to the control room. A sergeant \u2014 also assigned to the dorm where it happened \u2014 was unable to make his rounds because he was working other posts in the compound, the source said.\u201cYou have one staff member in there, in the control room and all he does is stay in that room, pushing buttons, and answering phones. He can\u2019t leave that area,\u2019\u2019 the officer explained. ", " \u201cThe sergeant is supposed to stay in that building and do the 30-minute checks, but he is pulled off to do other security during recreation, moving inmates to the chow hall, etc., so the officer in the control room is left alone and all he can do is observe through the windows of the control room \u2014 he can\u2019t see in the cells.\u2019\u2019The killer had been rumored to be on Death Row before he was transferred to Columbia, but FDC did not provide his name or his status.Aubrey Land, a former inspector with the Florida prison system, said that gangs are controlling many of the state\u2019s 50 prisons.\u201cThere are criminal gangs operating in every facility in the state of Florida and it is contributing to the K2 deaths and the violence and has been for many years,\u2019\u2019 said Land, who is now a prison and jail consultant.Inmate deaths are at an all-time high in the Florida prison system, and murders and inmate-on-inmate violence has exploded, records show.\u201cThe FDC has continuously ignored the safety of our staff and inmates. Our next governor\u2019s greatest challenge will be to address this lingering problem,\u2019\u2019 Land said.It is difficult to confirm the seriousness of the incidents at Florida prisons, since the agency rarely provides details, often citing security concerns or health privacy laws as reasons for limiting what information it will provide to the public. The Miami Herald is often notified about the problems by staff at the prisons themselves, or by other local law enforcement agencies or emergency teams that respond to the prisons.In recent months, the Florida Legislature has announced cutbacks in programs that prison advocates say are essential to rehabilitating inmates and keeping them busy. In May, the prison agency said it would have to cut mental health, substance abuse and re-entry programs to help make up for a $50 million shortfall in its healthcare and pharmaceuticals budgets. The cuts would also include prison chaplains and librarians. ", " Three recent outside audits of the department concluded that dangerous staffing levels leave the agency vulnerable to inmate disruptions at its 49 prisons. The agency loses about one-third of its corrections officers each year, according to the reports, and those who replace them are often young and inexperienced, with little or no training. Approximately one-third of the agency\u2019s corrections officers are trainees.Full statement by Julie Jones, FDC\u2019s secretary:\u201cAny loss of life at the hands of an inmate is intolerable, and we are working with our partners at FDLE to investigate this death and ensure anyone responsible is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.Florida corrections officers have an extremely difficult job, and we ask and expect a lot of them, despite the staffing challenges that exist at our institutions. The nature of this work is inherently dangerous, but I know that our more than 17,000 dedicated officers are committed to our public safety mission and do an outstanding job, day and night, to supervise the 96,000 inmates in our custody.\u201d ", " >>289870Been a while.

There is no truth in this document.\u201dOn Sunday, Afriforum CEO Ernest Roets confirmed that the two farms - Salaitna and Lukin - were the first two to be targeted.He said: \u201cSo the debate about the authenticity of the list is settled then?

And I will separate them out into two broad categories. First, what they are/have. The \"positive\" category. They are categorized primarily by their occupation. Whether you agree with the view that the south african government is \"anti white\" or not, no one denies that by and large the majority of the boer population are farmers. It's one of the reasons that Russia specifically is offering them refuge, russia has a lot of uncultivated land that they would love to see tamed. Every country needs food for their people, and that means they need farmers. There are even a lack of farmers in the US at the moment.The second category would be the negatives, or specifically the lack thereof. It's been documented that a large portion of \"syrian refugees\" are illiterate. The Afrikaners, and Boers, are not. They have a low crime rate as well, and whether you wish to argue that it's because race, or wealth, it doesn't really matter here, as they have both of what people consider \"the good side\" of it. As to link concerning the refugee illiteracy, here's a soft article on it:https://www.huffingtonpost.com/markus-ziener/germany-and-refugees-the-_b_9618046.htmlI should add that the languages these South African Whites speak is either the same, or largely related to most the western languages. Deutsch, Frence, English, etc.And lastly, to address that other anon's assertions \"they're white\", to a degree that is true as well. I won't speak on the merits or failures of diversity, integration, or anything on that matter, but I do believe that most will agree that visual similarity means less hurdles to social integration, even for something as simple as height or weight.Do any of these explain my view / answer your questions, or should I go into further detail? ", " >>282355There's probably some sociological foundation to that.Because you're talking about socioeconomic status and education, not bodily melanin content, as if that automatically makes you a better member of society.I still find the thread as a whole shitposty on the premise alone. Let's do some history.The problem arises from one of the first Apartheid laws, the 1913, Natives Land Act, which banned Africans (essentially anyone who was not an Afrikaaner/Boer) from owning land, aside from a few reserves making up about 10% of South Africa's arable territory.As a result of this, even after Apartheid's end, 80% of farmers own 4% of farmland - it's wealth segregation on a drastic level, and it's causing serious economic problems.What sort of problems? Essentially every symptom of Soviet Collectivization that arises from top-down agricultural control. Remember the Soviet famines? The ANC tried to buy it off of the rich landowners but they started charging absurd prices (once again abusing their monopoly), so the govt said 'fuckit' and started siezing land on the basis that the 1913 law that apportioned it in the first place was both racist and unfair to the populace.It's literally an anti-collectivization measure - the only reason it can even be VIEWED as racial revenge is because the problem was CAUSED by racism.

Idiotic, harebrained racist policies murdered the free market in South Africa, and as a result the country's agriculture industry is on the brink of collapse.

If you have evidence for or against either of those positions, feel free to post it and we can discuss this further. Otherwise this will just be partisan shitflinging and no one will come out any wiser from the experience. ", " The amount of Judaism in this thread is off the charts.

You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile).

Perhaps reporters could have bypassed the executive branch spokespeople to talk to CIA officers directly, but that also might be beyond reach (requires leaks from the CIA, requires the leaker to be one of the guys who has evidence to the contrary) and doing so would have required them to operate under the assumption that the administration was lying about the results (remember that post 9/11 Bush had soaring approval numbers and therefore the confidence of the American people).Also, as the old adage goes, don't shoot the messenger. You can't blame the media, especially American media, for relaying the message of the American government, it would be a dereliction of duty on their part to ignore what the American government was saying, especially when they didn't have the resources to prove that the administration was lying.

Trudeau also reminds his newest minister about the task of dealing with illegal immigration \u2014 although Trudeau refers to the phenomenon as \u201cirregular immigration.\u201dBlair is also tasked with implementing the Liberal government\u2019s legalization of marijuana that comes into effect in matter of months and assessing a growing opioid crisis in the country.So far, Blair\u2019s only initiative to deal with the influx of illegals deliver funding to put the would-be asylum seekers into hotels.Ever since the July 22 mass shooting, Trudeau has toyed with the concept of further increasing Canada\u2019s already strict gun control. Toronto Mayor John Tory has actually asked for a handgun ban in the city.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at things that have been done around the world, things that have been done in other jurisdictions, looking at the best evidence, the best data, to make the right decisions to make sure that we are ensuring our citizens, our communities are safe into the future,\u201d https://dailycaller.com/2018/08/29/trudeau-study-handgun-assault-weapons-ban/ "}, "replies": [" Watch as gun crime stays the same.

Interesting that the shooting at parliament hill a few years ago was supposedly all about the mental health issues of the shooter whereas now It's lawful gun owners fault even though the crazy fuck in Toronto didn't even get his gun legally. It's so exhausting to speak out against shit like this in Canada because the current political paradigm here is such that anyone who gives voice to views even approaching center (even just disagreeing with liberal party polocy) publicly can be dismissed as evil, stupid or a willfully terrible human being. Still, this is only the suggestion of a law and the last push on gun control failed miserably but then again this is post-social media Canada so it's going to be difficult to convince people to actually do anything. They can't go all out though because taking the shotguns and long rifles would apparently interfere with Native hunting rights and native people as a political entity are pretty well untouchable right now. We'll probably lose handguns which is shitty even though it's already kind of a huge pain in the ass to own one if you live in a city but I'd rather jump every hoop than give up the ability to own one.

Many speculated that it could have been a micrometeoroid strike. However, Rogozin, the director general of the Roscosmos state-run space corporation told reporters otherwise.\u201cWe are considering all the theories,\u201d Rogozin said. \u201cThe one about a meteorite impact has been rejected because the spaceship\u2019s hull was evidently impacted from inside.

DNC spokesperson Daniel Wessel called Trump\u2019s move \u201cyet another slap in the face to American workers.\u201dOf course, the GOP tax scam was always about making the rich richer, whereas most government employees are solidly middle-class workers. ", " In a review of SEC filings, Politico found wealthy corporate executives \u201chave been profiting handsomely by selling shares since Trump signed the law on Dec. 22 and slashed corporate tax rates to 21 percent.\u201dBig banks are also joining the celebration, as Trump\u2019s tax giveaway fueled record-breaking second quarter profits of more than $60 billion. According to Reuters, that\u2019s a 25 percent increase over last year.While Trump lavishes corporate America with deficit-financed kickbacks, regular workers are left out in the cold.Wages, adjusted for inflation, are lower in July 2018 than they were a year ago, before the tax scam became law. And now Trump is determined to leave another set of working-class families, including park rangers and social workers who help veterans, without a pay raise.In Trump\u2019s America, CEOs, bankers, and Wall Street millionaires come first and take the most. Workers \u2014 whether in the private sector or toiling for Uncle Sam \u2014 are consistently left behind.As for the military Trump 'joked' about saying they shouldn't take a raise if they were 'real patriots' https://shareblue.com/trump-soldiers-real-patriots-wouldnt-take-pay-raise/ ", " >>284985In this case it is a slap in the face to workers who expect to get a raise, but don't, especially after Republicans passed the Trump Tower Kick Back in an unnecessary and financially long term crippling plan of giving away money to billionaires and globalist corporations, and then claiming we don't have any money to pay people.This is probably revenge by Trump because a Federal Judge struck down almost all his executive orders in his war against Unions.https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-executive-order-federal-unions-court-ruling-public-sector-unions-552d767cf8d3/ ", " For years its been \"Government workers make too much\" so now that Trump is doing something about it \"Those poor government workers, I can't believe Trump is so evil\"....JFC the guy could cure cancer and some people would complain because cancer has a right to live ", " >>284996Federal workers are literally the laziest employees in the US.

Devin Nunes pushed to expose the identity of an FBI informant involved in the Russia investigation earlier this year, officials from the intelligence community warned that their actions could have grave consequences, both for the informant\u2019s security as well as for intelligence collection more broadly.Those consequences are already being realized, as CIA sources in Russia have reportedly gone quiet ahead of the 2018 midterms, leaving U.S. intelligence agencies in the dark about the Kremlin\u2019s plans to interfere in the elections and potentially other sectors of American society.According to The New York Times, CIA informants who provide critical information to the U.S. government from inside Russia have fallen silent recently, likely because of aggressive counterintelligence efforts by the Kremlin, and also because of the chilling effect of Trump\u2019s push to expose the identity of an FBI informant involved in the Russia investigation.Officials don\u2019t think the CIA sources have been killed or thrown into prison; rather, they\u2019ve decided to slip under the radar and go quiet, apparently fearing that their identities will not be protected.The Times reported that intelligence officials believe \u201cthe outing of an F.B.I. informant under scrutiny by the House intelligence committee \u2014 an examination encouraged by President Trump \u2014 has had a chilling effect on intelligence collection.\u201dIn May, the FBI was forced to take the extraordinary step of putting in place emergency security measures to protect the safety of an informant and his associates after Trump and his GOP allies pushed to expose the informant\u2019s identity.http://www.americanindependent.com/us-intel-sources-in-russia-go-dark-after-trump-outs-fbi-informant/Original article linkhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/cia-russia-midterm-elections.html "}, "replies": [" The move was part of a broader effort by Trump and his cronies to undermine the Russia probe by making unreasonable demands for documents from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, then firing him when he failed to comply \u2014 thus laying the groundwork for ultimately firing special counsel Robert Mueller.At the time, intelligence officials pushed back hard on the Republican-led effort to obtain documents that could expose the informant, saying the move could endanger his life and discourage others from providing sensitive information to U.S. intelligence agencies. Turning over information that could expose a source\u2019s identity would \u201ccontradict years of policy about protecting intelligence sources,\u201d senior intelligence officials said in May.Those fears are coming true now, just as intelligence agencies and cybersecurity companies are sounding the alarm about renewed efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2018 midterms through hacking and influence operations.Informants in Russia provide critical information on such operations, but they\u2019ve stopped relaying information altogether lately, leaving U.S. intelligence agencies to make sense of the chaos without some of their best sources.As the Times reported, \u201cpeople inside or close to the Kremlin remain critical to divining whether there is a strategy behind seemingly scattershot efforts to undermine American institutions.\u201d\u201cSpies and informants overseas also give American intelligence agencies early warning about influence campaigns, interference operations or other attempts to compromise the United States. That information, in turn, can improve the ability of domestic agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I., to quickly identify and attempt to stop those efforts,\u201d the Times added.

Thanks to this new work, we now have evidence of the arrival of Sicilian amber in Iberia from at least the 4th Millennium BC.\u201d\u201cInterestingly, the first amber objects recovered in Sicily and identified as being made from the local amber there (known as simetite) also date from the 4th Millennium BC; however, there is no other evidence indicating direct contact between Sicily and Iberia at this time.\u201d\u201cInstead, what we do know about are the links between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. It is plausible that Sicilian amber reached Iberia through exchanges with North Africa. This amber appears at southern Iberian sites and its distribution is similar to that of ivory objects, suggesting that both materials reached the Iberian Peninsula following the same or similar channels.\u201dhttps://popular-archaeology.com/article/sicilian-amber-in-western-europe-pre-dates-arrival-of-baltic-amber-by-at-least-2000-years/ "}, "replies": [" Senior author Professor Marcos Martin\u00f3n-Torres, of the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge adds, \u201cIt is only from the Late Bronze Age that we see Baltic amber at a large number of Iberian sites and it is likely that it arrived via the Mediterranean, rather than through direct trade with Scandinavia.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s peculiar is that this amber appears as associated with iron, silver and ceramics pointing to Mediterranean connections. This suggests that amber from the North may have moved South across Central Europe before being shipped to the West by Mediterranean sailors, challenging previous suggestions of direct trade between Scandinavia and Iberia.\u201dMurillo-Barroso concludes, \u201cIn this study, we\u2019ve been able to overcome traditional challenges in attempts at assigning corroded amber to a geological source. These new analytical techniques can be used as a reference to identify Sicilian amber, even from highly deteriorated archaeological samples.\u201d\u201cThere are still unresolved issues to be investigated in the future\u2014namely, exploring the presence of amber in North African contexts from the same time period and further researching the networks involved in the introduction and spread of Baltic amber in Iberia and the extent to which metals or other Iberian commodities were provided in return.\u201d ", " Pretty neat.

New DNA study raises possibility", "comment": " What started out as a straightforward genetic study of Florida\u2019s invasive python population has turned up a surprising plot twist: a small number of crossbred Burmese and Indian pythons with the potential to become a kind of Everglades super snake.For the study, published Sunday in the journal Ecology and Evolution, U.S. Geological Survey researchers examined the tail tissue of 400 snakes captured in South Florida, from the Big Cypress Swamp to the Everglades. While the vast majority appeared to be closely related Burmese pythons \u2014 imagine a family reunion packed with first and second cousins \u2014 13 had genetic markers from Indian pythons, a different species that unlike the swamp-loving Burmese snake prefers high, dry ground.The number is clearly small, but it raises the risk that over time some Everglades snakes could become better suited to a more varied landscape. Scientists call it hybrid vigor.\u201cIf the Indian pythons have a wider range, perhaps these Everglades snakes now have that capability,\u201d said lead author and USGS geneticist Margaret Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting and quite surprising, but we don\u2019t know the extent it\u2019s in the population.\u201dBecause evolution seems to abhor certainty, there\u2019s also the possibility the opposite happens through another process, she said, euphemistically referred to as \u2018outbreeding depression.\u2019The Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System allows researchers and citizens to report the locations of spotted pythons. Red circles indicate the sightings have been confirmed.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article217109205.html "}, "replies": [" The study originally intended to look at the genetic make-up of South Florida snakes to better understand how they spread and how to help control them. Pythons started turning up in the 1980s, likely escapees from a South Dade breeding facility or released pets. By 2000, they were declared official residents in Everglades National Park and have since continued to expand north into the state\u2019s expansive water conservation areas and west into Big Cypress. In 2016, they were found breeding in the Keys for the first time.If snakes in different areas had different DNA, that might tell wildlife managers something about how they\u2019ve been able to reproduce and spread so quickly.\u201cWe were initially looking for the population structure to get some information to shed some light on the invasion dynamics, or the core areas where the population may be breeding and then sending off migrants,\u201d Hunter said.No surprise, they found low diversity among the snakes that likely are the descendants of the handful of freed snakes, called the founder effect. In small populations, a shrinking gene pool can signal a population headed toward extinction: There is a good Florida example of that. By the 1990s, the number of Florida panthers had dwindled so low that the animals started suffering from the effects of in-breeding, including heart murmurs, reproductive problems and oddly kinked tails. Texas cougars, very close cousins, were imported to add to the gene pool.But the python population is so large \u2014 researchers believe they number in the many thousands based on the steep drop in nearly all small mammals in their range \u2014 that low diversity is not impeding the snake\u2019s ability to adapt, Hunter said.\u201cSuch a large population allows them to rapidly adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cIf some animals die out because of climatic issues, there are other animals that may not die out.\u201dBut in 13, they found that Indian marker. ", " \u201cThat was unexpected,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI kept looking at the data to make sure what I was seeing was correct.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear where the species got crossed, she said. In their native ranges, Burmese and Indian pythons have remained mostly distinct either because of the prey they eat or barriers in habitat. But they could breed in the wild. Breeders also frequently cross species to produce more desirable colors and patterns for the pet trade. The snakes may also have hooked up in the Everglades, but Hunter said that seems less likely since the markers she detected, which are only passed down through female snakes, were historical.Because Hunter and her colleagues focused on genetics, it\u2019s not yet clear how climate will play into the snake\u2019s evolution. Scientists suspect that a warming planet will allow them to roam further north. An upcoming study looking at how the snake has adapted should shed some light, she said. In the meantime, the rapid expansion has provided researchers with a rare window into evolution dynamics.\u201cAll species do this,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cBut we\u2019re watching evolutionary progress right in front of us.\u201d ", " Snakes should be extinguished ", " >>282106No hurt snek ", " >>282106Are you treading on me?

First off, according to Merriam Webster collusion means \"secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose.\" Let's start with the \"secret agreement.\" The fact that we're discussing this means it's not secret. SECRET MEANS NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. And yet we do know about it since Trump Jr was so forthcoming about these facts. Explain that Dems.Now for the \"agreement or cooperation.\" We have indisputable proof that this meeting was about Russian adoptions and only Russian adoptions. Sure the Dems have fabricated some evidence like emails, but personally I value the word of Trump more than anything I see. Now if there was agreement or cooperation at this meeting, wouldn't we have opened negotiations with the Russians about the adoptions. Of course, but Trump has only agreed with Putin on the subject of blaming American intelligence for creating this whole Russian conspiracy witch hunt (and he's right). Strike two for collusion.And now the kicker; the illegal or deceitful purpose. The one is easy; there is no law against talking about adoptions and it's not deceitful to do so. Even if you for some idiotic reason believe that something other than emails were discussed at the meeting, there is no evidence of deceit. Remember when Trump said during his campaign that he's been greedy all his life, but now is going to be greedy for us? This is an example of just that. Trump never claimed to be working for anyone other than himself, so by accepting Russian help (which he didn't do since the meeting was about adoptions), he was just being true to his word.

On Sunday, an attorney representing Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer and self-described \u201cfixer,\u201d revealed that over recent months he had been speaking regularly with the White House counsel who helped entangle Nixon in such legal and political jeopardy that he was compelled to resign in 1974.\u201cI reached out to my old friend John Dean because of what he went through with Watergate, and I saw some parallels to what Michael Cohen is experiencing,\u201d Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis told Politico. \u201cI wanted to gain from John\u2019s wisdom.\u201dDavis continued, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to raise expectations that Mr. Cohen has anything like the level of deep involvement and detailed knowledge that John Dean had in the Nixon White House as a witness to Nixon\u2019s crimes, but I did see some similarities and wanted to learn from what John went through.\u201dAs White House counsel, Dean was involved in the initial effort to cover up Nixon\u2019s involvement in the Watergate burglary in 1972. But Dean later cooperated with prosecutors and, after being fired by Nixon, provided key testimony to the Senate in which he directly implicated Nixon in the cover-up. In exchange for his cooperation, Dean served a short prison sentence after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice.Dean\u2019s role gave him a positive standing among many Americans. But the current president is not one of them. Trump slammed Dean on Sunday, following a New York Times report that the current president\u2019s White House counsel, Don McGahn, had spoken to Russia investigation special counsel Robert Mueller on multiple occasions, in part because he feared that the president could make him the fall guy in a possible obstruction of justice investigation.

Though it has received less attention than than the systematic torture of pigs and cows, perhaps no part of animal agriculture is more heinous than egg production, an industry in which hens are confined to excruciatingly small cages for the entirety of their tortured lives. As the Humane Society put it after an extensive investigation into the indescribable cruelties of this industry, \u201cPerhaps the most abused farm animals, nearly 280 million laying hens in the United States are confined in barren wire battery cages so restrictive the birds can\u2019t even spread their wings.\u201dAs consumers have awoken to the barbaric conditions of the egg industry, they have begun to turn toward incrementally more humane alternatives, such as cage-free eggs, as well as truly humane options, such as eggs from pasture-raised hens at places like Vital Farms.The market, as they say, is speaking. As Americans become more educated about the morally repellent practices of this industry, they are increasingly refusing to reward barbaric practices by buying eggs that are the byproduct of industrial torture. But in response, the powerful poultry industry \u2014 which long invoked principles of the \u201cfree market\u201d to justify their torture-derived products being available to consumers \u2014 have now reversed course. With consumers choosing more humane egg products, lobbyists for the poultry industry are pushing laws that would force stores to carry their products even if doing so offends their moral sensibilities and ethical judgments.https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/consumers-are-revolting-against-animal-cruelty-so-the-poultry-industry-is-lobbying-for-laws-to-force-stores-to-sell-their-eggs/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J25aTS8MFG0 "}, "replies": [" In Iowa, the nation\u2019s biggest egg-producing state, lawmakers, at the behest of the poultry lobby, are making their most brazen attempt yet to fight the tides of change: simply making it a legal requirement for grocery stores to carry inhumanely produced eggs. A new bill in the Iowa state legislature, overwhelmingly passed by the Iowa House of Representatives on Monday by a vote of 81-17, would force any Iowa grocery store that participates in the Women, Infants and Children federal food assistance program and sells what the bill refers to as \u201cspecialty eggs\u201d to also stock \u201cconventional eggs.\u201d \u201cSpecialty eggs\u201d are cage-free eggs, free-range eggs, or \u201cenriched colony cage\u201d eggs \u2014 eggs produced in larger cages with perches and other amenities in them. \u201cConventional eggs\u201d are eggs from hens confined in battery cages.The bill\u2019s supporters frame the measure as a consumer choice issue, arguing that the most economically destitute Iowans deserve access to lower priced eggs. Animal welfare advocates view the motivation differently.\u201cThese bills are designed to keep a dying industry afloat that consumers no longer want to support,\u201d said Cody Carlson, an attorney at Mercy for Animals. \u201cThis is an industry that refuses to change in any meaningful way.\u201d ", " In 2010, Carlson worked at two industrial egg farms in Iowa, covertly documenting the inhumane practices employed in egg production as an undercover investigator. He and his co-workers, he told The Intercept, would walk down vast rows of battery cages looking for mummified bird corpses stuck to the floors. The cages were about the size of a microwave, with seven to 10 hens crammed into each one. The floors were made of an abrasive wire mesh, so when birds died \u2014 often from thirst or starvation after their confinement had debilitated their muscles and bones, rendering them paralyzed \u2014 the live hens would stand on top of the decaying carcasses to give their feet some relief. Workers like Carlson were responsible for removing the trampled carcasses.\u201cWe called it \u2018pulling carpets,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cIt was common at the places I worked to find hens whose wings, legs, necks, and prolapsed ova became caught in the wires, condemning them to excruciating, prolonged deaths by dehydration or trampling by their cage-mates,\u201d Carlson told The Intercept in an email. The \u201cova\u201d that he refers to is the chicken equivalent of a uterus, which commonly prolapses because they are bred to produce so many eggs. \u201cWhen I pointed this out to my supervisor and offered to help untangle some of the hens, I was told this wasn\u2019t our job and should wait until they died to remove them,\u201d Carlson added.The cages Carlson worked among were stacked 12 feet high and extended for 200 yards. The hens were so tightly packed that each one had less floor space than the surface of an iPad upon which to spend her entire life. They couldn\u2019t spread their wings, and by the time they were a year old, \u201cthey are raw and featherless from rubbing up against each other and the cage wires,\u201d Carlson noted. He added: ", " >With nothing to do all day, the birds would naturally begin pecking each other out of boredom. Rather than alleviate their stress by giving them more space, the industry\u2019s response is to \u2018debeak\u2019 them, painfully severing the ends of their beaks (which are filled with nerve endings) with a hot iron. With this procedure, they still go mad from mental and physical deprivation, but lack the ability to act out.>Because male chickens don\u2019t lay eggs and aren\u2019t bred to grow as fast as broiler hens, they are useless to the industry. Typically, they are tossed into a machine that grinds them alive or are tossed into a large plastic bag where they are left to suffocate.The two facilities Carlson worked in were not marginal, fly-by-night operations; they were owned by two of the biggest egg producers in the country. The conditions he witnessed on a daily basis are typical of the industry.It would be a challenge to purposely design torture methods that would inflict more pain and suffering on hens than those used at the largest industrial egg factories in the U.S. This has been one of the most challenging issues of animal cruelty to arouse public concern, because chickens are commonly perceived to be less intelligent and less emotionally complex than dogs, pigs, or even cows, making it somehow more morally justified, or at least less personally painful, to inflict excruciating pain on them for life. Precisely for that reason, the standard practices at egg farms are among the most savage and torturous in the animal farm industry.One undercover video produced by Mercy for Animals revealed such shocking images that the company, Eggland\u2019s Best, announced it was \u201csetting a goal of working with our suppliers and customers to transition to 100 percent cage-free eggs by 2025,\u201d and claimed it \u201chas been at the forefront of egg industry best practices in a number of areas, including food safety, bird health, animal welfare, and 3rd party audit requirements.\u201d ", " Despite some recent, isolated reforms, severe abuses throughout the industry remain commonplace, even as a full ban on battery cages for egg-laying hens took effect in the European Union in 2012. The Humane Society reports that \u201cthe vast majority of egg-laying hens in the United States are confined in battery cages.\u201d\u201cThere is no more tortured farm animal than a hen in a cage,\u201d said Matthew O\u2019Hayer, the founder of Vital Farms, a producer of certified humane, pasture-raised eggs. \u201cIf you visit a caged operation, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll never eat another egg in your life.\u201dUNDERCOVER INVESTIGATORS LIKE Carlson have helped to bring this reality to consumers, creating a market for more humane alternatives and an appetite among voters for reform.In 2008, California voters approved the nation\u2019s first law specifically reforming conditions for hens in the egg industry. The ballot initiative, Proposition 2, passed in a landslide, and it prohibited the state\u2019s egg producers from confining hens in enclosures too small to allow them to turn around, stand up, lie down, and stretch their limbs. The initiative did the same for pregnant sows and veal calves.Before the measure went into effect in 2015, egg-laying hens in California were typically crammed into battery cages exactly like the ones Carlson worked with in Iowa. The new standards provided a modicum of relief to millions of California hens. ", " The expenses required to comply with the new regulations, however, put the state\u2019s egg farmers at a competitive disadvantage with out-of-state producers that sold their eggs in California stores. So the following year, to level the playing field, the California legislature adopted a new law that extended those standards to all eggs sold in the state, regardless of whether they were laid in a California facility or shipped from another state. Together, the ballot initiative and its successor bill constituted the codification of a new consumer awareness of the conditions that prevail in industrial egg production, and a new public willingness to compel producers to adopt more humane practices.Since Prop 2\u2019s passage, elected officials in Iowa and other egg-producing states have been vigorously fighting to undercut those laws in order to preserve access to California\u2019s massive consumer market for their own egg producers \u2014 without requiring them to invest in better conditions for their hens. In 2013, Iowa\u2019s Republican Rep. Steve King proposed an amendment to the federal Farm Bill that would have prevented any state from imposing standards on the production of agricultural goods created in another state \u2014 a measure explicitly aimed at nullifying the standards set by California\u2019s Prop 2. The amendment failed.In 2016, Iowa\u2019s governor, along with the attorneys general of five other states, sued California\u2019s then-State Attorney General Kamala Harris and the Humane Society, seeking to block enforcement of Prop 2. The suit was dismissed at the district court level and on appeal, and the Supreme Court declined to hear it. ", " These successes have spurred advocates for ending animal cruelty to propose legislation for even more humane conditions. California\u2019s legislators are now proposing to expand Prop 2\u2019s minimum cage size yet further, and activists are pushing a new California ballot initiative that would require the state\u2019s entire industry to go cage-free.As the egg industry failed in its effort to undermine the voters\u2019 will in California, the expanding national market for at least marginally more ethical eggs prompted 100 grocery store chains and dozens of chain restaurants and food manufacturers \u2014 Nestl\u00e9, McDonald\u2019s, and Walmart among them \u2014 to pledge to abandon caged eggs over the next decade. This is an important development because these outlets collectively comprise 70 percent of consumer demand in the United States.CAGED EGG PRODUCERS and their political allies, running short on options to stem the contraction of the market for caged eggs, are now resorting to extreme measures, including the outright abandonment of the free-market principles they once heralded as sacrosanct. In Iowa, the strategy of these corporations now rests on overriding the demands of the market and empowering the government to dictate to stores what they must sell \u2014 in particular, barring them from refusing to sell eggs that are the products of grotesque cruelty.It\u2019s an ironic position, because this kind of intervention in the private sector was exactly what politicians like King accused the state of California of doing with the passage of Prop 2. O\u2019Hayer, the Vital Farms founder, explained that when California voters adopted the animal rights measure, \u201cthe response was that we should let consumers make their own choices, and you can\u2019t boss them around.\u201d Now that consumers are choosing humane treatment of hens, that free-market principle has been kicked to the curb. ", " \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hypocritical that Iowa\u2019s factory farmers have pretended for a long time to care about protecting the free market,\u201d said Chris Holbein of the Humane Society, \u201cbecause now that the free market is turning against them and in favor of more responsible producers that are trying to do the right thing for consumers and animals, the factory producers want the government to force grocery stores to sell a product that is both unsafe and unethical.\u201dBecky Higgins, a small poultry farmer in Iowa, explained in the Des Moines Register that the bill just passed by the Iowa House will harm small farmers, the environment, consumer choice, consumer health, and humane treatment of animals \u2014 essentially, everyone except big industrial agriculture to which Iowa state legislators are subservient:Our state leaders are poised to consider legislation that would hurt Iowa family farmers like myself and consumers who support farming practices that are sustainable, humane and ethical. \u2026 These factory farms harm not only the animals, but also the environment and the viability of our rural communities. As a proud Iowa egg producer and small sustainable and traditional family farmer, I know firsthand just how harmful industrial animal agriculture has been to the Iowa way of life. ", " Now, disastrous bills are being discreetly and quickly moved through the Iowa Legislature. Sponsored by lawmakers beholden to corporate agribusiness interests, this legislation would force most grocery stores to sell eggs from hens cruelly confined in tiny, barren battery cages. A growing number of farmers like myself have dedicated their lives to raising the standard of care for our animals and employees, while producing safe, wholesome products. Like me, many of my fellow farmers across the state have converted to cage-free systems, and others opted to never use cages from the beginning. Cage-free production is more humane, better for the environment, and produces a safer, tastier, healthier egg. \u2026In addition to supporting the continued use of inhumane battery cages, these dangerous bills will also increase food safety risks for Iowa families. Extensive research has shown higher rates of the harmful bacteria salmonella in eggs from caged hens versus eggs from cage-free hens. The stressful living conditions and inability of caged hens to move lowers their immune systems, making the transfer of disease more likely. A major industry trade publication, Poultry World, wrote that \u201csalmonella thrives in cage housing.\u201d If the industry itself admits battery cage eggs are more dangerous, why on earth would they knowingly subject Iowa families to higher food safety risks?For as long as I can remember, industrial animal agriculture has been trying to stop any regulation of extreme cruelty by saying that the \u201cfree market should decide,\u201d yet now that the free market is rejecting the worst forms of factory farming practices, industrial agribusinesses is demanding that the government bail them out and take a share of the market away from more humane and responsible farmers.The government has no place mandating that grocers must sell a product that family farmers, businesses and consumers reject. ", " Neither the bill\u2019s legislative sponsors nor the Iowa Poultry Association responded to requests for comment.Animal rights activists have succeeded in making greater sectors of the public aware of, and repelled by, the extreme cruelty and barbarism of industrial farming corporations in the U.S. But these corporations still wield one last weapon, and it is a potent one: the ability to use their financial muscle and lobbying power to dictate laws, particularly in farming states. Their latest ploy demonstrates how desperate they have become \u2014 but also how powerful they remain. Consumers have their own power: their refusal to reward industrial farms and corporations for imposing gratuitous and incomprehensible suffering on living beings by purchasing their products. That is now one of the primary fronts animal rights activists view as a key to ensuring more humane treatment for animals in the U.S. and abroad.

The lawyer, who turned 40 last year, travels across Europe\u2019s luxury resorts, stays in five-star hotels, eats in the best restaurants, and hires concierge services to track down exclusive $17,000 Herm\u00e8s handbags for his wife.But Pavlov, an unassuming man of middling build and height with short brown hair, may be one of the most influential Russians you\u2019ve never heard of, with a set of unique connections across the elites of Russia and Eastern Europe\u2014not to mention London and Washington, D.C.\u2014which typify the elaborate networks of connections and influence that have come to attract huge media and government attention in the early years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.Pavlov has engaged some of the world\u2019s biggest law firms to act on behalf of him and his clients, has encouraged a former U.K. attorney general to lobby on his behalf, and has hired the consultancy firm part-owned by U.K. and Australian election maestro Lynton Crosby.Yet he\u2019s also embroiled in a huge international row over an alleged $230 million Russian fraud that left a lawyer tortured to death in a Russian prison; is closely tied to the Russian and Kazakh interior ministries; and is even alleged to have acted as a mediator between a Russian whistleblower and an alleged criminal gang, shortly before the whistleblower was found dead\u2014with U.S. intelligence pointing blame for the death directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin.Pavlov\u2019s jetset lifestyle embodies the elaborate network of connections between the Russian state and Western elites that special counsel Robert Mueller is now charged with investigating. Like most people in this world, Pavlov has always been a closed book\u2014until now. ", " >>278040The Daily Beast is able to shed unprecedented light on how Pavlov and those around him operate, thanks to a circumstance all too familiar to Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta, the Democratic National Committee, and others: The contents of Pavlov\u2019s emails were leaked and posted online following what he says was a hacking attack to an obscure site used by hackers to dump their finds. (The identity of Pavlov\u2019s hackers is not known, and Pavlov has not publicly speculated on it.)This rare cache of documents, plus court records from cases across the U.S. and detailed reporting, give a rare insight into the complex nexus of connections in which Pavlov resides\u2014a network that draws in interests connected to Putin and also business connections of President Trump.They also reveal the way Russia and its oligarchs and outriders work\u2014drawing together those in the Western establishment, its top businesses, and its numerous middlemen into the intrigues of the Russian state, its satellites, and its wealthy power players.>A trip to Cyprus In 2007, according to a complaint filed by U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Andrey Pavlov was on a trip to Cyprus. Rather than just a sunny mini-break, the prosecutors allege, Pavlov was meeting with a number of officials from the Russian Interior Ministry and a man called Dmitry Klyuev, whom he had known since 2001. Klyuev, the U.S. prosecutors allege, was the ringleader of a multimillion-dollar fraud concocted on that trip\u2014one that left a man dead in a Russian prison and which has sparked a years-long diplomatic row with an oddly central role in Trump\u2019s rise to power.It was this alleged fraud\u2014referred to as the Magnitsky case, after a lawyer who died pursuing it\u2014that prompted the meeting in Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to discuss \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton, a meeting Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen now claims the president knew about. ", " >>278041It was also the Magnitsky case that was directly raised by Putin in his summit with Trump in July, as a poor faith quid quo pro for allowing interviews with Russian intelligence officials over email hacking. The lobbying and work around the Magnitsky case\u2014in which Pavlov\u2019s emails show he was central\u2014have had world-shaking consequences.The row began with an alleged elaborate tax fraud that saw $230 million taken from the coffers of the Russian government through a bogus refund scheme, according to the prosecutors\u2019 complaint. Pavlov is accused by U.S. prosecutors of being a central player in that alleged fraud and its aftermath, and he has lobbied across the world against sanctions being imposed in response to it.The prosecutors alleged that a Russian criminal gang had managed to re-register companies belonging to a hedge fund based in the U.S. and U.K.\u2014Hermitage Capital\u2014to themselves, before orchestrating sham lawsuits that awarded massive damages against them. This meant the companies were then eligible for huge tax refunds, owing to their lawsuit-induced losses, which were then siphoned into numerous offshore accounts belonging to the conspirators.The U.S. prosecution document is laced with details that tie Pavlov to the alleged fraud from its very inception\u2014claims he has consistently denied.Russian Interior Ministry officials helped organize raids on Hermitage Capital in which materials, including the company\u2019s documents and official seals, were taken\u2014allowing, the prosecutors allege, for documents and contracts to be forged to enable the tax fraud.When the \u201csham\u201d lawsuits came to court, the U.S. contends, Pavlov was among the lawyers representing the \u201cstolen\u201d companies in cases they say \u201cwere orchestrated\u2026 for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining large money judgements,\u201d appearing in different cases to be purportedly acting both for and against the stolen companies. ", " >>278042The scheme worked, and the companies obtained around $230 million in fraudulent tax refunds\u2014at which point the Russian state swiftly moved against the companies\u2019 original owner, Hermitage Capital Management, which was left trying to defend itself against a fraud it claimed to be totally unaware of.To help it unpack what had happened, and defend itself, Hermitage engaged its own lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who quickly began filing criminal complaints against Klyuev and other alleged co-conspirators in the fraud.By October 2008, Magnitsky had publicly testified on multiple occasions against Klyuev and Russian Interior Ministry officials he alleged were behind the fraud\u2014only to see one such official, Lt. Col. Artem Kuznetsov, be placed in charge of the investigation.Magnitsky was arrested within a month. He was held in pre-trial detention for almost a year before being found dead in his cell in November 2009. A human rights report found he had been \u201cdenied necessary medical care in custody,\u201d had been \u201cbeaten by eight guards with rubber batons on the last day of his life,\u201d and when found on the brink of death in his cell, \u201cthe ambulance crew that was called to treat him as he was dying was deliberately kept outside of his cell for one hour and 18 minutes until he was dead.\u201dBill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, worked relentlessly to publicize the case as part of an international \u201cJustice for Magnitsky\u201d campaign, which garnered huge international press coverage before coming to the attention of lawmakers in the U.S. and the EU. There it quickly came to spell trouble for Pavlov and his associates, as the West contemplated instituting sanctions against the people alleged to bear responsibility for the fraud, and directly or indirectly for Magnitsky\u2019s death in a Russian jail. Separately, U.S. prosecutors began pursuing civil recovery of U.S. assets they believed may have been obtained as proceeds of the fraud. ", " >>278044It was here that the documents show Pavlov began to take action to attempt to protect his name against the allegations he and others faced\u2014and he wasn\u2019t short of influential Western firms to turn to for advice.>Sanctions and a Second DeathThere has been extensive coverage of the connections between Trump\u2019s businesses and Russian interests, but ties between Russia and Western political fixers, former government ministers, and big businesses are becoming business as usual\u2014as Pavlov\u2019s email cache detailing his lobbying efforts show.He began in October 2013 by contacting the Washington, D.C., law firm Akin Gump\u2014one of the world\u2019s biggest\u2014for assistance. The firm in turn suggested Pavlov could turn to FTI Consulting, a multinational \u201cbusiness advisory\u201d firm, to help tackle the New York prosecutor\u2019s report.After a meeting with Pavlov, FTI offered a proposal of $200,000 for an initial piece of work investigating the case.\u201cWe think we are in a very strong position to assist you in this matter,\u201d the proposal stated. \u201cThe primary goal of the investigation will be to rigorously scrutinize the claims made by those alleging a conspiracy. A secondary goal, which we would pursue to the extent possible, will be to develop an alternate narrative documenting what really happened.\u201dFTI then offered Pavlov two ways in which the work could be carried out\u2014depending how much control he wanted over what it looked into.\u201cSometimes, in cases like this one, clients ask us to conduct a fully independent investigation\u2026 the value proposition is you could present our work product as the result of an investigation that you did not direct,\u201d it stated. \u201cThe other approach would be more collaborative\u2026 we would seek your guidance on how to handle various issues.\u201d ", " >>278045In this instance, Pavlov appears not to have pursued FTI\u2019s offer of an investigation, whether independent or directed by him. Though the U.S. Congress did pass sanctions against a number of individuals alleged to have been involved in the fraud, Pavlov was not at the time considered for this list\u2014only to be added to it under significant political pressure in December 2017.In the EU, things were going less well, as the EU parliament was on the verge of signing a resolution stating the \u201cEU should deny visas to and freeze the EU assets of 32 Russian officials involved in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.\u201d Though this would have no legal force, it could serve to encourage action from EU governments or its counsel and would serve to implicate all those named in the resolution in connection with the fraud and its consequences.Pavlov turned this time to the law firm Debovoise & Plimpton to see what it could do, seeking out Lord Peter Goldsmith, the former U.K. attorney general who wrote the legal advice enabling Britain\u2019s involvement in the Iraq War, to \u201cadd value\u201d to his case on the international stage.Goldsmith acted for both Pavlov and another person named on the European parliament\u2019s list, Konstantin Ponomarev, to challenge the sanctions recommendation. Ponomarev urged Debevoise & Plimpton, where Goldsmith is a partner, to use the peer\u2019s name on a letter to be sent to EU officials of the pair\u2019s behalf.\u201cPls ask Lord Goldsmith to sign it,\u201d he wrote in an email also sent to Pavlov. \u201cHis signature on this letter adds value to my positions not only in the EU but also in the RF [Russian Federation].\u201dPonomarev was keen for this letter to be made public to put the receiving official \u201cin a stupid position if she does not respond.\u201d Goldsmith billed at \u00a3960 an hour for his work toward the case. ", " >>278046Pavlov also engaged a PR firm owned in part by Lynton Crosby, the election guru behind the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s 2015 and 2017 campaigns in the U.K., as well as Australian election campaigns, to act in the Magnitsky case\u2014though Crosby himself did not make representations in these cases.In the correspondence, Pavlov\u2019s lawyers describe Crosby\u2019s firm, CTF Partners, to him as \u201cthe lobbying firm.\u201d CTF is not registered as an outside lobbyist on either the U.K. or the EU registers of lobbyists. CTF said the project it undertook for Pavlov was a matter of background research and unrelated to lobbying.However, Pavlov\u2019s efforts proved futile: both he and Ponomarev were named on the final resolution, which passed the EU\u2019s parliament in 2014.This was the backdrop of the meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016\u2014in the midst of the presidential campaign\u2014between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-connected lawyer Veselnitskaya, who was involved in lobbying against Magnitsky-related sanctions, during which she apparently offered \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton.Unlike Pavlov, there are no allegations Veselnitskaya was involved in the original fraud behind the Magnitsky case, but she has worked as a campaigner against the ensuing sanctions since and is a known associate of Pavlov. The two were photographed together attending a screening of a film against the Magnitsky sanctions in the EU parliament and are Facebook friends.U.S. prosecutors are also eager to explore the level of connection between Veselnitskaya and Pavlov, having served the latter with a subpoena for his correspondence with her and others when he made a short trip to the U.S. in 2016, a time before he was affected by U.S. sanctions.There is one more twist in Pavlov\u2019s alleged role in the Magnitsky saga: a U.K. coroner\u2019s court has heard allegations he was involved in a second death connected to it, a charge he has resolutely denied. ", " >>278048In November 2012, Alexander Perepilichnyy\u2014a one-time alleged conspirator in the case, who had turned whistleblower and was living in exile in Britain\u2014died while jogging, in a case initially judged to be a natural death.Authorities have been accused of missing numerous pieces of evidence around Perepilichnyy\u2019s death, which is on a list of possible Russian assassinations on U.K. soil kept by U.S. intelligence officials, which was uncovered by BuzzFeed News.Pavlov met Perepilichnyy in the months before the latter\u2019s death. Perepilichnyy reportedly referred to Pavlov as a Russian Interior Ministry official with whom he was seeking rapprochement. In the inquest into Perepilichnyy\u2019s death\u2014which is still ongoing nearly six years later\u2014the court heard Pavlov was in the country at the time of the whistleblower\u2019s demise, left the day after, and was \u201ccertainly in any view a candidate for the killing of Mr Perepilichnyy,\u201d according to a lawyer working for the firm providing Perepilichinyy\u2019s life insurance.\u201dPavlov has firmly denied the allegation, telling The Atlantic he had only been in England for a matter of hours, and had only learned of Perepilichnyy\u2019s death days after. The inquest has yet to rule.The Magnitsky case is not the only international controversy in which Pavlov has a hand, though\u2014nor the only one with connections to those in Trump\u2019s orbit. And while Perepilichnyy may have overstated things if he suggested Pavlov worked for the Russian Interior Ministry, Pavlov\u2019s emails reveal a very close working relationship with it\u2014as the case of the row between a billionaire in exile, the Kazakh government, and a female lawyer caught in the middle of it shows. ", " >>278049>\u2018You All Understand This Looks Bad and Illegal\u2019In April 2014, Olena Tyshchenko\u2014a Ukranian lawyer, mother of four, and key witness in the U.K.\u2019s biggest ever fraud case\u2014emailed a senior partner at the London office of one of the world\u2019s largest law firms, Hogan Lovells.Her email detailed a string of allegations against the firm and one of its clients, a preeminent Kazakh bank. Her accusations were grave: that she had been arrested in Russia on false pretenses, visited in isolation cells by lawyers acting against her to give \u201cfalse evidence,\u201d kept in illegal custody, and forcefully taken to Kazakhstan.\u201cI was released only after I signed the agreement [to cooperate as a witness] written by Hogan Lovells,\u201d she wrote in the furious email. \u201cThis you all understand looks bad and illegal.\u201dThe email, and all of the serious allegations of witness intimidation and contamination, arrived soon afterward after being forwarded through a middleman into the inbox of Pavlov, one of the people present in the cell\u2014according to a transcript produced by Kazakh authorities and emailed to Pavlov\u2014where Tyshchenko claims she was interrogated, without a lawyer, under armed guard.The case in question was that of Mukhtar Ablyazov, a Kazakh banker and political rival of the country\u2019s president. Ablyazov was accused of a multibillion-pound fraud against BTA Bank (in which he was once the largest shareholder, but which was subsequently nationalized) but had protested that his prosecution was politically motivated. After the bank was nationalized in 2009, Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan and later received political asylum in the U.K. Multiple human-rights groups had spoken out against his attempted extradition. ", " >>278050Ablyazov\u2019s legal case, aspects of which are still ongoing, has involved dozens of hearings in U.K. and French courts, and is one of the largest and most lucrative ever seen in Western Europe, with the Financial Times reporting that more than 50 solicitors and 32 barristers\u2014including eight queen\u2019s counsels or prominent lawyers\u2014have worked on the case since 2012.BTA alleges Ablyazov misappropriated up to $6 billion in bank funds and assets, and the bank has spent over five years pursuing him in the U.K. courts through numerous sets of high-stakes proceedings.Ablyazov was granted political asylum in the U.K. but fled the country in 2012 to France after being held in of contempt of court related to seizure of funds and disclosing information relating to the case. Civil proceedings relating to seizing his assets continued in his absence.One such High Court hearing, in July 2013, was attended by Olena Tyshchenko, a confidante and legal adviser to Ablyazov. As she left the U.K. court, she was photographed by private investigators working for Diligence, a security firm founded by former MI5 and CIA staff, hired by Hogan Lovells\u2014photos that were then passed to and published by the U.K. press.The investigators managed to follow Tyshchenko across London and into France, as she visited Ablyazov in his \u201chideaway\u201d\u2014a villa near Cannes. He was arrested by French authorities in connection to his alleged bank fraud in an armed raid soon afterward, and the story of how he was tracked down\u2014along with some of the surveillance photos\u2014leaked to the press.Ablyazov, though, was not the only one to be arrested. Tyshchenko herself was arrested by Russian authorities and kept in custody for four months, until she agreed to be a cooperative witness for BTA as well as for Russian and Kazakh authorities. ", " >>278052The emails of Pavlov shed light on months of correspondence between Kazakh authorities, Pavlov, and one of the world\u2019s most respected law firms\u2014from which Trump later hired his own lawyer Ty Cobb, who was not directly involved in this case.The cache shows the peril faced by people, like Tyshchenko, who get caught in the wheels in battles between oligarchs and autocrats, even when they are ostensibly being fought through Western courts. Documents in the email cache show Pavlov was present during an extended interrogation of an obviously traumatized Tyshchenko by both Russian and Kazakh Interior Ministry officials in prison in Moscow during November 2013.>Tyshchenko in PrisonA transcript of the interrogation was sent to Pavlov by the Kazakhstan prosecutor\u2019s office and has been professionally translated and reviewed by The Daily Beast.The documents confirm the close involvement of Kazakh authorities in Ablyazov\u2019s case\u2014which Amnesty International has repeatedly warned would suggest political motivation for the extradition request.Early in the transcript, the Kazakh prosecutor explains to Tyshchenko he will not interview her with her lawyer present. \u201cThe lawyers will be [here] shortly, you will consult with them whether you wish to or not,\u201d he says. \u201cI will explain why I will not be interrogating you in their presence.\u201d ", " >>278053Soon afterward, he tells Tyshchenko, \u201cThey [Kazakhstan] don\u2019t want there to be any kinds of false rumours about your being pressured or any kind of illegal activities.\u201dShe interrupts: \u201cWhen there are three armed men with me and I\u2019m handcuffed?\u201dHe responds: \u201cThis is only common procedure which is not dictated by us, it\u2019s dictated by the law. Because we have you here and you consider yourself a law-abiding citizen. But there are some people who do not share this opinion. Sometimes they will attempt to escape.\u201dDuring the lengthy exchanges, Tyshchenko speaks of her anguish at her situation, especially at being separated from her children, with little opportunity to speak to them.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a dead body in the isolation cell, don\u2019t you understand? I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she tells her captors.Soon afterward, in December 2013, Tyshchenko agreed to sign an agreement drafted by Hogan Lovells to cooperate with BTA Bank in its actions against Ablyazov, including turning over evidence in the U.K. and France, and ceasing all association with Ablyazov, documentation in the email cache shows.The agreement included a promise to \u201cwaive any entitlement to claim legal professional privilege.\u201d In exchange, Tyshchenko herself would be freed from the threat of prosecution.The final deal, signed by Tyshchenko, was sent by Pavlov to Hogan Lovells on Dec. 20. It was accompanied by a handwritten note from Tyshchenko to Hogan Lovells partner Chris Hardman.\u201cI fully understand the meaning of the said agreement and its statements and consequences of its signing,\u201d she states, also confirming she had enough time to \u201creceive relevant professional advice\u201d before signing.Within days of its signing, Hardman was flying to Moscow to meet with Tyshchenko, discussing the meeting with Pavlov and inviting him to sit in. \u201cIf not, do you have any thoughts on how to get the best out of her?\u201d he asks. ", " >>278054Hardman\u2019s professional profile at Hogan Lovells prominently advertises his role in the BTA case.\u201cHis work on the BTA Bank matter, for instance, has been universally lauded and has been described as \u2018extraordinary litigation on a large scale\u2019 and \u2018the most ground-breaking recent case by common consensus,\u2019\u201d it states.Tyshchenko\u2019s cooperation with authorities secured her release from detention and resulted in a large handover of documents and evidence to BTA, its lawyers, and Russian and Kazakh authorities.>Agreement Annulledall was not well. Pavlov received an email from Pavel Prosyankin, a senior BTA executive, using the alias \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d of action points from a coordination meeting between BTA, Russian, and Kazakh authorities, including recommending coordinating responses between \u201cstate security agencies.\u201dOne point on the list was \u201cAnnulling O. Yu. Tyshchenko\u2019s amnesty and working with her moving forwards.\u201d Her deal had provided \u201ca great deal of evidence\u201d and \u201claid the foundations for questioning new persons of interest,\u201d they stated, but they complained she \u201cis currently avoiding travel to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.\u201d As a result, the document states, the Russian Federation\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office had annulled her agreement.This provoked Tyshchenko\u2019s furious and panicked emails to Michael Roberts, another Hogan Lovells partner working on the BTA case, about the circumstances of her cooperation.Speaking about the canceled amnesty, Tyshchenko stated, \u201cI am preparing the statement to withdraw all my evidence as given under duress.\u201dShe made a bulleted list of allegations against Prosyankin, Pavlov, and Hardman. ", " >>278057\u201cYou should understand that\u201c- the fact that I was arrested on the basis of false evidence given by Messrs Prosiankin and Pavlov as well as statement of Mr Hardman, who mentioned in his statement he was saying what the Client had told him but nevertheless he then told me it depended on him whom to arrest, which means he is seriously involved in illegal influence on the investigators;\u201c- numerous visits of Mr Pavlov and Mr Prosiankin to the isolator where I was kept and pressure they applied on me to give evidence including false evidence \u2026\u201c- that I was released only after I signed the agreement written by Hogan Lovels; [sic]\u201c- that when I was released I was forcefully taken to Kazakhstan by KNB [Kazakhstan\u2019s intelligence agency];\u201cand numerous other breaches of law - together constitute serious crime and corruption under the Russian law and not only.\u201dTyshchenko further noted that some of the Russian lawyers and investigators involved in the case\u2014including Pavlov\u2014were accused of involvement in the Magnitsky case.\u201cTwo out of three investigators in the group are from Magnitsky list and you, being American company, are cooperating with them till now,\u201d she stated. \u201cThis all as you understand [sic] looks bad and illegal.\u201dA few days later Tyshchenko sent a calmer email, repeating the allegations that she had received threats from a BTA staffer and that BTA was involved in reopening the criminal case against her in Russia, but pledged to \u201cassist as agreed\u201d if her case could be \u201cclosed once and for all.\u201dBoth emails were forwarded by Prosyankin\u2014using his \u201cPeter Pan\u201d alias\u2014to Pavlov within days of being received by Hogan Lovells. ", " >>278058The Daily Beast sent Hogan Lovells a detailed series of inquiries based on the extensive email correspondence. A spokeswoman for the firm said it would \u201cnot be appropriate\u201d for it to respond in detail but sent a statement from Hardman, the partner in the firm who worked on the case.\u201cHogan Lovells, of course, denies any involvement in witness intimidation,\u201d he said. Its role in the investigation into Tyshchenko in Russia, he claimed, was limited to one of its partners giving evidence to the authorities about Tyshchenko\u2019s involvement with Ablyazov, when requested to do so.\u201cMrs. Tyshchenko\u2019s allegations in this regard were withdrawn shortly after they were made and she cooperated with BTA Bank in its efforts to recover its losses caused by the frauds perpetrated by Mr. Ablyazov and his associates.\u201dTyshchenko, who was later appointed as an anti-corruption investigator for the Ukrainian government, still insists her detention was politically motivated.>Six Degrees of TrumpIt is not illegal, nor even necessarily immoral, for any Western citizen or business to have dealings with Russia or its satellites\u2014as billions of dollars of Russian investment into London property and American lawyers signals, it\u2019s become a key component in Western economies.But as Pavlov\u2019s email cache highlights, nor is it simple. Working out where businesses, alleged criminals, governments, and state agencies end and begin is all but impossible, and often comes with considerable moral ambiguity\u2014especially as so many Russian stories, from alleged assassinations, to frauds, to business deals, to lobbying, intertwine and interconnect.These interconnections have now taken center stage in American politics, thanks to the U.S. president\u2019s years-long dealings with Russia: Trump and his family have their own connections with almost every entity involved in this story. ", " >>278060Trump hired his former lawyer Cobb from Hogan Lovells. Trump contemplated a hotel project in Georgia with ties to Ablyazov and BTA Bank. Trump associates contemplated a Trump Tower in Astana, Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, after Ablyazov\u2019s fall. Trump Jr. met with Veselnitskaya, Pavlov\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d in Trump Tower to discuss the Magnitsky sanctions during the 2016 election campaign.In the strange whorl of the Russian orbit, where everything is connected, Trump and his team pop up at each point. Perhaps most infamously of all, as Mueller detailed in an indictment published just days before Trump met Putin, Russian intelligence interfered to hack the emails of Clinton associates and published online by WikiLeaks, an act that came to dominate U.S. election coverage for weeks\u2014in a bid to help Trump win the 2016 election.And yet on the flip side, Pavlov found himself in the same position as those in the DNC. Unknown hackers targeted his emails, which were for a time available online (The Daily Beast was passed a link to them by another journalist), before being removed from the torrent site upon which they were shared.When asked about the publication of his emails and his comment on their contents, Pavlov responded by email. The cache posted online was, he wrote, \u201chacked and stolen emails\u201d and the information within was privileged, adding, \u201cyour findings are factually wrong and highly defamatory,\u201d though he did not provide any specific details.

The City of Philadelphia thereafter chose not to comply with a detainer lodged by ICE for the defendant, who was instead released from custody by the Philadelphia Department of Prisons.

I don't doubt that. But they should stand on their own merits, society-wide outcomes, not anecdotal evidence..Even so, if the objective is to minimize incidence of crime, then possibly the worst way to do that is do discourage a community from interacting with law enforcement.

Chris Collins charged with securities fraud", "comment": " Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), the first member of Congress to back President Donald Trump before the 2016 election, was indicted Wednesday by federal prosecutors and charged with fraud in connection to an alleged insider-trading scheme linked to his investments in an Australian biotech firm.The third-term congressman, who represents a district in western New York, had been under scrutiny from the Office of Congressional Ethics for his connection to the company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. He was the company's largest shareholder and served on its board.Prosecutors say that in 2017, Collins passed inside information to his son, Cameron, who passed it to another alleged conspirator, Stephen Zarsky, father of Cameron Collins' fiancee. The three \u2014 all of whom pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI \u2014 and other family and friends avoided about $768,000 in losses as a result of the inside information, prosecutors allege.\"Congressman Collins, who by virtue of his office helps to write the laws of our nation, acted as if the law didn't apply to him,\" said Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announcing the charges.Collins' attorneys rejected the allegations.\"We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name,\" said Collins' lawyers, Jonathan Barr and Jonathan New of BakerHostetler. \"It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics stock. We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated. Congressman Collins will have more to say on this issue later today.\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/08/gop-rep-collins-indicted-charged-with-securities-fraud-766744 "}, "replies": [" Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said Collins would be arraigned Wednesday afternoon in New York.Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its own insider-trading charges against Collins, his son and Zarsky.\u201cIn the hours and days after learning of the drug trial results, Christopher Collins, his son, and their associates exchanged a flurry of calls,\u201d said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division. \u201cThe investigation yielded a detailed footprint left by the defendants, revealing their frantic efforts to sell shares and warn others before Innate announced bad news.\"The SEC also said it settled additional charges against Lauren Zarsky \u2014 the girlfriend of Collins' son, the SEC said, though the indictment says they later became engaged \u2014 and her mother, Dorothy Zarsky, for insider trading. The pair did not admit or deny wrongdoing but agreed to give up \"ill-gotten gains\" and pay fines, the SEC said.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Collins would not serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee \"until this matter is settled,\" saying that \"insider trading is a clear violation of the public trust.\"According to the indictment, the alleged conspiracy began on June 22, 2017, while Collins was attending the White House's congressional picnic. He received an email from Innate's CEO alerting him that the company's highly touted drug had failed in clinical trials. He replied, \"Wow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???\" ", " Prosecutors say Collins then alerted his son, Cameron, on the results of the trials, but didn't trade shares himself. The congressman was already under investigation at the time for his relationship with Innate by the Office of Congressional Ethics. Though Collins couldn't trade his own stock, prosecutors say he tipped off his son to help him avoid losses. His son, in turn, told other associates, who sold stock in Innate as well. The drug test results were made public on June 26, 2017.Prosecutors allege that an aide to Collins' congressional office issued a statement to a local reporter \"in a manner designed to mislead the public\" about when Collins' son had sold his shares.Collins told POLITICO in December that there was \"nothing\" to the allegations he had traded insider information, which had surfaced publicly amid the congressional ethics inquiry.\"I hate that I lost every penny that I invested, but as a general rule, if I\u2019m trading on insider information, no one could do worse than me \u2014 who lost every penny, and I still own every share,\" said Collins, who saw the value of his stake plunge as much as $17 million as of June 2017.Previous scrutiny of Collins' relationship with Innate Immunotherapeutics also highlighted his efforts to persuade colleagues and associates to invest in the company. Among his former colleagues who had invested: former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who made $225,000 on his investment, according to public records. Collins told congressional ethics investigators that he likely discussed the company with Price on the House floor, who was in the House until he joined Trump's Cabinet in April 2017.\"[W]hen we\u2019re sitting on the House floor, killing time during a motion to recommit, we talk about our kids, and we talk about our vacations and we talk about \u2026 the New York Yankees, in my case, my companies,\" Collins said. ", " Nick Peters, a spokesman for Price, said he \"addressed his ownership of Innate Immunotherapeutics stock during his confirmation hearings for HHS secretary and sold any stock he held in February 2017.\u201dAnother GOP lawmaker, Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn, purchased Innate stock for $15,000 to $50,000 and recently sold it for less than $1,000. Lamborn said he \"took a big bath\" on the stock but was not angry at Collins. He said there was media focus on the company, and he was \"intrigued by the possibility there was something for multiple sclerosis,\" the company's main clinical focus.\"[Collins] wasn't pushing it,\" Lamborn told POLITICO in an interview earlier this summer before Collins' indictment. \"It was in the media, first of all. If asked about it, he would respond to questions. He wasn't being pushy. And I figure I'm a big boy and I can make my own decisions. Even if they're wrong decisions.\"Other lawmakers who Collins recruited to buy stock in the company: Reps. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), Billy Long (R-Mo.) and Mike Conaway (R-Texas). Collins also told OCE that some members of his staff were among the investors.Berman, the U.S. attorney, would not say whether other members of Congress were under investigation, saying only that it was \"not an aspect of this indictment.\"Conaway's office said he invested in Innate Immunotherapeutics because of its efforts to develop a treatment for multiple sclerosis, \"which impacts a close friend of his.\" He sold his shares, according to a spokeswoman, in November 2017 at a \"considerable loss.\"Collins often heatedly rejected any charges of insider trading, and he took particular umbrage at the drive by one Democratic New York colleague, Rep. Louise Slaughter, to delve deeper into his business dealings. Slaughter, who died in March, had prodded the SEC and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, along with congressional investigators, to pursue allegations of insider trading by Collins. ", " \u201cAnyone who has the privilege to be a member of Congress has a responsibility to uphold the public trust and meet the highest ethical standard,\" she said in a statement in October. \"He put his obsession to enrich himself before the people he swore to represent. It is a disgrace to Congress and to his constituents, who deserve better.\u201dCollins rebuked Slaughter at the time, calling her a \"despicable human being\" as a result of her push.The indictment comes just three months before the November midterm elections, but Berman said the timing wasn\u2019t political.\u201cPolitics does not enter into our decision making on charging a case,\u201d Berman said. \u201cWe bring a case when the case is ready to be brought.\u201dStill, Democrats in New York jumped at the news Wednesday. The 27th District is the most Republican in the Empire State and had been considered a reach even as the blue state prepares for a blue wave.But Gov. Andrew Cuomo had been targeting Collins for months, angry that he pushed a Medicaid funding tweak \u2014 shifting billions in local costs to the state\u2019s budget \u2014 in House legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Cuomo had even pushed his lieutenant, former Rep. Kathy Hochul, to leave the ticket and run against Collins.Cuomo and Hochul are facing a Democratic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon and New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams. According to his allies, Cuomo sought to drop Hochul from the ticket to increase its racial diversity, but she demurred, recognizing the up-hill nature of a run against Collins, who defeated her in 2012.Democrats culled a larger field and settled on Grand Island supervisor Nate McMurray to challenge Collins. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, a Democrat who defeated Collins in the lawmaker's bid for a third term in that office in 2011, said the indictment changed the calculation.

That means the town, which also covers some health benefits, is unlikely to have to pay the added benefits for more than a decade.Despite the city\u2019s surplus, the mayor said Central Falls is unlikely to restore the pensions.What happened in Central Falls is \u201ccertainly not going to be a one-off,\u201d said Robert Flanders, who acted as the city\u2019s state-appointed receiver. \u201cBecause other cities and towns, not just in Rhode Island but across the country, are still in bad shape.\u201d ", " >>275032>Raise spending until they have to raise taxesC'mon, tat's moronic, nobody wants to raise taxes for no reason.

The official said the talks also would cover nuclear proliferation, North Korea, Iran and Syria.Moscow signaled openness to another meeting between the two leaders, as Trump continued to face criticism over his first meeting with his Russian counterpart in Helsinki, where he seemed to accept Putin\u2019s denials of meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 despite findings by US intelligence services.

But not the tree shrew, according to a study publishing July 12 in the open-access journal PLOS Biology by Yalan Han of the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, and colleagues. The researchers found that this close relative of primates is unaffected by the active ingredient in chili peppers due to a subtle mutation in the receptor that detects it. They speculate that this is an evolutionary adaptation to enable tree shrews to cope with a peppery plant that makes up part of their diet.Capsaicinoids, including the capsaicin found in chili peppers, are chemicals that deter animals from eating them. They act by triggering the activation of TRPV1, an ion channel found on the surface of pain-sensitive cells in the tongue and elsewhere. TRPV1's normal job is to alert animal to the presence of harmful heat, which is why capsaicinoids induce a sharp burning sensation. While humans may develop a tolerance and even a liking for capsaicinoids, most animals avoid feeding on plants that contain them.The authors observed that Chinese tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) actively fed on chili peppers, and, in contrast with mice, did not reduce their food intake as the concentration of capsaicin increased. They found that while the levels of TRPV1 in mice and tree shrews were similar, and both mammals were similarly responsive to other painful stimuli, the TRPV1 ion channel in the tree shrew was much less responsive to capsaicin. The authors then revealed the reason for this; TRPV1 proteins of mice and tree shrews differed by a single amino acid in the binding pocket for capsaicin, a mutation that the researchers found reduced the binding ability, and thus pain-inducing potential, of capsaicin in the tree shrew's form of the protein.Read more at: https://phys.org/news/2018-07-tree-shrews-tolerate-hot-peppers.html#jCp "}, "replies": [" While chili peppers themselves do not grow in the tree shrew's environment, a plant that produces abundant capsaicinoids, Piper boehmeriaefolium, does, and is an important food source for the tree shrew. The ability to feed on this plant while most other species avoid it, the authors suggest, was potentially an important driver for the spread of the TRPV1 mutation through the tree shrew population over time.\"We propose that this mutation is an evolutionary adaptation that enabled the tree shrew to acquire tolerance for capsaicinoids, thus widening the range of its diet for better survival,\" Han says.

It exposed the fragility of discussions at the center of Trump\u2019s foreign policy and raised questions about Pyongyang\u2019s intentions.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/north-korean-negotiator-teases-and-flatters-as-pompeo-enters-second-day-of-talks/2018/07/07/d2a06324-8175-4589-bf08-def6e56aa962_story.html?utm_term=.be569c8e2030 "}, "replies": [" At the very least, the statement was an embarrassment for Pompeo, who has repeatedly said Kim has assured him personally that North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear weapons. But Pompeo did not meet with the North Korean leader on this trip, as he did on two previous visits and as some administration officials had hoped he would this time as well.In its return to pre-Singapore bellicose rhetoric, the ministry\u2019s statement also served as a rebuttal to Trump, who has declared the North Korean nuclear threat over and done with, even though nothing in the joint declaration signed in Singapore was definitive. The two countries do not even agree on what the concept of denuclearization means.Some analysts saw no reason for alarm in Pyongyang\u2019s downbeat version of events, considering it a routine North Korean negotiating tactic rather than a full-blown retreat from Pyongyang\u2019s seeming commitments.\u201cThey\u2019re upping the ante for what they want, and downplaying what we want,\u201d said Bill Richardson, who has negotiated with North Korea for prisoner releases. \u201cThis is typical. They\u2019re very skilled at sending messages. And their message is that this negotiation is not going to be easy. And it\u2019s going to be very costly. So you\u2019d better be prepared to deliver.\u201dBut Evans Revere, a former U.S. diplomat with a long history of negotiating with North Korea, said it was evident that the talks in Pyongyang had not gone well \u2014 and that it appears North Korea may have no intention of actually denuclearizing in the way the United States would want.\u201cPompeo appears to have presented the North Koreans with some demands and requirements for real moves toward denuclearization, as opposed to the symbolic steps and empty language Pyongyang has been using so far. He deserves credit for doing so,\u201d Revere wrote in an email. ", " \u201cBut in doing so, he has elicited North Korean ire, and he has now seen the reality of North Korea\u2019s game plan and intentions that many of us have been describing for some time,\u201d Revere added. \u201cWelcome to our world, Mr. Secretary.\u201dPompeo has come under increasing pressure to produce results, with Trump having touted the summit as a game-changing moment that eliminated North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat. The State Department announced the formation of a small working group to work on details. Richardson counseled patience, endurance and restraint.\u201cThe president needs to restrain himself from declaring \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 when the mission hasn\u2019t really started,\u201d he said.Pompeo went to Pyongyang hoping to formalize details of what actions North Korea is committed to taking to show its intention to denuclearize. Pyongyang has said it expects sanctions to be lifted in stages as it takes steps toward that goal, though Washington has insisted there will be no sanctions relief until the process has been completed. But the \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d the administration adopted to squeeze the North Korean economy through sanctions has eased somewhat already, particularly along the border with China.Expectations were buoyed in part by national security adviser John Bolton, who said last week that North Korea could accomplish the \u201cbulk\u201d of its denuclearization within a year. Pompeo has been more circumspect, estimating that it will take until the end of Trump\u2019s first term in office, or two and a half years.\u201cThe expectation that Pompeo was going to come home with a dramatic deliverable was unrealistic to start,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. ", " Washingtoncompost is not a valid source. It's an extreme left opinion piece. ", " \u201cYeah, technically, it could be done in a year if North Korea didn\u2019t have its own ideas about the pace and what the United States needs to do to get there. What we\u2019re seeing is the reality of negotiations. It\u2019s not surprising to see the North Koreans push back in reminding the United States it has some steps to take in order to help build a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dAnalysts say that any final accord between the two nations to eliminate Pyongyang\u2019s sophisticated nuclear and missile arsenal will be a long slog with no guarantee of success.\u201cWhile we were hopeful there would be some sort of breakthrough, it seems both sides can\u2019t even agree to what transpired after countless hours of talks \u2014 and that is a massive problem,\u201d said Harry Kazianis, an Asia expert at the Center for the National Interest.Pompeo told reporters Saturday that the two countries would soon hold working-level talks on the destruction of Pyongyang\u2019s testing facility for missile engines. He also said Pentagon officials will meet with their North Korean counterparts on or around July 12 at the demilitarized zone between the Koreas to discuss the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel who died during the Korean War.Last month, Trump told a crowd of supporters that the remains of 200 service members had \u201cbeen sent back,\u201d but U.S. military officials later said that was not the case. U.S. officials viewed the handing over of remains as an easy confidence-building measure for North Korea to demonstrate its sincerity, and they have been frustrated with the slowness of Pyongyang\u2019s follow-through.Ahead of the new round of talks, Kim Yong Chol, North Korea\u2019s septuagenarian former spy chief, teased Pompeo, suggesting that the \u201cserious\u201d negotiations the night before may have caused Pompeo to lose sleep.\u201cWe did have very serious discussion on very important matters yesterday. So thinking about those discussions, you might have not slept well last night,\u201d Kim Yong Chol said. ", " \u201cDirector Kim, I slept just fine,\u201d Pompeo responded, according to a pool report provided by reporters accompanying the secretary of state.Kim Yong Chol, a regime hard-liner who is careful not to act outside Kim Jong Un\u2019s instructions, said he needed to \u201cclarify\u201d aspects of his nearly three-hour negotiations Friday with Pompeo, a desire the top U.S. diplomat immediately echoed.\u201cThere are things that I have to clarify as well,\u201d Pompeo said.The display of small talk between North Korean and U.S. officials, a rarity given the infrequent contacts between the longtime adversaries, revealed both the tension at the heart of the nuclear negotiations and the increasing familiarity of the two men, who have become diplomatic counterparts during Pompeo\u2019s three visits to Pyongyang and Kim Yong Chol\u2019s visit to the United States in May.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pompeo had been \u201cvery firm\u201d in seeking three basic goals from the visit: the complete denuclearization of North Korea, security assurances and the repatriation of fallen soldiers\u2019 remains.Diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations, said the United States continues to struggle to develop a shared understanding of what denuclearization means to North Korea. Maintaining even basic communications has been difficult.Adding to the pressure on Pompeo is a leaked U.S. intelligence assessment casting doubt on North Korea\u2019s willingness to relinquish its arsenal.Nauert said Pompeo called Trump on Saturday morning to update him on the talks, a conversation that included Bolton and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly.Analysts say there are likely to be many more calls like this in the months and probably years to come.\u201cThe North Korea threat still exists,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cNorth Korea continues to improve its arsenal.

Jim Jordan, the powerful Republican congressman from Ohio, is being accused by former wrestlers he coached more than two decades ago at Ohio State University of failing to stop the team doctor from molesting them and other students.The university announced in April that it was investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, abused team members when he was the team doctor from the mid-1970s to late 1990s.Jordan, who was assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994, has repeatedly said he knew nothing of the abuse until former students began speaking out this spring, and continued to deny it on Tuesday. His denials, however, have been met with skepticism and anger from some former members of the wrestling team.Three former wrestlers told NBC News that it was common knowledge that Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments, and said it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware; one wrestler said he told Jordan directly about the abuse.Former head coach Russ Hellickson, Jordan's mentor, said in a recent video \u2014 made by Mike DiSabato, a former wrestler \u2014 that Hellickson had told Strauss that he was being too \"hands on\u201d with students.DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted Ohio State to open its investigation, called Jordan a \u201cliar.\u201d\u201cI considered Jim Jordan a friend,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201dDiSabato said he reached out to Jordan this year, before going to the university, to tell Jordan that he planned to go public with his allegations. Jordan told him to \u201cplease leave me out of it,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cHe asked me not to get him involved.\u201dhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/powerful-gop-rep-jim-jordan-accused-turning-blind-eye-sexual-n888386 "}, "replies": [" Dunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, said he and others told Jordan about Strauss.\u201cI remember I had a thumb injury and went into Strauss\u2019 office and he started pulling down my wrestling shorts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, what the f--- are you doing? And I went out and told Russ and Jim what happened. I was not having it. They went in and talked to Strauss.\u201dYetts said he and his teammates talked to Jordan numerous times about Strauss.\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Strauss\u2019s locker was right next to Jordan\u2019s and Jordan even said he\u2019d kill him if he tried anything with him,\u201d Yetts said.Yetts admitted that he did time for bilking investors out of nearly $2 million. \u201cI am not a perfect person, but ask any of the wrestlers and they will tell you everybody knew about Doc,\u201d said Yetts, who served 18 months in prison.As for Jordan, Yetts said, \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. We would have all these great talks with him and he talked about how one day he\u2019d be the president of the United States.\"\"So it\u2019s sad for me to hear that he\u2019s denying knowing about Strauss,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know why he would, unless it\u2019s a cover-up. Either you\u2019re in on it, or you\u2019re a liar.\u201dA former teammate of DiSabato\u2019s who asked not to be identified said he never told Jordan directly that Strauss had abused him. But there is no way Jordan could have avoided the rumors \u201cbecause it was all over the locker room.\u201d\u201cI love Jimmy to death,\u201d the ex-wrestler said. \u201cIt was a head-scratcher to me why he would say he didn\u2019t know anything. Doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn\u2019t do any workouts, and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down.\u201dWhen the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring, Jordan told The Columbus Dispatch, \u201cI had not heard about any type of abuse at all.\u201d He also said that \u201cno one reported any type of abuse\u201d to him. ", " After NBC News reached out to Jordan, the congressman\u2019s spokesman repeated the denial.\u201cCongressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\u201d his spokesman, Ian Fury, said in an email to NBC News.Shortly after the NBC News story was published, Fury added the following statement: \"He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.\u201dBut Kathleen Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Dayton, Ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to Ohio State, said in a statement that investigators \"had previously contacted Rep. Jordan's office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview.\"\"To date, Rep. Jordan has not responded to those requests,\" Trafford wrote. \"The investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with Rep. Jordan.\"Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative representatives, is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.Ryan, through his spokesman Doug Andres, also weighed in on the Ohio State investigation and Jordan's role.\"These are serious allegations and issues,\" Andres said. \"The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.\" ", " DiSabato forwarded to NBC News an email he sent on April 24 to Jordan and the congressman\u2019s brother, Jeff, who runs Jeff Jordan's State Champ Camp, a nationally known wrestling camp in Ohio. DiSabato sent the email 19 days after Ohio State announced on April 5 that it was investigating Strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time, including the coaches, just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances.DiSabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug, and he wanted to ensure that Jordan would back him up.\u201cI ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email,\u201d DiSabato wrote. \u201cWe [are] watching you. \u2026 You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.\u201dJordan and his brother did not reply to the email, DiSabato said. Jeff Jordan said in an email that he'd never attended or worked at Ohio State University.Jim Jordan, who has made a name for himself in Congress by grilling investigators probing alleged collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians, is among the witnesses expected to be questioned by the law firm that Ohio State hired to conduct the probe into Strauss\u2019 misconduct, officials involved with the investigation said.In the video that DiSabato made about the allegations against Strauss, which DiSabato sent to Ohio State in June, Hellickson, the former head wrestling coach, said he told school administrators about Strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers.\u201cI said, \u2018You make the guys nervous when you shower with them,\u2019\u201d Hellickson said in the video. \u201cHis response was, \u2018Coach, you shower with your guys all the time.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Not for an hour, Doc.\u2019\u201dDiSabato and his former teammates said Jordan and Hellickson were close, and if the head coach had qualms about Strauss he would have shared them with his No. 2.\u201cJim was Coach Russ\u2019 right-hand man,\u201d one former wrestler said. ", " Hellickson, an Olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for NBC Sports, did not return calls for comment.In response to a series of questions from NBC, Ohio State emailed a statement saying that the law firm Perkins Coie was overseeing the probe into the Strauss allegations for the university. OSU said it has also reached out \u201cto the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office for any potential criminal investigation.\u201d\u201cTo date, Perkins Coie has interviewed more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts,\u201d the university said in the statement. \u201cOhio State has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether former Ohio State coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from Strauss.\u201cOur efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era, what university leaders at the time may have known, and whether any response at the time was appropriate,\u201d the university\u2019s statement said. \u201cOnce the independent investigation has been completed, we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate.\u201dJordan is wrestling royalty. Born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio, he was a four-time state wrestling champion. Competing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he won NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986.But in the wrestling world, Jordan is best known for defeating future two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith twice in an NCAA tournament in 1985.Jordan returned home to Ohio and \u2014 while working as a coach \u2014 earned a master\u2019s degree in education at Ohio State and later a law degree from Capital University in Columbus before launching his political career in 1994 when he was elected to the Ohio General Assembly. ", " Strauss signed on at Ohio State as an attending physician in September 1978 and served as a team physician in the athletics department from July 1981 to June 1995, according to the university\u2019s statement. He also worked as a part-time doctor in the university\u2019s student health department from July 1994 to August 1996.After resigning from the Ohio State medical staff in 1994, Strauss stayed on as an emeritus faculty member until he retired in July 1998 and moved from Columbus to Los Angeles, the university said.Citing Los Angeles County coroner records, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strauss died of suicide in 2005 after struggling with pain and other health issues.Strauss\u2019 relatives have not spoken publicly about the allegations since they surfaced. NBC News was not able to reach any of his relatives.DiSabato, who runs a Columbus-based sports and entertainment agency called the Profectus Group, said the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar prompted him and other Ohio State athletes to come forward about Strauss.Strauss\u2019 primary job was to give wrestlers physicals, treat them for injuries and monitor their health, DiSabato said. He said Strauss also preyed on students who played other sports.\u201cStrauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at OSU from 1978 through 1998,\u201d DiSabato wrote in a June 26 email to Kathleen M. Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Columbus-based law firm that represents Ohio State. \u201cAthlete victims include members of the following programs: football, basketball, wrestling, swimming, cheerleading, volleyball, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, track and cross country.\u201dChillingly, DiSabato added: \u201cBased on testimony from victim athletes from each of the aforementioned varsity sports, we estimate that Strauss sexually assaulted and/or raped a minimum of 1,500/2,000 athletes at OSU from 1978 through 1998.\u201d ", " Ohio State has confirmed that investigators have received \u201cconfidential reports of sexual misconduct committed by Strauss\u201d from former athletes in 14 sports and from former patients in Student Health Services.In the video, DiSabato said Strauss knew that many of the athletes were small-town kids who weren\u2019t likely to protest if the doctor told them to disrobe, for fear of losing their scholarships. He said coaches knew that Strauss was a predator.\u201cEverybody knew before you were going into the [examination] room that Doc Strauss was going to touch you,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cIt was like a joke before you went in there.\u201dStrauss wasn\u2019t the only Ohio State official who showered with the team, DiSabato said. After practice ended at 3:30 p.m., some university professors, administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving, he said.It was, DiSabato said, like walking through \u201cthe gauntlet of sexual deviancy.\u201dAnother former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video DiSabato submitted to investigators described how Strauss grabbed his penis during an examination.\u201cI didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d he said when asked how he responded. \u201cProbably, because I was scared.\u201dHe broke down when asked why, after all these years, he was speaking out.\u201cWhy am I doing this now? It\u2019s just hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to ever have to happen to anybody else, ever \u2026 at The Ohio State University or any school.\u201d-----tl;dr Penn State 2.0, only this time the guy covering it up is one of Donald Trump's top henchmen in Congress.

And in all honesty the north used the blacks just as bad as the South did, basically exploiting them as Expendable troops and promising them the famous 40 acres and a mule.Granted This Promise was made by General and not a politician or the federal government, the point is that to claim the Civil War was about slavery would be short-sighted ", " >>263459Stewart, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, has been a outspoken defender of Confederate monuments.

Stewart previously worked as a co-chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in Virginia. He went on to eke out a win over a more moderate GOP candidate, state Del.

Anytime the north had a majority, they passed protectionist tariffs to favor the northeast and leave everyone else destitute with huge barriers to trade.

If you\u2019re the voting minority, you have to suck up trying to build an entirely new economic system without any cash flow or protest the barriers to trade. States rights mean the state has the power to not follow federal laws the state finds unconstitutional.

Meanwhile just a simple look at events, media, and other material from the pre-War, Civil War, and Antebellum period shows distinctly slavery-related debate and conflict, things like Bleeding Kansas and the significant publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin, not to mention Fredrick Douglas's recorded constant activism.

You can see it in the written preserved records and media on -both- sides. There wasn't any bones about it then in the South, people need to stop instilling the South with a false image of nobility and understand that it was a region ruled by an elite class whose holdings were in slave-based agriculture, and they were acting primarily to keep that very system.

You don\u2019t need as many to run a cotton gin as separating that shit by hand and decent machine harvesters were just a couple decades away.

Agriculture was inseparable from their way of life, but you can\u2019t deny they wouldn\u2019t invest in farming machines vs keeping a full plantation of slaves.

The end of slavery was more to them than a logical by the numbers approach to a shift in farming methods that would be inconvenient to suddenly enact, it was representing a rapid erasure of everything they knew and loved and threatened their social and political status, even the status of those who did not own any slaves personally. They probably would have stopped importing new slaves (it was illegal at that point anyway though smuggling occurred) and have tried to control slave breeding to some degree before thinking that it was ok to give more rights to the property that they were replacing with machines. There were a number of other menial tasks and service positions that slaves were being used for, and someone had to be around to operate the machines, and work in the new industries they would create (for free in this case). I think the South would have gone to great lengths to preserve the system and merely adapt it to technology instead of abolishing it, and though there may be sympathy for someone who would be raised in such a system to feel the way they did about preserving it, it does not in my view justify prolonging the institution of slavery for even a day. So yes, it is very fair to say though that they really did feel a need to preserve slavery (their way of life) at the time of the succession, and so to say the war wasn't about slavery is to not understand the South.

New free states were being added to the union at a faster rate than slave states (19 free states to 15 slave states before the start of the war), and the existing free states were gaining population from immigrants faster than slave states. Meanwhile, while the slave population was growing as an absolute number despite a ban on slave imports in 1807, it was shrinking as a proportion of the population (19% in 1790 vs 14% in 1860) and with each slave only counting as 3/5s of a person this meant that the existing slave states were weakening in electoral count. Eventually, the number of free states and their larger populations would eventually be able to make slavery illegal (either by law or constitutional amendment). Further, the near complete elimination of slavery in Europe (sans a few holdouts like Russia) gave increased clout to the abolitionist movement, and the election of Lincoln further stoked fears in the south that slavery would be abolished completely.The southern elite saw the writing on the wall, and moved to save slavery by making it a state issue (hence the \"states rights\" thing southerns like to say the war was about, which was also a propaganda tool to recruit soldiers for the war).

The loss of Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri would also have stung, and while West Virginia had broken away from Virginia to stay with the Union it still would have pissed them off as well. This is also why Lincoln left these five states out of the Emancipation Proclamation, in order to assure these states he wouldn't come for their slaves. It wasn't until late in the war (after the 1864 election) that he pushed for the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery completely.You're right, though, that the Emancipation Proclamation was timed specifically to prevent the entry of Britain and France as economic allies to the Confederacy. By increasing the moral stakes, he effectively cut off any support they may have continued to provide.To the other economic factors, tariffs were actually decreasing through much of the early 19th century. It wasn't until the Republicans gained control in 1860 that tariffs increased again. In a way, this was actually the north calling bullshit on the south, though both sides considered the tariff issue minor compared to the declining political power of the slave states due to territory gains by free states and the reduced economic power of the south due to industrialization.

Everyone's arguing from absolutes and claiming any compromise is a slippery slope, so when that's your baseline you're simply not going to see any reasonable solutions and just crazy extremest shit like \"take all the guns\" and \"kill all the brown people.\"Specific to guns, people I talk to who are for gun control (which includes friends and relatives) tend to not own firearms (duh) and usually live in safe areas with minimal crime and quick police response. To them, guns are a foreign, dangerous object that they don't need because they already feel pretty safe, thus their only exposure to guns is the big shootings and crime waves (similar to how people who have never met a black person in their life will be racist because their only exposure to blacks will be crime reports from the inner cities). Talk to these people in person when they're not riding high on fear from a recent shooting, and you'll find that logic will help them understand your position and acknowledge the weaknesses of theirs (and perhaps vice versa).The media, on the other hand, is just after the big headlines.

They also do bullshit like having the DMV (which issues most IDs) open for limited hours on limited days (going as far as shit like \"open only on the fifth Sunday of each month\"), but only in areas that just happen to vote for the party that didn't implement the voter ID law.

You can literally register online in many states with just a name and address, it's on the state to verify during their 2-4 week period to confirm that you are, in fact, an eligible voter in their state (which is why same-day registration requires valid ID and proof of citizenship, they don't get 2-4 weeks to confirm before you cast your ballot).>>262425I deliberately split my argument between voter ID and registration, and the part you quoted is about registration, while you are arguing about voting. In fact, you agree with the point being made in that statement, but somehow missed that it wasn't about in-person voting but registration, which is what the Kansas law was about.Again, I have no problems with ID requirements to vote, it's just that the ID laws need to be written and executed in such a way that doesn't constitute as voter suppression, meaning the IDs must be easy to acquire for all voters. Pretty much every ID law that has been struck down clearly discriminated with what counted as a valid ID or made certain areas have a harder time acquiring IDs, while all the laws that remain on the books provide fair access to IDs.For an example of good ID laws, my home state of Virginia allows basically any photo ID, issues free photo IDs, and even lets you vote without an ID with a provisional ballot. The law was challenged but was found constitutional, as there were so many options provided it couldn't reasonably be found to be discriminatory or create undue burden on voters.

Find me a court ruling that says ID is an undue burden for acquiring firearms, and then your statement will be valid. Also, if you can afford to buy a gun you can afford to get an ID; voting, on the other hand, is free and therefore it is actually possible to be too poor to get an ID (issuing easily acquired free IDs solves this problem).>>262512None of those provide a photo, thus providing no security against in-person fraud, which is what most people here are arguing about despite this law being about registration.

There's plenty of ID laws that have been upheld in courts, it's the ones that do tricky shit that get struck down as unconstitutional. And in this particular case, the ID isn't even necessary because registration is a process that the state confirms with its own information, you providing the physical documents just adds extra work (after all they're the ones who issued you your Kansas driver's license, presenting it to the registration office is just redundant).And sorry for the slightly jumbled nature of that post, I had to walk away several times to do other things and as such my train of thought wasn't exactly continuous and it shows.And to directly answer your question:>If you need an id for basically any function of adult life, then why wouldn't you require an id to vote?Because only two of those things you list are enshrined in the Constitution as rights: guns and voting. For guns, the courts have ruled that an ID check is fine, and for voting the courts have ruled both ways depending entirely of the specific law in question. If the law provides multiple avenues to acquire IDs and fail-safes for being scrubbed off the rolls, it gets ruled constitutional. If the law deliberately excludes certain types of IDs or creates significant difficulty to acquire IDs in a pattern that suggests a violation of the 15th, 19th, or 24th amendment, then it gets struck down as unconstitutional.Everything else in your list doesn't have direct constitutional protection as a right. Possessing alcohol, driving, going to school, and getting a loan are privileges, not rights, and as such the state can restrict these as much as they want (unless in the process of restricting that privilege you violate a constitutional right or piss off enough voters that you get kicked out of office).

And thank you for your friendship and for your leadership at the National Sheriffs' Association. You are one of the most respected and effective leaders in Washington.>I also want to recognize Sheriff Harold Eavenson, president of NSA. It is good to see you again. Thank you for your more than 30 years in law enforcement and service to the people of Texas, as well as your support for the Department of Justice.>I should also mention Sheriff Bob Gualtieri from Florida-he is one of the Florida sheriffs who have worked out an agreement with ICE to help them deport criminal aliens out of the Sunshine State.>I also want to thank Secretary Nielsen and Congressman Scalise for being here.>It is an honor to be with you all once again. With more than 20,000 members and 75 years of history, the National Sheriffs' Association is one of the largest and oldest law enforcement groups in America.>Before I say anything else, I want to take a moment to remember Deputy Sheriff William Gentry who served for 13 years in the Highland County Sheriff's Office in Florida. Last month, he gave his life in the line of duty.>His loss is a reminder that law enforcement faces danger each and every day. You put yourselves in harm's way so that the rest of us can live in peace. You are the thin blue line between life and death, between safety and lawlessness.>This is a difficult job, but when rules are fairly and consistently enforced, life is better for all- particularly for our poor and minority communities.>Most people obey the law. They just want to live their lives. They're not going to go out and commit violent crimes or felonies.>As my former boss, President Reagan used to say, \"Most serious crimes are the work of a relatively small group of hardened criminals.\">That is just as true today as it was back then. ", " >>261621>That's why we've got to be smart and fair about how we identify criminals and who we put behind bars and for how long.>This association, Jonathan, and your leaders have studied these issues for years. Getting this issue right is extremely important. Lives are at stake.>I want to call your attention to something important. A few weeks ago, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics released a new report on the recidivism rate of inmates released from state prisons in 30 states.>This is the longest-term study that BJS has ever done on recidivism and perhaps the largest. It was designed by the previous administration. The results are clear and very important. The results are of historic importance. The reality is grim indeed.>The study found that 83 percent of 60,000 state prisoners released in 2005 were arrested again within nine years. That's five out of every six.>The study shows that two-thirds of those - a full 68 percent - were arrested within the first three years. Almost half were arrested within a year - one year - of being released.>The study estimates that the 400,000 state prisoners released in 2005 were arrested nearly 2 million times during the nine-year period - an average of five arrests each.>Virtually none of these released prisoners were arrested merely for probation or parole violations: 99 percent of those arrested during the 9-year follow-up period were arrested for something other than a probation or parole violation.>In many cases, former inmates were arrested for an offense at least as serious - if not more so - as the crime that got them in jail in the first place.>It will not surprise you that this is often true for drug offenders. ", " >>261623>Many have thought that most drug offenders are young experimenters or persons who made a mistake. But the study shows a deeper concern.>Seventy-seven percent of all released drug offenders were arrested for a non-drug crime within nine years. Presumably, many were arrested for drug crimes also. Importantly, nearly half of those arrests were for a violent crime. We can't give up.>These are grim findings indeed.>Understanding the reality of crime requires clear eyes.>This study was a product of the previous administration's methodology. Indeed, the methods of information gathering and statistical analysis have been used for years. In fact, a comparable report was released under President Obama.>This tells us that recidivism is no little matter. It is a fact of life that must be understood.>But overall, the good news is that the professionals in law enforcement know what works in crime. We've been studying this and working on this for 40 years.>From 1964 to 1980, the overall violent crime rate tripled. Robbery tripled. Rape tripled. Aggravated assault nearly tripled. Murder doubled.>And then, from 1991 to 2014, violent crime dropped by half. Murder dropped by half. So did aggravated assault. Rape decreased by more than a third, and robbery plummeted by nearly two-thirds.>That wasn't a coincidence. Between that big rise in crime and that big decline in crime, President Reagan and the great Attorney General Ed Meese went to work.>There was the elimination of parole, the Speedy Trial Act, the elimination of bail on appeal, increased bail for dangerous criminals before trial, the issuing of sentencing guidelines, and in certain cases, mandatory minimum sentences. ", " >>261625>We increased funding for the DEA, FBI, ATF, and federal prosecutors. And most states and cities followed Reagan's lead. Professionalism and training dramatically increased in local law enforcement.>These were the biggest changes in law enforcement since the founding of this country. These laws were critical to re-establishing public safety.>When a criminal knows with certainty that he is facing hard time, he is a lot more willing to confess and cooperate with prosecutors. On the other hand, when the sentence is uncertain and up to the whims of the judge, criminals are a lot more willing to take a chance.>Many of our cases in federal court involve quite significant offenders we worked with you to apprehend.>The certainty of a significant and fixed sentence helps us get criminals to hand over their bosses, the kingpins and the cartel leaders-and helps remove entire gangs and criminals from the street. Left unaddressed these organizations only get richer, stronger, more arrogant and violent placing whole neighborhoods in fear.>Law enforcement officers understand that. Sheriff Eavenson and NSA have been critical allies in the fight to preserve mandatory minimums for a long time-and I want to thank you for your strong advocacy. Many doubt their value.>Maybe this is obvious, but a recidivist can't hurt the community if he is incarcerated. A lot of people who would have committed crimes in the 1990s and 2000s didn't because they were locked up. Murders were cut in half after 1980.>How many did not die or suffer because of the historic decline in crime?>Look, our goal is not to fill up the prisons. Our goal is to reduce crime and to keep every American safe. We should not as a policy keep persons in prison longer than necessary. But clear and certain punishment does in fact make America safer. ", " >>261626>The day I was sworn in as Attorney General, President Trump sent me a clear order. And, let me tell you, Donald Trump knows how to give a clear order. He told me to \"reduce crime in America.\" Not to preside over ever-increasing crime. Take action and bring down crime.>In 2015 and 2016 the overall violent crime rate went up by nearly seven percent.>Robberies went up. Assaults went up nearly 10 percent. Rape went up by nearly 11 percent. Shockingly, murder increased by more than 20 percent. All after decades of decline.>President Trump is having none of it. He said bring down crime. Make this country safe.>Improved professionalism in all areas of law enforcement and some excellent legislation were major factors in the long crime decline.>Congress helped us then and we need their help now.>One of the most important laws that President Reagan signed into law was the Armed Career Criminal Act.>That's the law that requires a minimum 15- year sentence for felons caught with a firearm after their third robbery or burglary conviction.>These are not so-called \"low-level, nonviolent drug offenders\" who are being picked on. These are criminals who have committed multiple serious offenses.>In 2015-after 30 years on the books-one critical line of the law was struck down by the Supreme Court as being too vague.>But because of this impactful ruling, every federal prosecutor lost one of their most valuable tools and they ask me for help regularly.>Just one example is Jeffrey Giddings of Oregon. He had more than 20 convictions since 1991. He was let out of jail after the Court ruling and only 18 days later shot a police officer and held two fast food employees hostage. He has now been sentenced to another 30 years in prison. And the last thing he did before being put back in jail was to lash out in a tirade of profanity at police. ", " >>261627>That officer should never have been shot. Jeffrey Giddings should have been behind bars.>More than 1,400 criminals-each convicted of three felonies-have been let out of jail in the three years since the Court ruling. And so far, more than 600 have been arrested again.>On average, these 600 criminals have been arrested three times since 2015. A majority of those who have been out of prison for two years have already been arrested again.>Here in Louisiana, nearly half of the released ACCA offenders released because of this court ruling have already been rearrested or returned to federal custody.>These numbers are staggering, but they are still likely an underrepresentation of these criminals' illegal activity. Any sheriff in this room will tell you that criminals rarely get caught on their first offense. We can only imagine how many innocent people have been victimized.>Releasing these hardened criminals into our communities before they serve their minimum term is not fair to crime victims. And it is not fair to law enforcement.>You and your deputies shouldn't have to go into danger time and again to arrest the same people.>In this noble calling, all of us in this room are leaders. The NSA is fulfilling its responsibility in this regard. We must communicate sound principles to our policy leaders and to the American people when it comes to reducing crime:>A small number of people commit most of the crimes;>Those who are jailed for crimes are very likely to commit more crimes-often escalating to violent crimes-after their release; and>Congress and our legislatures must consider legislation that protects the public by ensuring that we incapacitate those criminals and deter others>And so the point is this: we should always be looking for effective and proven ways to reduce recidivism, but we must also recognize that simply reducing sentences without reducing recidivism unfairly creates more victims. ", " >>261629>This Department of Justice under President Trump is committed to working with you to deliver justice for crime victims and consequences to criminals. We want to be a force multiplier for you.>The President has ordered us to back the women and men in blue and to reduce crime in America. And that's what we intend to do. We embrace that mission and enforce the law with you.>I'd like to discuss one last thing when it comes to enforcing our laws before I leave you. There is an important conversation occurring in this country about whether we want to be a country of laws or whether we want to be a country without borders. It is one of the reasons the American people elected President Trump- to end the lawlessness at our southern border.>Importantly, some years ago, it was decided law enforcement might arrest some people who crossed the border illegally by themselves but anyone who brought a child with them would effectively be given immunity from prosecution.>Word got out about this loophole with predictable results. The number of aliens illegally crossing with children between our ports of entry went from 14,000 to 75,000-that's a 5-fold increase-in just the last 4 years. This cannot continue.>We do not want to separate children from their parents. We do not want adults to bring children into this country unlawfully, placing them at risk.>But we do have a policy of prosecuting adults who flout our laws to come here illegally instead of waiting their turn or claiming asylum at any port of entry. We cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws.>After the policies of the last 8 years, we had hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors coming through our borders - which has led to a resurgence of the violent MS-13 gang terrorizing high schools and even middle schools in Maryland and Long Island. Most of the children we are caring for came without adults. ", " >>261630>In total, HHS is spending over a billion taxpayer dollars a year caring for these minors. That is an enormous cost that we bear because we sent a message to those crossing illegally to bring children and avoid prosecution and deportation. This country is dedicated to caring for children.>We have a generous, lawful system that admits over a million people a year with legal status. But when we ignore our laws at the border we obviously encourage hundreds of thousands of people a year to likewise ignore our laws and illegally enter our country, creating an enormous burden on our law enforcement, our schools, our hospitals, and social programs.>President Trump has said this cannot continue. We do not want to separate parents from their children. If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness, we won't face these terrible choices. We will have a system where those who need to apply for asylum can do so and those who want to come to this country will apply legally. The American people are generous people who want our laws enforced. That is what we intend to do, and we ask Congress to be our partners in this effort.>Thank you again for having me here today. It is always an honor to speak to you-the front lines of our nation's law enforcement. Because you and I know what works. We've reduced crime in America before; we can do it again.>And in this joint effort, you can be certain about this: we have your backs and you have our thanks. ", " Can I just point out that DHS Secretary Nielsen and Att. Gen. Sessions are saying exclusively contradictory things about this policy?>sessions: it's a deterrent to stop people from trying to cross the border.>Nielsen: no it's absolutely not, that would be offensive ", " >>261651who cares. nielsen is just trying to be PC.its a deterrent to stop people from trying to cross the border, plain and simple ", " >>261655>two cabinet members can't agree on a police's purposeNo, no.

Though it wouldn't surprise me to find approval for this that low. Most Americans opposed the DACA repeal as well (83% of the general populous - 75% of Republicans).Oddly, I was one of the few who didn't. I actually have no problem with illegals coming over and taking over low end jobs, as I don't live in a shit hood, and that helps the overall economy (indeed, there are large sectors of said that'd be unviable without them). But illegals that are trying to make something of themselves by going to college are actually taking jobs from well to do and hard working Americans, and unlike the shit jobs, those are scarce, in addition to requiring ludicrous investment for most citizens to acquire. ", " >>261934If you take in the shit tier immigrants they have kids who go to college and take our jobs, fill up our schools, and they themselves use up our welfare which is a drain on middle income tax burden since the rich don't pay tax ", " >>261959Educated people don't qualify for welfare, their jobs are too good. ", " >>261959>they have kids who go to college and take our jobs>implying Trump voters have college educated jobsI can't tell if you're pretending to be retarded, or actually are. Last I checked, the economy is at full employment (the Fed wouldn't raise interest rates otherwise), so labor is actually in shortage. The more workers we have, the more that gets done. The more that gets done, the better off we are. It isn't rocket science. Maybe that went over your head; I'll use conservative logic instead. So the Mexicans work harder than the white trash. To make it in this economy, you have to work hard. So the white trash deserves to lose their jobs.Still not following? Well I guess I'm not gonna convince you, so might as well spit into the wind and use evidence (not that Trump voters will ever pay attention to something as inane as data).https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/09/18/who-receives-benefits-from-the-federal-government-in-six-charts/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9759d4800439The vast majority of government entitlement spending goes to the middle class. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Middle Class makes up about 60% of the population... and receives 58% of the benefits. The top 1% is getting shafted sure, but with rising income inequality, America is becoming increasingly Oligarchic. The fact that figures like the Koch brothers were able to fund a decades-long anti-union propaganda campaign that convinced a bunch of poor white factory workers that the true enemy was unions is proof of this. If you're really concerned about the welfare of the 1%, go fuck off to CATO and leave us alone, but the fact that you're shitposting on 4chan means you aren't rich yourself.

When Berman pushed him, asking if he truly felt comfortable getting damaging information on Clinton from a Russian, Caputo said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having a meeting with someone who\u2019s not representing a foreign government for dirt on Hillary Clinton.\u201dRecords of the Caputo and Stone conversation after the Greenberg meeting have been released. Caputo started it, asking, \u201chow crazy is the Russian?\u201dStone replied: \u201cHe wants big $ for the info waste of time.\u201dCaputo responded: \u201cThe Russian way.

The 34-year-old man was going to pick up his wife and daughter, who were living in Russia\u2019s Samara region at the time, and decided to hitchhike instead of taking the bus. To cut his trip short, Novikov decided to cut through neighboring Kazakhstan, and in order to avoid any unnecessary trouble, he headed to the Isikul Road border post. Once there, he asked the border guards if he could cross the border on foot, but before answering him, they demanded that he present his backpack for inspection. And that\u2019s when everything started going downhill for Novikov.While searching through the backpack, the border guards found a plastic bag labeled \u201cDiabetisan\u201d containing a blend of different dried plants. Alexei explained that as both the name of the product suggested, this was an all-natural herbal tea for the prevention of diabetes. The bag even featured a description in Spanish, which read \u201csix unique herbs for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\u201d, and the man even encouraged the suspicious guards to brew some and try it for themselves. They didn\u2019t take him up on his offer. Instead, they called a cynologist and a sniffer dog.Not having smelled anything dubious in the bag, the Cocker Spaniel turned away indifferently from the tea. The border guards didn\u2019t write this in their report, but the surveillance footage later requested by Novikov\u2019s lawyer clearly showed that the dog did not detect any narcotics.http://www.odditycentral.com/news/the-sad-case-of-a-man-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-over-a-bag-of-herbal-tea.html "}, "replies": [" Alexei Novikov was allowed to cross the border, but the bag containing \u201ca dark green substance of vegetable origin with a characteristic smell of mint tea\u201d (as noted in the report) was confiscated in the presence of a witness. The 34-year-old did not object, but tried to explain that he had imported the tea from Peru as a health supplement. That didn\u2019t seem to interest anyone, but at least he was free to go. Unfortunately, that was not the end of it.Three months after the border crossing incident, Alexei Novikov was put on Russia\u2019s criminal wanted list, and on January 29, 2016, he was detained, charged with \u201cillegal acquisition of narcotic drugs\u201d as well as \u201cdrug smuggling\u201d and taken 800 km away from his home to a maximum security detention center. In November of 2016, Novikov was sentenced to 10 years and one month in a strict regime prison colony.Alexei\u2019s lawyer claims that the case is a disgrace to the Russian justice system, and claims that there is clear proof that the prosecution presented forged evidence in court. For example, the tag used to seal the bag seized from his client was not the one presented in court \u2013 the first had the signature of the senior officer present at the border crossing at the time of the confiscation, while the one examined by a state expert is signed by another officer, who had finished his shift before Alexei arrived at the border post.Furthermore, the bag presented in court did not feature the aforementioned Spanish description of the contents, and in the report of the border guard who inspected Alexei\u2019s backpack, the line \u201cdark green substance with a mint smell\u201d was replaced with \u201ca brown substance with a sharp, specific smell\u201d. ", " Andrei Vlasov, Novikov\u2019s lawyer, claims that Judge Beloborodov from the Isilkul Town Court didn\u2019t even consider all this proof of evidence tampering, and since the expert\u2019s report concluded that the confiscated substance tested positive for \u201csynthetic cannabinoids\u201d also known as \u2018Spice\u2019, she convicted Alexei to over a decade in prison.Despite all the issues highlighted by Novikov\u2019s lawyer in court, he has been rotting in prison ever since the judge\u2019s verdict. His lawyer appealed to higher courts, and produced even more proof of faulty evidence from the prosecution, including the narcotic expert\u2019s report.The expert did not substantiate why he referred the substance to narcotics \u2013 there are no descriptions, graphs, no references to scientific data, although the federal law requires that the expert\u2019s conclusions be scientific, repeatable, verifiable. In addition, the study was conducted on unchecked equipment \u2013 there is no information that the gas chromatograph, used by the expert, passed, as it should, an annual check. I insist that this is not an expert conclusion, but speculation that the court did not check,\u201d Yulia Kopeikina, a lawyer working with Vlasov, told Novaya Gazeta.\u201cHow could Novikov know or suppose that there are narcotic substances in the tea that he bought on the Internet? He did not hide from the border guards, and he went to the checkpoint by naivety, and did not try to hide the package, kept it in a backpack in a conspicuous place and showed it at the first request,\u201d lawyer Sergei Eremin added. \u201cThe article on which he was convicted suggests direct intent, and if he is not, then there can be no crime. Both the city court of Isilkul and the Omsk regional court violated the fundamental principle of a civilized state \u2013 the presumption of innocence.\u201d ", " Last month, Alexei\u2019s lawyer managed to get his case reviewed by another panel of judges, who dismissed the charge of \u201cacquisition of narcotic drugs\u201d but maintained that of \u201csmuggling of drugs\u201d. They decided to leave the accused\u2019s prison sentence unchanged \u2013 10 years and one month.Alexei Novikov\u2019s case has become a central focus of Russian human rights activists who have vowed to seek a repeal and file another complaint to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.In the meantime, Novikov is stuck in prison, his wife has been stripped of parental rights and their daughter is now in the care of her grandmother.

The plot was thwarted by federal authorities in October 2016.\u201cHere\u2019s a militia group that was active on social media and they were going to do their attack the day after Election Day at a time when the Russians were engaging in a stealth cyberattack on our democracy,\u201d Levin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure if there\u2019s a connection to this effort by Russia, but at the very least, they were adding gasoline on a fire that they knew would take place.\u201cSocial media has been weaponized, and these militia folks were People\u2019s Exhibit A of how that could happen.

The study found that the Internet Research Agency overwhelmingly focused its social media campaign on race, promoting ads designed to inflame racial tensions in the U.S.According to the report, the number of divisive racial ad purchases averaged about 44 per month from 2015 through the summer of 2016, then rose significantly in the run-up to the November election.

Levin said the analysis found a clear connection between the frequency of the racially motivated Russian ads and the number of bias crimes reported. As the number of racially divisive Russian ad purchases rose, they found, so did the number of hate crimes that were reported.The center\u2019s new report, \u201cHate Crime Rise in U.S. Cities and U.S. Counties in Time of Division and Foreign Interference,\u201d also found that hate crimes reported to police in America\u2019s 10 largest cities rose 12.5 percent in 2017.

In his year leading EPA, he has overhauled several scientific advisory panels to include more industry representatives and recently ordered limits on the kinds of scientific studies the agency will consider on the health effects of pollution.On the other hand, Pruitt has also called water pollution one of his signature priorities.The chemicals at issue in the HHS study have long been used in products like Teflon and firefighting foam, and are contaminating water systems around the country. Known as PFOA and PFOS, they have been linked with thyroid defects, problems in pregnancy and certain cancers, even at low levels of exposure.The problem has already proven to be enormously costly for chemicals manufacturers.

Jackson confirmed the outreach last week, saying it is important for the government to speak with a single voice on such a serious issue.\u201cEPA is eager to participate in and, contribute to a coordinated approach so each federal stakeholder is fully informed on what the other stakeholders' concerns, roles, and expertise can contribute and to ensure that the federal government is responding in a uniform way to our local, state, and Congressional constituents and partners,\u201d Jackson told POLITICO via email. ", " >>252075Pruitt has made addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, a priority for EPA. The unpublished HHS study focused on two specific chemicals from this class, PFOA and PFOS.States have been pleading with EPA for help, and experts say that contamination is so widespread, the chemicals are found in nearly every water supply that gets tested.In December, the Trump administration's nominee to head the agency's chemical safety office, industry consultant Michael Dourson, withdrew his nomination after North Carolina's Republican senators said they would not support him, in large part because of their state's struggles with PFAS contamination. Dourson's previous research on the subject has been criticized as too favorable to the chemical industry.Shortly after Dourson's nomination was dropped, Pruitt announced a \u201cleadership summit\u201d with states to discuss the issue scheduled for next week.In 2016, the agency published a voluntary health advisory for PFOA and PFOS, warning that exposure to the chemicals at levels above 70 parts per trillion, total, could be dangerous. One part per trillion is roughly the equivalent of a single grain of sand in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.The updated HHS assessment was poised to find that exposure to the chemicals at less than one-sixth of that level could be dangerous for sensitive populations like infants and breastfeeding mothers, according to the emails.Dave Andrews, a senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group, said those conclusions line up with recent studies on the health effects of PFAS.\u201cThey are looking at very subtle effects like increased risk of obesity for children exposed in womb, lowered immune response, and childhood vaccines becoming not as effective,\u201d Andrews said. ", " >>252076The HHS document at issue is called a toxicological profile, which describes the dangers of a chemical based on a review of previous scientific studies. It would carry no regulatory weight itself, but could factor into cleanup requirements at Superfund sites.EPA scientists, including career staffers, were already talking with the HHS researchers about the differences in their two approaches to evaluating the chemicals when officials at the White House raised alarm in late January, the emails show. Those differences, according to the correspondence, stemmed from the agencies\u2019 use of different scientific studies as a basis, and from taking different approaches to accounting for the harm that the chemicals can do to the immune system \u2014 an area of research that has burgeoned in the two years since EPA issued its health advisory.Enck, the former EPA official, said she sees one troubling gap in the emails: They make \u201cno mention of the people who are exposed to PFOA or PFOS, there\u2019s no health concern expressed here.\u201d ", " >>252072>the agency was helping \u201censure that the federal government is responding in a uniform way to our local, state, and Congressional constituents and partners.\u201dthe fuck is that even supposed to mean in this context? is the nu-epa even capable of communicating a coherent thought any more?

It seems he was put in charge of the EPA solely to dismantle it rather than run it. As is tradition in this administration. ", " >>252070While I don't at all agree with the decision to withhold the report, it's not an unusual phenomenon for PFAS investigation reports around the world. The article here mentions that PFAS compounds have been found contaminating military bases, chemical plants and other sites. This doesn't even touch on the scale of the problem. Every single airport that has ever had a fire training excercise conducted on it in the last ~50 years will have measurable PFAS impacts in nearby soil and groundwater. Looking at a big example here in Australia, the town of Katherine which is 20 kms from a defence base, previously sourced all of their drinking water from groundwater. The scale of the PFAS contamination has meant that all of their drinking water is now classified as dangerous to human health and as a result the Defence Department now supplies bottled water to the entire town. Airports around Australia have been monitoring PFAS contaminant plumes for years and have known that they flow into residential areas, but have deliberately held off releasing these results because of the public backlash and the remediation and compensation costs that will result. That's what Pruitt et al are trying to delay.If you own a property that is immediately down hydraulic gradient from an airport or defence base, sell your property before they release their report on PFAS contamination, because your house prices will plummet after they have.

Sometimes mistakes happen, and West Japan Railways (also known as JR West) screwed up badly enough last Friday that the company felt an official apology and press release were in order.According to the press release, on the morning of May 11, a train at Notogawa Station in Shiga Prefecture, part of the Biwako Line, mistakenly pulled away from the platform at 7:11:35 a.m. If you think it\u2019s a little strange to see the time written like that, rest assured that it\u2019s not the normal way of doing things in Japan, but JR West felt it necessary in order to fully disclose the damage, as the train left 25 seconds earlier than its scheduled time of 7:12.In its press release, JR West solemnly stated:\u201cThe great inconvenience we placed upon our customers was truly inexcusable.\u201dThe trouble started when the conductor of the train (an express that makes its final stop at Nishi Akashi Station in Hyogo Prefecture at 9:14) mistakenly thought it was supposed to leave at 7:11, and so closed the doors of the 12-car train at that time.

It was a pretty major topic that popped up several times, and was also covered in the middle school version of the US history class (I remember this because we had a fucking mock trial for Custer. That same teacher also simulated trench warfare and the stock market, he was pretty rad). Japanese internment was also covered, as well has healthy debate over the morality of nuclear weapons and strategic bombing in general. So American education does cover the dark parts of US history.The specific example of the occupation of the Philippines was not covered, only their acquisition in the Spanish-American War and the WWII battles over them (I do not remember Filipino independence being covered either). In the defense of the curriculum, the specifics of the Philippines is pretty narrow for a class that have to cover the entire history of the United States (and the preceding colonies and native history) in a single year. It also doesn't feed back as much into the fabric of American society like Jap internment and the treatment of natives, since those had lasting domestic consequences.But yeah, none of that is mandated by law directly, but can appear on the statewide standardized test at the end of the year as well as the AP test if you took the AP version of the class. Since it was a statewide standard however, means other states might not cover those topics or could cover additional topics. ", " >>251055When I was in high school native americans were barely covered. Maybe a small portion of a textbook mentioned them. Anecdotal experiences. ", " >>251057Not even the French and Indian War? Natives in my classes were covered in a few distinct periods from what I remember:>prehistory>precolonial>early colonial>French and Indian War>trail of tears>westward expansionThis isn't including the two years of world history classes that came before that covered the mesoamerican civilizations in greater detail (though obviously not that much detail, 2 years is not a lot of time for the whole world's history).This does demonstrate how different the standards are from state to state, hell even teacher to teacher if there's not state standard or test. Another topic you'll see vary in history classes across America is what the civil war was about: northern states are more likely to say it was slavery while southern states are more likely to say it was state's rights (and if your teacher was any good they would have said it was more complicated than those simple self-serving answers). This variation goes beyond history into English (what pieces of literature do you consider important?) and science (evolution, though this topic is a bit more \"why are you insisting that we teach nonscientific philosophy like creationism?\"). Math is pretty much the only core subject that has universal standards, it's just a question of the availability of advanced math classes (my school district had a lot of variation, you could start algebra as early as 7th grade or as late as 10th grade, with Calculus BC being offered as early as 10th grade if you one of the early algebra kids).

Rwanda, well, hadn't happened yet. I think our history texts even mentioned the Armenian genocide, but only offhandedly.We also covered the civil rights movement pretty thoroughly, even though some states, such as Texas, ban that now.I'm fairly certain covering WWII and the holocaust has been a requirement of every school curriculum in the nation since 1945 (including Texas). It also comes up in the SAT's, so it's more or less a Federal requirement.

Giuliani\u2019s media blitz to convince the public that neither Donald Trump nor his lawyer had violated the law by paying a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair might have backfired, giving investigators new leads to chase and new evidence of potential crimes, legal analysts said.Giuliani made statements that speak to Trump and lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s intent \u2014 an important aspect of some crimes \u2014 and he made assertions that investigators can now check against what they have already learned from documents and witnesses, legal analysts said. His comments to media outlets underscore a growing tension for the White House: The FBI investigation of Cohen presents a legal problem for the president that his own lawyer might have exacerbated.\u201cI\u2019m sure his strategy was damage control,\u201d said Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the University of Michigan, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure he controlled much.\u201dStarting with a Fox News appearance on Wednesday night, Giuliani, who joined Trump\u2019s legal team just a few weeks ago, seemed to be trying to play down Cohen\u2019s $130,000 payment in October 2016 to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and President Trump\u2019s reimbursement of his longtime lawyer. He might have been trying to get ahead of investigators in making public facts they already know, though legal analysts said his statements could reinforce any case they might bring.Giuliani first contradicted Trump\u2019s assertion last month that he was unaware of the payment to Daniels, then offered details of which federal investigators are sure to take note. He mused on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d for example, about what might have happened to Trump\u2019s campaign had Daniels made her allegation on the eve of the election. "}, "replies": [" \u201cImagine if that came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cCohen didn\u2019t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.\u201dThat comment is important because it suggests Cohen made the payment with the intention of protecting the Trump campaign. In that case, the payment would constitute a campaign contribution or loan \u2014 rather than a personal expense. Such a contribution would have to be reported publicly, and the amount would have far exceeded the legal limit of $2,700 that Cohen could have given.Matthew Sanderson, who served as a campaign finance lawyer for the 2008 McCain-Palin campaign, said the timing of the payment \u201cstrongly suggests it was related to the election, and therefore is either a contribution, or at least a reportable expenditure by the campaign.\u201dBut Charlie Spies, who served as counsel for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said Giuliani\u2019s comments must be weighed against Trump\u2019s history of aggressively protecting his corporate and personal reputation.\u201cRemember, at this time, people didn\u2019t expect him to win, so his business and personal reputation were much more important,\u201d Spies said. Trump himself asserted Thursday on Twitter that Cohen \u201creceived a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign\u201d and that he used that retainer to pay Daniels.Campaign finance violations can be difficult to prove. Federal prosecutors failed in their effort to convict former North Carolina senator and Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards of accepting illegal campaign contributions for payments made to a woman with whom he had an extramarital affair and fathered a child. ", " Giuliani also revealed what legal analysts say might be tantalizing leads for investigators, who already were exploring Cohen\u2019s business practices and whether any crimes may have been committed as part of a pattern or strategy of paying hush money to keep damaging stories about Trump from appearing when he was a candidate, according to people familiar with the matter.In an interview with The Washington Post, Giuliani said that Trump paid Cohen $35,000 a month as a retainer and that \u201cthere probably were other things of a personal nature that Michael took care of, for which the president would have always trusted him as his lawyer, as my clients do with me. And that was paid back out of the rest of the money. And Michael earned a fee out of it.\u201d He declined to specify what those things might be. \u201cI think they were all certainly much less significant than the $130,000,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they made up even an appreciable portion of the amount.\u201dIn addition to discussing the payment to Daniels, Giuliani asserted that Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director because Comey would not reveal publicly that the president was not under investigation. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.\u201cI think even asking him to publicly exonerate him does interfere with the investigation and could constitute obstruction of justice,\u201d McQuade said.Giuliani said the president paid Cohen $35,000 monthly for a period of time in 2017. Precisely when the payments started and stopped is unclear; at one point, Giuliani indicated there could have been payments in 2018. He also said the Daniels settlement was covered by those payments.Investigators are likely to ask witnesses about the topic and compare what Giuliani said publicly about Trump\u2019s arrangement with Cohen with what people have told them in the past, McQuade said. Lying to federal investigators is a crime, though lying on TV is not. ", " McQuade said investigators are also likely to explore money-laundering issues, though legal analysts said that, by themselves, Giuliani\u2019s comments did not present clear evidence on that front.For prosecutors to charge someone with money laundering, the money at issue has to come from a crime, and paying someone to keep quiet does not qualify. It is possible, though, that the money should have been reported on a financial disclosure. Norm Eisen, chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said his group had filed a complaint saying Trump should have reported it.\u201cIt\u2019s not strictly criminal money laundering unless the underlying money is proceeds of another crime, and I don\u2019t think we have any indication that that\u2019s the case,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Randall Eliason.The growing legal questions around Cohen\u2019s services for Trump come as the lawyer faces a grand jury investigation being led by federal prosecutors in New York City who are exploring bank fraud, wire fraud or campaign finance charges, according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.That case, according to officials, stems from a referral made by Mueller but has functioned as a stand-alone case in New York for months. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election, as well as whether the president obstructed justice.Trump\u2019s and Cohen\u2019s lawyers believe the New York investigation is largely aimed at pressuring Cohen to cooperate with the special counsel team, according to several people familiar with their discussions. They believe investigators want to push him to reveal his conversations with Trump amid Russian efforts to help his campaign. ", " The Manhattan prosecutors\u2019 search warrant for Cohen\u2019s home and office \u2014 which FBI agents executed on April 9 \u2014 specifically sought communications between Cohen and Trump. The agents seized boxes of papers and more than a dozen digital devices. Those electronic and paper documents are now being reviewed by a court-appointed special master to determine what material is protected by attorney-client privilege and what is eligible to become part of the criminal investigation of Cohen. That process is expected to take weeks.Two lead prosecutors handling the case \u2014 Thomas McKay and Nicolas Roos \u2014 are part of the public corruption unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan and prosecute public officials and people engaged in conspiracy or fraud against the government. Trump advocates argue the corruption unit wouldn\u2019t be involved unless their work was steering toward the president.\u201cThis is about trying to get the president,\u201d said one person familiar with the Trump lawyers\u2019 discussions.A spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Biran, who is now in private practice at Rifkin Weiner Livingston, said it is possible that investigators already know what Giuliani revealed publicly Wednesday and that his TV appearances were merely an attempt at \u201ctrying to get out in front of it.\u201dGiuliani and Stephen Ryan, who is Cohen\u2019s lawyer, have known for weeks of Trump\u2019s reimbursing Cohen, but even people who were close to Trump were stunned by the news that Giuliani divulged late Wednesday evening.\u201cI think there are two issues \u2014 there are the legal issues, and then the political side of it,\u201d Biran said. \u201cReasonable minds can differ about whether politically it\u2019s a good tactic to reveal this information in the way he did. ... I think that Mueller\u2019s going to find out what the facts are, so that makes me think he was more worried about the political calculus.\u201d ", " McQuade said Giuliani\u2019s TV interviews might have been an effort to speak to Cohen and to reassure him that the White House still has his back. \u201cMaybe the strategy there is to try to calm him down so he\u2019s not tempted to cooperate,\u201d she said.After all, legal analysts said, charging Trump\u2019s lawyer with a campaign finance or bank fraud violation seems far less weighty than Mueller\u2019s pursuit of potential campaign coordination with Russia.\u201cI feel like a few months from now, campaign finance violations are going to be the least of these guys\u2019 worries,\u201d Eliason said.---Good job Rudy, you just admitted Trump violated campaign fiances laws and obstructed justice.

Trump reimbursed via \"retainer\" (not scare quotes -- it's just that nobody on any side has seemed to argue that Trump's regular payments to Cohen qualify as the legal definition of a retainer) after the election. At an amount exceed 10k that's a loan for a campaign, and thus falls under campaign finance.2) Even if Trump reimbursed Cohen right away, or if Trump paid Stormy directly, you can't make huge >$5k payouts under the table while you're in a declared campaign for political office in the U.S. All that stuff has to be filed with the FEC. In practice the FEC looks the other way or gives a chew-out all the time to politicians for small unrelated expenditures under $10k, often because new pols don't know the law well, but this is a $130k payment and Trump had at least a few seasoned campaign staffers as well as Cohen who knows at least enough campaign finance law to retain his bar license over the decades.3) Apparently the stuff on Cohen is much much worse, though we (the public) still don't know whether or not the deep shit relates directly to Trump.

They support access to contraception and sex education in schools and support public schooling and social services to help women support a child so they don't have to turn to abortion. Democrats aren't naive enough to believe they can just outlaw a problem to make it go away, they try to take a more comprehensive approach to it instead.

If the majority was flipped and the finding was the opposite (\"majority Democrat committee finds evidence of collusion\") it would be equally worthless. A final vote split along party lines often indicates everyone's decision making was based on politics and not evidence. If you had a bipartisan agreement on the finding (or even a bipartisan disagreement) the results of the committee would be more valid, as it looks less likely that everyone was motivated purely by political interest. This rule applies to pretty much everything in politics, a bipartisan agreement will always hold more water than a partisan split (especially a perfectly partisan split).>GOP and Trump are the same thingOh man, it's not like Trump ran for president as the GOP's nominee. It's not like the GOP has a vested interest in making sure their president is successful and not mired by controversy since it helps them pass their agenda and get reelected. Nope, they're two completely separate entities with completely divorced goals and objectives.With less sarcasm: while Trump and the mainline GOP's goals are not in 100% alignment, one is definitely part of the other. While \"the house committee investigated itself\" is certainly incorrect, but you'd have to be an idiot to read the other guy's statement as such and not \"we, the GOP, investigated one of our own and found no evidence.\"Plus you have Devin Nunes being a retard the whole time and making his own committee look like a sham by running to Trump every five seconds.

Meanwhile at Pearl, the US was convinced there would only be secondary sabotage attempts or attack runs by shitty minisubs, so they threw up some anti-sub nets and parked the boats close together with the crews on board (as opposed to on shore) to make them easier to guard vs saboteurs.

The statement came following a series of airstrikes against Syrian targets by the United States, United Kingdom and France earlier this month in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.The apparent chemical attack against the then-rebel-held city of Douma in central Syria killed at least 40 people, including children. Western powers blame the attack on Assad\u2019s regime.\u201cA few years ago at the request of our partners, we decided not to supply S-300s to Syria,\u201d Lavrov told the BBC last week. \u201cNow that this outrageous act of aggression was undertaken by the US, France and UK, we might think how to make sure that the Syrian state is protected.\u201dRussia had originally agreed to sell the system to Syria in 2010, but scrapped the plan at Israel\u2019s behest.[cont'd] "}, "replies": [" Lavrov\u2019s comments to the BBC indicated that the impetus for Russia to reverse its decision and give Assad the S-300 was not the airstrike allegedly conducted by Israel on April 9, but the American-French-British attack on April 13.According to Kommersant\u2019s report, Russia will not be selling Assad the S-300 system, but rather providing it at no cost as part of a military aid package in order to hasten the delivery.The Russian-made system offers long-range protection against both fighter jets and missiles. The system has been supplied by Moscow to Tehran, and deployed by the Russian army in Syria, alongside its more advanced iteration: the S-400.Israeli officials have expressed concerns that selling the S-300 system to Damascus could weaken Israel\u2019s regional air supremacy.Therefore, Israel might look to destroy the defense system, preferably before it is set up and made operational.Israel\u2019s former Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin, who currently heads the influential Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said he assumed the air force would work quickly to destroy the S-300.\u201cIf I know the air force well, we have already made proper plans to deal with this threat. After you remove the threat, which is basically what will be done, we\u2019re back to square one,\u201d Yadlin told Bloomberg news last week.In what many saw as a direct reaction to the looming proliferation of the S-300 and other missile defense systems throughout the Middle East \u2014 but especially in Iran \u2014 Israel purchased a fleet of F-35 stealth fighter jets from the American Lockheed-Martin defense contractor.The state-of-the-art planes are meant to offer a solution to the challenges posed by the S-300, whose radar systems can detect aircraft from some 300 kilometers (186 miles) away.[cont'd] ", " Israel also worked diplomatically to attempt to stop Russia\u2019s sale of the S-300 system to Iran, which after being halted for nearly a decade went through in 2016. Last year, Tehran announced that the system was fully functional and connected to the rest of the country\u2019s air defenses.In addition to the American-led coalition\u2019s strikes against Assad targets, Israel has increasingly carried out air raids in Syria, which it says are meant to prevent the transfer of advanced weaponry to the Hezbollah terrorist group and halt the military entrenchment of Iran in the country.While Israeli officials acknowledge that these strikes are carried out in general, Jerusalem rarely takes responsibility for specific attacks.On April 9, Israel allegedly struck the T-4 air base in central Syria where Iran has reportedly been operating a fully functional air base of its own and where it has centered its attack drone operations. At least seven members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in the strike. The base was reportedly protected by surface-to-air missile defense systems.Satellite photographs of the base published on Sunday showed the strikes were carried out with a high degree of precision, hitting two hangars, but causing little damage to the surrounding area.[cont'd] ", " While refusing to comment on whether it carried out the strike, a few days later Israel revealed for the first time that an Iranian drone dispatched from T-4 in February was an attack drone that carried explosives and was headed to an unspecified location in Israel when it was shot down 30 seconds after entering Israeli airspace.Israel lost an F-16 in retaliatory raids hours after the drone was downed on February 10, the first loss of a fighter jet in action in 35 years. The Israeli plane was hit by Syrian anti-aircraft fire, and crashed in Israel; the two pilots ejected to safety.Following the downing of the F-16, Israeli aircraft targeted Syria\u2019s air defenses, destroying between one-third and one-half of them, according to Israeli military estimates.

As more shootings happen, pressure builds. Pressure releases naturally over time (as people forget), but can also be released faster when the problem is seen as being addressed (new legislation, new security measures, etc). Right now there's been far too many shootings to the point where the natural pressure release isn't doing shit, and there has been zero action for artificial pressure release. The left hasn't passed any gun control, and the right hasn't done jack shit about the issues they blame instead of guns (mental health, video games, more guns, whatever). This apparent lack of action has caused shit to boil over, especially as the shootings have escalated in frequency and scale.To illustrate my pressure cooker idea, here's a timeline of major shootings (with body count) and gun control legislation since the 1980s:1980s>1982 Wilkes-Barre (13)>1983 Wah Mee (13)>1984 San Ysidro (22 including shooter, high score holder for 7 years)>>1986 FOPA>1986 Edmond Post (15 including shooter)1990s>1991 Luby's (24 including shooter, high score holder for 15 years)>>1994 AWB passed>1999 Columbine (15 including 2 shooters)2000's>>2004 AWB expires>2007 Virginia Tech (33 including shooter, high score holder for 9 years)>2009 Geneva County (11 including shooter)>2009 Binghamton (14 including shooter)>2009 Fort Hood (13)2010's>2012 Aurora (12)>2012 Sandy Hook (28 including shooter)>2013 Navy Yard (13 including shooter)>2015 San Bernardino (16 including 2 shooters)>2016 Orlando (50 including shooter, high score holder for 1 year)>2017 Sutherland Springs (27 including shooter)>2017 Las Vegas (59 including shooter, current high score holder)>2018 Stoneman Douglas (17)Notice how the frequency of shootings went up (and the rate of record breaking), and notable legislation dropped from once a decade to never (and technically negative in one decade).

First, the pressure cooker idea can be applied to other problems, and is thus a natural phenomenon. Let's look at another mass casualty type: bombings. These things followed a similar pattern, except the casualty numbers for the average attack is much lower. In fact, there are many incidents of nobody dying, or even just the bombers dying. These incidents don't drive up the public pressure sufficiently until the 90's, when suddenly every other motherfucker decides since the commies are no more it's time to topple the American government.>1993 WTC bombing (6 dead, 1k wounded)>1995 Oklahoma City (168 dead, 500 wounded, deadliest bombing in US history)>1996 Atlanta Olympcs (2 dead, 100 wounded)>1998 Birmingham Abortion (1 dead, 1 wounded) *this one is more in line with pre-90's bombingsThis culminates in the 2001 9/11 attacks, which, while not bombings, were the capstone of the 90's terror wave. This lead to the massive increase in counter-terrorism, and a massive overhaul in counter-terror investigation and interdiction (huge pressure release). From this point on it won't be until the 2013 Boston Marathon bomber that any bomb succeeds in detonating, and even then the casulty numbers were brought back in line to their pre-90's levels.Second, by correlating these two together we can see how waves of violence build on themselves. When one group isn't stopped, they don't just step up their own game, but they inspire others to try bigger, bolder plays. Oklahoma City doesn't happen without previous bombings demonstrating weaknesses in US security. Similarly, more shooters have gleaned information off each other's shootings and increase their effectiveness.[out of characters, continuing...] ", " >>241871 [continued]I'm personally amazed it took this long for someone to have the idea of the Vegas shooter, which combines the high target density of school shootings with the range advantage of the Texas bell tower shooter. In the case of bombings, the massive crackdown and increase in investigative power not only capped off the previous wave but prevented it from building out of control. For instance, the most recent Texas bomber was barely able to pull off his spree compared to the previous Unabomber as few other bombers have been around to probe the bomb security network of the US.Third, there should naturally be more shootings due to the increase in use population. Assuming only crazy idiots do these things, and crazy idiots are a fixed % of the population, there should be more of them in absolute terms. Even if the shooting per capita doesn't change, the absolute number of newsworthy shootings should rise because the threshold for media attention does not really change (though if the average casualties per event continue to increase we may see the bar for newsworthiness rise).Fourth, we haven't seen any real effort to stop these shootings. Sure we have plenty of talk, good and bad ideas (loads of bad ideas), but nothing substantial has been passed or approved. Again, the left has passed no gun control measures, the right has done nothing about mental health, and for everyone in between there doesn't seem to have been any effort by law enforcement to improve or adjust their handling of these active shooter events. In comparison, since 2001 the US has fucking cracked down on bombings, law enforcement is on top of those things and slipping up on only three notable occasions in over 15 years (aforementioned Boston Marathon and Texas bombers as well as that other fairly recent bombing in NYC), all of which were less deadly than most of the notable shootings in that same time frame (though the wounded numbers are higher). ", " >>241876 [concluded, there are days I really wish they increased the character limit just for this board]So taking all that in, I don't think there's any nefarious force driving up either the shootings or the protests about said shootings. There simply too many crazy assholes feeding into each other, and not enough real solutions to counteract them. I think there's genuinely a lot of people who are sick of all the violence, the problem is the proposed solutions don't sit right with large portions of the population. The left thinks removing guns is the solution, which the right will never have because that violates the constitution. The right wants to just arm everyone and hope MAD works at an individual level, while the left thinks that's just going to make things worse.It's essentially a negative feedback loop. There is no widely popular solution that won't potentially create more problems than it solves. Because there is no solution, shooters are embolden to carry out their crimes. And because the crimes continue, pressure builds for a solution. Return to step 1.

You always get it wrong. There's only one type of study that matters and that's one that can be held up by its peers in the policy research field as having controlled its variables -- there are very few of those, and they find either specific effects of specific policy measures or no effects for general weak measures. Nobody in any such controlled study has found that wholesale removal of controls makes things safer in some way, partly because it's hard to find test cases of that get a good measure of any sort of gun policy -- especially a negating policy -- but to say otherwise is disingenuous. 3) Just because some heretics/morons buy an AR-15 chambered for a 9mm Parabellum, that doesn't mean there's no difference between an assault rifle and a pistol, and you fucking know it.

The national party isn\u2019t promoting its role in the group, but its fingerprints are all over it.>The 30-second commercials, which the group is spending nearly $700,000 to air, accuse Blankenship\u2019s company of contaminating drinking water by pumping \u201ctoxic coal slurry,\u201d even as the multimillionaire installed a piping system that pumped clean water to his mansion.>\u201cIsn\u2019t there enough toxic sludge in Washington?\u201d the narrator intones. ... "}, "replies": [" >The assault comes amid rising fears from national Republicans that Blankenship is gaining traction ahead of the May 8 primary. The Republican hopeful has spent his own money to fund a $1.3 million TV ad blitz in which he portrays himself as the casualty of an Obama-era Justice Department bent on locking him up. He has far outspent his primary opponents, Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, whom he castigates as pawns of the GOP establishment.>Washington Republicans have spent weeks deliberating whether to go after Blankenship, who was released from prison in May after a one-year sentence. They\u2019re worried that he would destroy the party\u2019s chances of defeating Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November.>At the same time, they\u2019ve been concerned that attacking him would allow Blankenship to portray himself in the race as the embattled adversary of powerful D.C. interests. The scenario is similar to the one that played out in last year\u2019s Alabama Senate race, when the party spent millions of dollars in an unsuccessful effort to stop former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore from winning the GOP nomination.>The national party, perhaps worried about Alabama-style backlash, is not taking credit for the attack or for Mountain Families PAC. But the connections are conspicuous.>According to federal disclosures, the commercials were overseen by several firms that in the past have worked closely with Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that openly led the assault on Moore. They were produced by GOP ad-making firm McCarthy, Hennings, Whalen and were placed on TV by the media buyer Main Street Group, both of whom were paid thousands of dollars by Senate Leadership Fund during the 2016 election cycle....

During the 2016 cycle, the firm received over $1.5 million from Senate Leadership Fund, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.>Representatives for Senate Leadership Fund did not respond to requests for comment, or to inquiries about whether it had a role in orchestrating the attack.>The ties between Mountain Families PAC and the national party do not end there. The super PAC lists an Arlington, Virginia, P.O. box that\u2019s previously been used by a number of GOP entities. Among them: a fundraising account benefiting former Republican Sen. Luther Strange, who was the party favorite in last year\u2019s Alabama contest.>The treasurer for Mountain Families PAC, Benjamin Ottenhoff, did not respond to a request for comment. Ottenhoff has previously worked for several party organizations, including the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee.>The ads represent the GOP\u2019s most aggressive action yet against Blankenship.

And now the feared gun grab is occurring. Residents in Deerfield, Illinois have 60 days to surrender their \u201cassault weapons\u201d or face fines of $1000 per day per gun. The gun ban ordinance was passed on April 2nd with residents left with few choices of how to dispose of their valuable \u201cassault weapons.\u201d Upon careful reading of the ordinance, residents will be left with revolvers, .22 caliber \u201cplinking\u201d rifles, and double barrel shotguns to defend their homes and families from criminals who could care less about the law. Fines for not disposing of the weapons range from $250 to $1000 per day per gun for those who choose not to comply with the city\u2019s ordinance. While a fine may seem reasonable to some, as TFTP has reported on multiple occasions, failure to pay fines always results in police action. It is not far-fetched to predict major turmoil and arrests in the event of non-compliance. One example of the so-called \u201cassault weapon\u201d is the Ruger 10/22 which can accept magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Even though the 10/22 is not listed in the list of guns the village wants to see banned, the gun cannot legally be possessed in the village. Residents have been instructed to either sell their guns, transfer the ownership to someone who lives outside the village, surrender their guns to Deerfield\u2019s sheriff, or begin paying the fines. cont. "}, "replies": [" >>243690Deerfield mentioned a number of cities where mass shootings took place, including Sutherland Springs, TX where 26 people were killed in the First Baptist Church. That shooting was actually stopped by a man who used the very gun Deerfield voted to ban. No mention was made of that fact in the ordinance. Also included in the gun ban were semi-automatic pistols which can accept higher than 10 round magazines. That\u2019s virtually all full size semi-automatic pistols. Even though the village trustees ignored the pleas of residents to leave their guns alone, and passed the ordinance anyway, many residents were encouraged to ignore the gun ban and engage in civil disobedience. Joel Siegel, a resident of Lincolnwood, warned the village\u2019s residents that governments all across the world have moved to confiscate guns then turned around and ran roughshod over the people. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s an ancient and honored American tradition called disobeying an unjust law\u2026I have urged (people) to listen to their conscience and if so moved do not obey this law.\u201d Deerfield Mayor Harriet Rosenthal implied the students from the local high school helped sway her decision to bring about the ordinance. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Rosenthal said adding, \u201cThose students are so articulate just like our students. There is no place here for assault weapons.\u201d cont. ", " >>243691The statement mirrors the knee jerk reaction to ban guns following a nationwide public outcry of students who supposedly feared for their own lives following the recent mass shooting in Florida. Opponents of the gun grab vow to fight the action in court while others praised the trustees decision to ban semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns. Ariella Kharasch, a Deerfield High School senior said she wants more action to be taken on both a local and national level. \u201cThis is our fight\u2026This is our generation\u2019s fight. We\u2019re going to keep fighting and this is part of it. Change happens gradually step by step. The fight does not end at the borders of our village.,\u201d Kharasch said. Predictably, law enforcement and retired law enforcement members of the community are exempted from the ban. Currently, in the U.S., law enforcement kills around 1,200 citizens per year. Ironically, that number is actually four times higher than those who die from rifles. As TFTP has reported, cops have killed 450 percent more people than have died in the past forty years of mass shootings.

Bet this faggot would have been scalped.

It upheld DC's \"assault weapon\" ban as Constitutional, that includes a ban the AR-15 (as well as a lot of semi-automatic magazine loaded pistols). This is why no one has managed to lift any other municipal or state ban against the AR-15, or any other \"assault weapons\" ban.The good thing about the ruling is it upheld a universal right to self-defense that had been pretty much denied since the dawn of the 2nd amendment. For near two centuries it was merely treated as a mandate that the federal government could not disarm the states by disarming their citizens, but the states were free to regulate their defense as they saw fit, as it was deemed a collective right (culminating in US v. Cruikshank). The Heller and Miller cases combined to finally make it an individual right.The bad thing about the ruling is that it more or less ended defense against government tyranny as a form of self-defense, practically declaring such a concept defunct, and only recognizes the right of personal defense. It thus indirectly denies the state right to defend itself against Federal tyranny through unregulated militia, as well as that of the people. Thus the states and even the federal government can still ban \"assault weapons\".We may only need one more SCOTUS replacement to fix that ruling, but the less people who are aware of the current state of the law, the less apt such a case is to come to the court to give it an opportunity to repair that injustice. The people need to be able to arm themselves sufficiently to at least give the government pause, if the 2nd amendment is to continue to act as a check against tyranny. The 2008/2010 decisions got us halfway to the true spirit of the 2nd amendment - it's up to us to push it the rest of the way there. (But of course, we need not to be in denial of the need to do so.)

City attorneys sought to persuade Circuit Judge Bob LeBlanc to extend the temporary ban a year.\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with the issuing of the initial temporary injunction. I think that\u2019s exactly what the statute provides for,\u201d LeBlanc said. But the judge declined to extend the ban.Velasquez, 21, is the first person against whom the Orlando Police Department has sought to obtain a \u201crisk protection order,\u201d a newly created type of civil injunction that allows law enforcement to seize firearms from people deemed by a court to be mentally ill or who present a violent threat to themselves or others. The extension also could have affected Velasquez\u2019s ability to get certain jobs and could expose him to other criminal liabilities, his lawyer Kendra Parris said.Parris said Velasquez was being punished for legally protected speech. She argued Velasquez had not done anything to suggest he would act on the comments. He had not purchased a weapon, and he does not have a criminal record, she said, adding that he would have voluntarily relinquished his gun rights had he been given the option.The city\u2019s attorney, Alexander Karden, said the intent of the legislation is to allow courts to order mental health treatment before a person commits a crime. Karden pointed to psychological evaluations that he said place Velasquez on step three of five steps of progression toward committing violence.http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-hearing-risk-protection-order-velasquez-20180402-story.html "}, "replies": [" \u201cHe\u2019s following the trajectory. \u2026 This statute is not designed for someone who\u2019s already gone over the top. It\u2019s designed to stop them before they get there,\u201d Karden said.City attorneys, who can appeal the decision, declined to comment after the hearing.University of Central Florida Police Officer Jeffrey Panter said he started investigating Velasquez after getting reports from the school community about a user on the online social media platform Reddit called \u201cTheRealUCFChris\u201d who called Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz and Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock heroes.Panter interviewed Velasquez, who answered a series of hypothetical questions about committing a mass shooting. Panter asked if his target would be UCF. Velasquez answered he would probably do it at the middle or high school where he was bullied. He also said it would take a tragic life event such as a breakup or firing from a good job to provoke him.His lawyer argued against portions of the statement and quoted Velasquez in the nearly two-hour recorded interview, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine myself ever doing that. It would take a lot to push me over the edge.\u201dVelasquez was taken to a mental health facility after the interview under Florida\u2019s Baker Act, which allows people to be involuntarily detained and given emergency mental heath evaluations if they are believed to be a threat to themselves or others. The doctor who evaluated him deemed he was not a threat.Panter, joined by an FBI special agent and a Orlando police detective, went to Velasquez\u2019s home, where his father voluntarily gave them his own revolver and let them search his son\u2019s room.Velasquez, who is still enrolled in classes, was issued a trespass order from campus, and his conduct is being reviewed by the university, UCF Police Department spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin said. ", " Parris said Velasquez got online and acted \u201clike a jerk\u201d on a forum that is \u201cnotoriously vulgar.\u201d She again pointed to his interview with police, in which Velasquez said he regretted his comments, didn\u2019t think before he typed and \u201cwanted to look like a badass on Reddit.\u201dThe elder Velasquez stood behind his son with his arms crossed and shook his head in response to parts of the city attorneys\u2019 arguments. He testified on behalf of his son and said he was not concerned that his son would be violent. Velasquez\u2019s family embraced him after the judge\u2019s ruling.The family will pursue civil action against Orlando police, Parris told the Orlando Sentinel.\u201cFor a person with a history of bullying, I cannot tell you how horrifying this has been.

In countries with robust social safety-nets that's not a big deal, but in the US protection against hardship varies greatly between states and even districts, if you're born in the wrong neighborhood, generational poverty is still not all that uncommon.

Matt Bevin for his signature or veto.According to a summary, the bill would place teachers hired after Jan. 1, 2019, in a hybrid cash-balance plan at Teachers\u2019 Retirement System of Kentucky rather than a traditional pension, but it would not reduce the annual 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustments for retired teachers, which was a controversial part of Senate Bill 1. Retired teachers in Kentucky do not get Social Security benefits, so any freeze in their pensions affects their total retirement income.Retirement eligibility for future teachers would increase to age 65 with five years of service or the \u201crule of 87\u201d (when the employees\u2019 combined age and years of service equal 87).

Moscow vehemently denies responsibility and has vowed a \"tough response\" to the expulsions.>More than 20 countries on Monday announced that they were expelling a total of more than 130 Russian diplomats, including 60 kicked out by the United States. Australia, Belgium, Ireland and Moldova joined them Tuesday.>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance also would expel seven staffers from the Russian mission and deny the pending accreditation requests of three other workers at the Russian mission.>Stoltenberg said \"we will continue to work for meaningful dialogue\" with Russia, but added that the measure announced Tuesday should \"send a very clear message to Russia that it has costs.\">\"I actually think that Russia has underestimated the unity of NATO allies,\" he said.>The White House said that President Donald Trump spoke Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the leaders \"expressed support\" for the expulsions and \"praised\" the announcement by others who have followed suit.>On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his country was expelling two Russian diplomats whom he described as undeclared intelligence officers. They have been given seven days to leave Australia. Turnbull slammed Russia for \"reckless and deliberate\" conduct that he said harms global security and violates rules against the use of chemical weapons.>The Russian Embassy in Canberra said the decision was regrettable and jeopardized bilateral relationships. "}, "replies": [" >\"It is astonishing how easily the allies of Great Britain follow it blindly contrary to the norms of civilized bilateral dialogue and international relations, and against ... common sense,\" it said.>Ireland also announced it was ordering one Russian diplomat to leave. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney called the nerve-agent attack on Skripal and his daughter a \"shocking and abhorrent\" use of chemical weapons.>Belgium followed suit, saying it would expel one Russian diplomat.>And Moldova, the ex-Soviet nation whose pro-Western government is seeking closer ties with the West, on Tuesday also ordered three Russian diplomats to leave within seven days.>Bulgaria, which has so far refrained from ordering any Russians out, said it has recalled its ambassador to Moscow for \"consultations.\">The Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition after they were found unconscious on March 4 in the English city of Salisbury, where the former spy lived. Britain says they were poisoned with a Soviet-made military-grade nerve agent known as Novichok.>Moscow has dismissed the British accusations as baseless, emphasizing that it completed the destruction of its Soviet-era chemical arsenals last year.>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov blamed the U.S. for strong-arming its allies to expel Russian diplomats.>Speaking on a trip to Uzbekistan, Lavrov said the U.S. has applied \"colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which have become Washington's main instrument on the international arena.\" He warned that Moscow will retaliate for the expulsions, saying \"such boorishness can't be tolerated.\">Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, derided last week's presentation for foreign diplomats made by the British Embassy in Moscow as a \"manipulation of public opinion,\" noting that it lacked any evidence. \"It's a major failure of Theresa May,\" she said on Facebook, referring to the U.K. prime minister.

", " An analysis from the Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/putin-skripal-expulsion-russia-poisoning-trump/556556/>One of Putin\u2019s greatest assets has been his capacity to break the rules of international behavior, as Western countries try and preserve them. As a result, he has been able to game out likely responses, staying clear of red lines and exploiting opportunities that arise. That does not mean he and his advisors don\u2019t get things wrong (like the time Russia moved into the Donbas in Ukraine and expected Kiev to quickly capitulate). But they believed they understood the West, and that ultimately Western countries would not act decisively in support of each other. This time, he miscalculated.>In the near term, the Kremlin will respond with its usual mix of malice and bluster. There will be aggrieved denunciations, reciprocal expulsions, maybe even escalation, in the form of sanctions against Western media and cultural organizations (Moscow has already closed down the British Council\u2019s operation in Russia), the suspension of cooperation agreements, and perhaps even pressure on other fronts such as Syria, Libya and the Balkans. Ultimately, though, Russia needs the West more than the West needs Russia. There are likely to be some hurried and anxious recalculations in Moscow as Putin and company realize how badly they blundered.>The Kremlin has relied on its own will and the West\u2019s divisions to play a weak hand well. But maybe it played one card too many.I tend to agree with this line of thought. Russia at some point realized that in a world full of Western countries who \"play by the rules\" and respond with incoherence and confusion when other people don't, there would be plenty of room for Russia to maneuver the situation to its advantage. I'm genuinely surprised that the West - and Trump's America, no less - found the balls to do anything about it.

", " >>241212Everybody who works in the national security or diplomatic corps of every nation in the world that isn't Russia.Though honestly you could probably include Russia in that list without any problems. ", " >>241216Why would they do that?And why would they do that with a weapon only they own?It doesn't make sense.They have nothing to win doing so, and everything to lose. It's completely retarded, and Putin is far from being retarded. ", " >>241217Because they got away with it a dozen times already and the UK never did shit. Remember when Berezovsky said that he was terrified that Russia would kill him, and then he was found hanged inside his house despite having being excited about his upcoming holiday, and the UK ruled it a suicide? Or when they poisoned Litvinenko, and the UK spent like ten million dollars proving that it was Russia wot done it, and then did nothing? Putin had no reason to believe that the UK wouldn't act like the same massive beta bitch they had been acting like for the past ten years.>And why would they do that with a weapon only they own?The Russians have claimed that both the United States and the United Kingdom have Novichok production capability. There's a simple explanation here: Russians assassinated yet another enemy of Putin (see also: Litvinenko, Politkovskaya, Perepilichnyy, Berezovsky, Puncher, Nemtsov, Voronenkov, etc, etc, etc), and a fucking goofy explanation: that the CIA did it. On whose order, exactly? Trump's? Pompeo? Maybe it was Obama's deep state agents. At the end of the day if you're going to reject a plausible theory because it has problems, you have to come up with an alternative theory that at least makes a LITTLE bit of fucking sense.>They have nothing to win doing soRussia has been assassinating traitors for years. Their aim is to prove that the wages of treason are death. Here's a statement made on Russian state television: \"I don\u2019t wish death on anyone, but for purely educational purposes, I have a warning for anyone who dreams of such a career. The profession of a traitor is one of the most dangerous in the world.\"Real fucking subtle, those Russians. ", " >>241218Rink also said that it can be made by any private pharmaceutical industry.

It's in fact true that if this was a massive false flag, then yes, they wouldn't let Moscow see the evidence.

Since this is in the northeast, that spur doesnt dull on rockey terrain like most birds so it just keeps getting sharper, longer and more curved as they age. Normally Turkeys bolt when they hear a twig snap a half mile away and avoid anywhere that a human smell even wafts into. If that bird is in a home its likely got a parasite or a brain fever thats making it extremely aggressive, and its now in front of you with a pair of razor sharp hooks. They are literally raptor talons, its just very rare that a situation arises that someones hit because of how skittish the birds normally are.

If Harris had been convicted, he would have faced up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine.The acquittal is a relief for Harris, who was beaten inside a parking garage next to the city\u2019s police department on Aug. 12, 2017. He suffered a spinal injury and head lacerations that required 10 stitches.Two months later, his legal path took an unexpected turn when Crews filed a police report and persuaded a Charlottesville magistrate to issue an arrest warrant in October on a felony charge of unlawful wounding, which carries a five-year maximum sentence. The news was cheered online by supporters of white nationalism, which is focused on the goal of achieving a whites-only state.Before issuing his ruling Friday, Downer warned the crowd to \u201crestrain\u201d their emotions. As he spoke, it was unclear how he would rule, and many attendees \u2014 nearly all of them Harris supporters \u2014 looked worried. The judge condemned the Unite the Right ralliers and counterprotesters.\u201cThe behavior I\u2019ve seen is appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cI can say this without question \u2014 that there was bad behavior all around.\u201dHe also defended Crews. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that he did anything wrong that day at all.\u201d "}, "replies": [" In the end, the judge declared Harris not guilty because he did not intend to hit Crews with a flashlight and was trying to defend his friend, who was in a struggle with Crews.\u201cI cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that [Harris] intended to hit Mr. Crews with [the flashlight].\u201dAfter he said the words \u201cnot guilty,\u201d the audience erupted. They considered Harris the only victim of what happened that day during the parking garage confrontation.Online sleuths, led by Black Lives Matter activist and Intercept journalist Shaun King, helped track down the identities and whereabouts of several men police say assaulted Harris: Jacob Scott Goodwin of Arkansas; Daniel Borden of Ohio; Alex Michael Ramos of Georgia; and Tyler Watkins Davis of Florida. Trials are scheduled for late April and early May; Davis\u2019s trial has not been set.YouTube footage from the rally shows a complicated sequence of events that led up to Harris\u2019s beating, outside the Market Street parking garage, where dozens of members from the League of the South and Traditionalist Worker Party converged with counterprotesters.In one piece of YouTube footage, Crews is clasping a large flagpole in front of another black protester, Corey Long, who is tugging on the other end. As Long and Crews tussle over the pole, Harris, standing next to Long, swings a flashlight at Crews, whose head snaps back to the right, appearing as though he\u2019d been struck on the head or shoulder. Crews, wearing a sport coat and bow tie in the courtroom, testified that his injury from the flashlight amounted to a large welt and several deep cuts.Harris testified that he swung the flashlight at Crews only because he believed Crews was attacking his friend and wanted to knock away the flagpole.\u201cI [saw] Mr. Crews driving his flag into Corey, and that\u2019s when I tried to break up the altercation with the flashlight,\u201d Harris told the judge. ", " Harris said he did not bring the flashlight to the rally as a weapon. Instead, he said, another counterprotester gave it to him for protection.Moments after the altercation with Crews, several men \u2014 one of them dressed in military tactical gear and holding a plastic shield \u2014 stormed into the garage, chasing Harris and forcing him to the ground, where he was pummeled.Video of Harris\u2019s beating tore through the Internet. The ferocity of the assault heightened the public outcry over the rally, where a driver also plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer . James Alex Fields Jr., 20, has been charged with murder in her death. The rally was organized to oppose the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue from Emancipation Park.After the event, critics questioned the strategy and planning of the Charlottesville Police Department, whose officers frequently stood to the side and did not try to halt skirmishes or get between ralliers and counterprotesters. In December, an independent review commissioned by the city was released, and it concluded that the department\u2019s planning was \u201cinadequate and disconnected\u201d and that the officers\u2019 lack of preparation led to \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences.The report, prepared by Timothy Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said that after Harris swung his flashlight at Crews and ran into the garage, he either tripped or was pushed to the ground. He was \u201cdefenseless against a mob of angry Alt-Right demonstrators\u201d who beat him with flag sticks, shields and pieces of wood, the report said.When Harris escaped, the report said, he was found by Charlottesville Sheriff James Brown. By then, the report said, Harris\u2019s head had been split open, and he was bleeding.A day after the attack, Harris set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his medical bills \u2014 he wound up more than tripling his goal of $50,000.

People are carrying real hate in their hearts for the Black Community,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I refuse to just let it happen.\u201dAfter the trial was over Friday, Harris stayed inside, away from the crowds, but his attorney, Rhonda Quagliana, emerged for a short news conference.\u201cDeAndre and his parents want peace in this community,\u201d she said, describing him as \u201ca young person who came here to live and work.

It was feared this would cut Australia off from the United States.But the Japanese had another goal in mind.It wanted to finish the job it had started at Pearl Harbor.It wanted to entice the remnants of the Australian and United States navies \u2014 along with its aircraft carriers \u2014 into an ambush. It almost worked. A running battle ensued between May 4 and 8, 1942. Two US aircraft carriers, USS Lexington and Yorktown, led the Allied resistance. The Lexington was critically damaged. Despite the best effort of its crew, it was reduced to a burning wreck. It had to be scuttled.

While fleets had played war-games involving aircraft carriers in the decades between World War I and II, the reality of their power \u2014 and vulnerability \u2014 had yet to be felt. Britain\u2019s aircraft carrier experience between 1939 and 1942 had been very different. It had been fighting against land-based bombes in the narrow waters of the North Sea and Mediterranean. Several valuable ships had been sunk by submarine and warships. HMS Illustrious had barely survived a Stuka dive-bombing attack off Malta.http://www.armouredcarriers.com/adm26783/2014/10/16/illustrious-january-10-damage-report-bomb-shellBut, as neither Germany nor Italy had aircraft carriers of their own, such a clash had not been on the cards.So when the USS Lexington and Yorktown went up against the IJN Shokaku and Shoho, it was a fight like no other that had gone before.http://www.navy.gov.au/history/feature-histories/battle-coral-seaLexington was big. But she was also relatively old. She had initially been intended to be built as an enormous, fast, battlecruiser. But treaties put paid to that idea part way through her construction. So, instead of wasting the partially completed hull, she was converted to an aircraft carrier.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJuDkzM6ucAt Coral Sea, both sides detected each other Both sides launched strike groups. The US aircraft had difficulty finding their targets. The Japanese did not. USS Yorktown took one bomb hit. The Lexington took two torpedoes and two bombs. \u201cLady Lex\u201d was left heeling heavily, with fires raging out of control along her length. ", " There was hope to save the ship: her engines remained intact. But nothing could stop the fires.Eventually the flames found areas filled with fuel fumes that had seeped out of their containers because of the shock of the hits. Lexington was rocked by another two explosions, and erupted into a fireball.https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/w/war-damage-reports/uss-lexington-cv2-war-damage-report-no16.htmlAfter six hours battling to save the ship, USS Lexington had to be abandoned. Some 2770 crew were rescued. But 216 went down with their ship. An escorting destroyer was given the task of putting the wounded aircraft carrier out of its misery. It was the first battle in history where ships of neither fleet had set eyes on each other.WATERY GRAVEPaul Allen\u2019s research vessel Petrel located the wreck of the USS Lexington yesterday.According to a post on the philanthropist\u2019s website, it rests some 800km off the coast of Queensland at a depth of about 3kmThe find was the result of a six month project. Photos so far returned by RV Petrel\u2019s submersible show several aircraft that have tumbled out of the carrier and on to the ocean\u2019s floor. Their original markings and paintwork remain remarkably clear.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K-V_ah6IIsThe ship itself, while showing heavy scarring from the battle and the stresses of diving 3km to the sea floor, is also well preserved. Gun mounts and other fittings show only little sign of corrosion and deterioration. \u201cTo pay tribute to the USS Lexington and the brave men that served on her is an honour,\u201d Allen said in a statement. \u201cAs Americans, all of us owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who served and who continue to serve our country for their courage, persistence and sacrifice.\u201d Allen\u2019s expeditions have returned a haul of discoveries from World War II.The cruisers USS Indianapolis and destroyers USS Ward and Italian Artigliere were found last year. ", " The cruiser USS Astoria and Japanese battleship Musashi in 2015.SACRIFICE AND GAINBoth sides declared the Battle of the Coral Sea a victory. Both were right. It was a Japanese tactical victory. They had sunk more ships than they had lost. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Strategically, the US and Australia had turned the invasion force back. But, more importantly, the allies had also inflicted losses on Japanese ships, aircraft and aircrew. Japan, for its part, lost the light carrier Shoho. And the fleet carrier Shokaku came out of the clash heavily damaged.Significantly, Japan was not in a position to quickly replace them.\u201cAs we look back on our Navy throughout its history, we see evidence of an incredible amount of heroism and sacrifice,\u201d retired US Navy Rear Admiral Sam Cox says on Allen\u2019s website. \u201cThe actions of Sailors from our past inspire us today. So many ships, so many battles, so many acts of valour help inform what we do now.\u201dAdmiral Harris said the Lexington represented the strength of the US-Australian alliance.\u201cWe help secure the peace in the IndoPacific today alongside our allies and partners, including Australia, where I am currently visiting to meet with my counterparts and reinforce our amazing alliance,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ll visit the Australian War Memorial to honor those Australians who also paid the ultimate sacrifice in defending freedom across the globe.\u201d ", " Cool I guess.

The Blue plans increased premiums by more than 25 percent on average in 2017, meaning many insurers charged enough to cover their customers\u2019 medical costs for the first time since the Affordable Care Act marketplaces launched in 2014 with robust coverage requirements.\u201c2017 was the first year we got our head above water in the individual market since the ACA passed,\u201d said Steven Udvarhelyi, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana.However, one good year won\u2019t ease the trepidation many insurers feel as they start planning for 2019. After knocking out the law\u2019s individual mandate and a subsidy program worth billions of dollars to insurers late last year, the Trump administration is soon expected to finalize rules making it easier to buy cheaper plans exempt from some Obamacare rules.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve turned the corner,\u201d said Kurt Kossen, president of retail markets at Health Care Service Corporation, which operates Blue plans in five states. The insurer lost $2.5 billion on its individual market business during Obamacare's first three years, he noted. \u201cOne year of being able to make a profit out of four certainly is not a stable market,\" he said. https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/17/obamacare-insurers-2017-profit-analysis-422559 "}, "replies": [" The POLITICO analysis found the Blue plans spent an average of 80 percent of premium revenues on medical costs last year. That\u2019s below the 85 percent threshold that\u2019s viewed as a rough benchmark for profitability, and it\u2019s a 12 percentage point improvement over 2016.\u201cThey understand the risks of the market better now than they did at the start of the ACA exchanges,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who has written extensively about the marketplaces.The gains were particularly notable among some of the biggest insurers. Health Care Service Corporation spent 77.7 percent of premiums on medical claims, an improvement of 18.5 percentage points over the prior year. Similarly, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina saw its margin improve by just over 10 percentage points.But not all insurers have figured out how to make money in the troubled markets, which have failed to attract enough young and healthy customers to function effectively in many states. Of the 29 insurers analyzed, eight plans spent more than 90 percent of premium revenues on medical costs last year, meaning they almost certainly lost money in the marketplaces.The POLITICO analysis provides a snapshot of financial performance in the marketplaces in 2017, not a definitive portrait. Combined, the 29 Blue plans had 4.5 million individual market customers at the end of last year, accounting for about one-fifth of the total market for people who buy their own coverage.The healthier balance sheets are a welcome development for insurers after three years of major Obamacare losses, estimated at more than $15 billion by McKinsey. That led many national insurers, including UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, to flee the law\u2019s marketplaces, in some cases leaving Blue Cross Blue Shield plans as the only option for customers. ", " But their improved financial fortunes could also complicate efforts to convince Republican lawmakers to support an Obamacare stabilization package as part of the massive spending bill Congress is trying pass by March 23. Lawmakers are looking to add new funds to help insurers with especially sick customers and restore a subsidy program known as cost-sharing reductions that helps insurers pay medical bills for their low-income customers.However, a dispute over abortion language is holding up the Obamacare package in Congress. And many conservatives are wary of providing more funding to prop up the marketplaces, deriding it as a bailout for insurance companies.\u201cThe rates can stay low without these payments,\u201d said Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, regarding the cost-sharing reductions that President Donald Trump cut last fall.Insurers argue that looking at financial performance over a single year is misleading, and they say they've been repeatedly blindsided by changes to the law. For instance, because of budgetary restraints Republicans demanded, insurers haven't received an expected $12 billion from a program meant to help them cover particularly expensive customers. Dozens of insurers are now suing the federal government to recover payments.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to stabilize the current market, what\u2019s your solution?\u201d Udvarhelyi said. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve hung in there losing hundreds of millions of dollars is a testament to the fact that we do care, but we need responsible action on the part of policymakers right now.\"Patrick Conway, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, points out his company would have kept 2018 premiums flat if Trump hadn\u2019t eliminated the cost-sharing subsidy. Instead, the insurer jacked up rates by an average of 13 percent to make up for the lost funding. ", " \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to having the lowest possible premiums for our customers, and market stabilization would help us have the lowest possible premiums,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI\u2019ve been traveling around the state and people are really worried about the cost.\u201dAs insurers start to crunch the numbers on 2019 premiums, they will have to account for uncertainty over congressional funding and recent steps taken by the Trump administration weakening Obamacare. The elimination of the requirement to purchase insurance, which takes effect in 2019, and the administration\u2019s efforts to make it easier to sell cheaper, skinnier plans that don\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements, are likely to further destabilize the markets.The insurers\u2019 biggest concern is fewer healthy individuals will buy Obamacare plans, either going without coverage, since they\u2019ll no longer face a fine next year, or buying a new cheaper plan that covers far less.\u201cThese things will chip away at the market,\u201d S&P\u2019s Banerjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get meaningfully worse, but it doesn\u2019t get any better.\u201dInsurers are warning that they\u2019ll again have to jack up rates in 2019 if Congress doesn\u2019t take action to stabilize the markets. A study from California\u2019s marketplace suggests premium spikes around the country are likely to range from 16 to 30 percent next year. That means many Obamacare customers could be facing sticker shock just weeks before heading to the polls.Polling has consistently shown that Republicans will shoulder most of the blame for future problems in Obamacare, since they\u2019re fully in charge of the federal government. That could spur them to begrudgingly take action to tamp down premium increases, despite their disdain for the health care law. ", " \u201cI think the people in charge, whether it\u2019s fair or not, will probably [get the blame],\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), vice chair of the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee. \u201cEverybody\u2019s prices are going up.

At the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked why Rogers has not been granted additional authority to confront Russian hacking efforts aimed at the U.S. elections. She did not give a precise response.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on looking at a variety of different ways,\u201d Sanders said.She pointed to a State Department announcement of $40 million to support public and private efforts to combat Russian and Chinese propaganda, and a meeting that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held with state, local and federal officials who are \u201cworking on ways that we can best prevent things like this in the future.\u201dAsked why those efforts have not included explicit presidential authority for Rogers to do more, Sanders replied that \u201cnobody is denying him the authority.\u201d ", " \u201cThe president is looking at all of the different causes and all of the different ways that we can prevent it.

Still, everyone gives him shit because he didn't say anything.Trump, on the other hand, has no catch-22.

In 2017, the average amount of ad time an hour on broadcast was a little over 13 minutes, according to Nielsen. On cable it was 16 minutes.For Fox to avoid a steep revenue drop-off, it would likely need to charge a lot more money for the scarce inventory it has left after cutting ad time to two minutes.The shift is contingent on the industry changing the way it buys and sells media. Mr. Marchese wants to sell ads using a metric based on time spent with content, versus the number of views.\u201cThe two minutes per hour is a real target for Fox, and also our challenge for the industry,\u201d said Ed Davis, chief product officer for ad sales at Fox Networks Group, in an email. \u201cCreating a sustainable model for ad-supported storytelling will require us all to move.\u201dMr. Marchese\u2019s 2020 goal was part of his closing remarks. \u201cIt was sort of an aspiration or goal.

EPA office led by Gov. Walker's former aide to decide smog pollution rules>Armed with years of air quality testing and other evidence, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tentatively concluded late last year that most of southeast Wisconsin needs to take more aggressive action to reduce lung-damaging smog.>The decision infuriated Gov. Scott Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate who had wooed Foxconn Technology Group to Racine County a few months earlier with $3 billion in financial incentives, promises to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan water for a sprawling new electronics factory, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the state\u2019s dirtiest air.>Walker and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources blame Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in parts of the state. \u201cWisconsin is not the issue,\u201d a Walker spokeswoman said. But an EPA analysis of industrial pollution, traffic patterns and weather shows Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems.>Within the next three months, the same regional EPA office that prepared the Wisconsin analysis will make a final decision about how much \u2014 or how little \u2014 Foxconn and other companies must do to curb smog-forming pollution. Only now the Chicago-based office is led by Cathy Stepp, a former top aide to Walker who spent the past three years urging EPA officials to exempt Wisconsin from the smog regulations. ", " >>234940fuck off stormfagthat has nothing to do with smogyou insert race into everything like a n complusive obessivesee a shrink ", " >>234942>Walker once said he chose Stepp to lead the Natural Resources Department because she has a \u201cchamber of commerce mentality.\u201d During her six-year tenure at the state agency, Stepp rolled back enforcement of environmental laws, cut funding for scientific research and scrubbed references to human-caused climate change from the department\u2019s website.>She also has been an enthusiastic backer of Walker\u2019s Foxconn incentives, calling the planned liquid crystal display factory a gift to an area she represented as a Republican state lawmaker during the mid-2000s.>Asked by the Tribune if she has a conflict of interest in her new job at the EPA, a spokesman emailed a one-sentence statement announcing that Stepp will recuse herself from any involvement in the Wisconsin smog case after consulting with the agency\u2019s ethics office. Her staff declined to make Stepp available for an interview.>Former top EPA officials from the Obama and George W. Bush administrations welcomed Stepp\u2019s decision. But they still are concerned that the Trump administration will undermine the health-based smog standards as part of a broader attack on clean air and water regulations, noting that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt already has attempted to delay the regulations from taking effect.>\u201cYou might be able to play politics when you represent a state, but when you are at EPA your mission is to protect public health,\u201d said Mary Gade, who played a major role in earlier initiatives to improve Midwest air quality as head of the Chicago EPA office under Bush and the Illinois EPA director in former Republican Gov. Jim Edgar\u2019s administration. ", " >>234945>Janet McCabe, who helped develop the new smog standards as the U.S. EPA\u2019s assistant administrator for air and radiation in the Obama administration, said the smog regulations have withstood several court challenges and are grounded in well-documented medical research.>\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone can justify exempting areas with dirty air,\u201d said McCabe, now an Indiana University law professor and senior fellow at the Chicago-based Environmental Law and Policy Center. \u201cThese areas already have too much pollution, so the idea is you shouldn\u2019t be adding new sources unless you ensure there is an overall decrease in pollution that is protective of public health.\u201d>Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. Breathing even low levels can inflame the lining of the lungs and trigger asthma attacks; long-term exposure can cause heart disease and shave years off of lives.>After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.>Average smog concentrations in all of the Wisconsin areas targeted by the EPA exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to state monitoring data. Smog levels peaked at 83 ppb last year in Racine County and averaged 75 ppb between 2015 and 2017.>To help clean up the air, Foxconn\u2019s new factory and existing sources of smog-forming pollution likely would need to install more effective pollution-control equipment, scale back production or broker emissions-trading agreements with cleaner facilities. ", " >>234948>Walker, who is seeking re-election this year, has urged the Trump administration to reverse the Wisconsin smog designations. If he succeeds, it would amount to another break for Foxconn, a Taiwan-based company that Walker and the Republican-controlled state Legislature already has cleared to dig up environmentally sensitive wetlands and exempted from a thorough study of how the factory\u2019s pollution will affect the surrounding area.>\u201cWe can protect our natural resources and support job creation at the same time,\u201d said Amy Hasenberg, a Walker spokeswoman, citing Foxconn\u2019s promise of thousands of new jobs and the state\u2019s earlier efforts to reduce smog-forming pollution.>Illinois, meanwhile, has said it agrees with the EPA that Chicago and most of the suburbs should remain on the agency\u2019s list of areas with dirty air, which will require the state to expand its smog-fighting efforts. Reducing pollution locally also will aid Wisconsin and other downwind communities, just as required \u201cgood neighbor\u201d efforts in other states help Illinoisans breathe easier.>The EPA already has solicited comments from Wisconsin but gave the state until Wednesday to provide more information in an attempt to sway its final decision. The Wisconsin DNR is still drafting its response, a spokesman said.>Resistance to the smog standards is part of an ongoing battle over the EPA\u2019s authority, with public health experts, environmental groups and a bipartisan group of former agency officials attempting to fight off business interests, Republican politicians and Trump administration officials moving to scrap regulations adopted under laws that once were supported by both major political parties.>Pruitt, Stepp\u2019s new boss, sued to block the smog standards during his previous job as Oklahoma attorney general, enlisting Walker and other Republican governors to join a lawsuit drafted with substantial input from fossil fuel interests. ", " >>234950>Soon after Pruitt took office at the EPA, he moved to delay the standards from taking effect for at least a year. He later backtracked under legal pressure from Illinois and 15 other states with Democratic attorneys general but suggested the agency might try again to extend the deadline for states to comply.>The push to hobble the smog standard and other EPA initiatives, driven largely by groups affiliated with the industrialists Charles and David Koch and other right-wing campaign donors, often relies on common, frequently debunked arguments about the cost of cleaning up the environment.>\u201cBusiness growth in east and southeast Wisconsin will be greatly impacted by this decision,\u201d Lucas Vebber, general counsel and director of environmental and energy policy for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state\u2019s largest business group, told Wisconsin Public Radio last month.>\u201cThe negative stigma ... greatly affects businesses\u2019 decision making when considering choices on where to locate or expand,\u201d Walker wrote in a March 2015 letter to then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy when the agency was finalizing the new smog standards. \u201cWisconsin is especially in jeopardy of harm because of the strong role manufacturing plays in our economy.\u201d>In 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to base air-quality standards on public health concerns, without considering the economic impact. The unanimous opinion, written by the late conservative icon Antonin Scalia, allowed the government to enforce a smog standard of 84 ppb set by the Clinton administration in 1997. ", " >>234952>Health groups note that most of the country met earlier smog standards far more quickly and at significantly lower costs than expected.>Only a handful of counties still exceed the Clinton-era smog standard. None is in Wisconsin.>In 2011, a peer-reviewed EPA study found that reductions in smog and fine particle pollution prevented more than 160,000 early deaths, 130,000 heart attacks and millions of asthma cases nationwide during 2010 alone.>The Obama EPA estimated that most of the nation \u2014 including Wisconsin \u2014 would meet the new smog standard by 2025, with the biggest improvements in air quality coming from cleaner cars, trucks and power plants required by other federal regulations the Trump administration is attempting to unravel.

Gov. Casey Cagle, who leads the Georgia State Senate, demanded Monday that Atlanta-based Delta, one of the state\u2019s largest employers, make a choice: Stop punishing the NRA, or watch Republican lawmakers strike down a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel, of which Delta would be the primary beneficiary.\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted. \u201cCorporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\u201dCagle, who has served as Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2007, could weave the issue into his campaign in Georgia\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial race, in which he is considered the leading GOP contender to replace Gov. Nathan Deal (R).Delta has not commented on the threat from Cagle, who says he is \u201ca lifelong member of the NRA\u201d and boasts that he has earned an A+ rating from the organization every year he has served in elected office. The gun-rights group has also endorsed Cagle in the past.Delta recently joined United Airlines, Best Western, MetLife and at least a dozen other companies in cutting discounts and perks for NRA members amid the national gun-control debate after the deadly Valentine\u2019s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Advocates of the #BoycottNRA movement are now determined to convince tech giants such as Apple, Google, Roku and Amazon to stop streaming NRA-produced videos, though none have announced plans to do so. (Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) "}, "replies": [" The NRA has lashed out at the boycott movement, saying that the companies that dropped the discounts were participating in \u201ca shameful display of political and civic cowardice.\u201d But the group also downplayed the importance of the company actions.\u201cLet it be absolutely clear,\u201d a weekend statement from the NRA said. \u201cThe loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.\u201dPolitical leaders in some blue states have begun competing for Delta\u2019s favor by encouraging the airline to relocate its hub from Atlanta.\u201cHey @delta \u2014 Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You\u2019re welcome here any time,\u201d tweeted Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D).New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul noted that New York \u201cis open for business\u201d and suggested that the airline should move its headquarters to \u201cwhere you\u2019re appreciated.\u201dThe lieutenant governor of Washington, Cyrus Habib, thanked Delta for cutting ties with the NRA and said his state would be a lovely place to do business.The embrace of Delta by leading Democrats was similar to how Republican leaders around the country embraced the NRA after a prominent Dallas politician said he didn\u2019t want the group holding its annual convention there in May. At the time, officials in Kansas and Nebraska invited the NRA to host the spectacle of \u201cmore than 20 acres\u201d of firearms exhibits in their states instead.Delta at first resisted taking a stance, as companies with even the slightest affiliation to the NRA were called out and a list of companies that had cut ties with the NRA began circulating on Twitter. But, as The Washington Post reported, Delta held out against the pressure for only a few hours. ", " A spokesman at first defended Delta\u2019s flight discounts to the NRA\u2019s annual convention in Dallas in May as routine for large groups. The airline has more than 2,000 such contracts in place,\u201d a spokesman told the liberal outlet ThinkProgress on Friday night.Come Saturday morning, though, Delta abruptly discontinued the discounts and asked the NRA to remove the information about the perk from the convention website.United Airlines released a nearly identical statement two hours later.Although Delta ended its alliance with the NRA, the company said its position on the gun-control debate remains neutral. \u201cOut of respect for our customers and employees on both sides, Delta has taken this action to refrain from entering this debate and focus on its business. Delta continues to support the 2nd Amendment,\u201d the airline said in a statement Saturday.Cagle soon issued a statement of his own, saying that \u201cdiscriminating against law-abiding gun owners will not solve the problem.\u201dThe statement didn\u2019t mention Delta specifically but called on \u201ccorporate America\u201d to \u201cdonate a portion of its profits to mental health treatments and school safety initiatives. They should put their money where their mouth is instead of engaging in viewpoint discrimination against conservatives and law-abiding gun owners.\u201dBut on Monday, Cagle set his sights on Delta, which says it\u2019s Georgia\u2019s No. 1 private employer, with 33,000 employees across the state.Many conservatives cheered Cagle\u2019s threat. But Walter Shaub, the former director of the federal Office of Government Ethics, slammed the Georgia lawmaker on Twitter, writing: \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided you represent an association headquartered just outside Washington DC instead of the people of Georgia, including those who work for Delta? At least you\u2019re honest about the fact that you don\u2019t care about your job or your people.\u201d ", " It\u2019s unusual for the Georgia\u2019s Republican leaders to oppose tax breaks for a major corporation \u2014 especially when that tax break could provide an economic boost, said Chuck Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia.\u201cThere was some debate over the tax break,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the justification was that it would bring more jobs to the state. That\u2019s what you usually hear from Republicans.\u201dBullock said Cagle\u2019s remarks may have been made with the upcoming gubernatorial primary in mind, as his bold show of commitment to the Second Amendment will likely play well with core Republican voters.But he also said it\u2019s likely that Republican state leaders\u2019 threats aren\u2019t empty ones. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the bill, which was easily approved in the House on Thursday, fails in the Senate, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not like [Delta] can pack up and move somewhere else. This is their major hub,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what might be a bigger concern is that other corporations view this negatively. Ones that aren\u2019t already anchored in Atlanta.\u201dOther Georgia Republicans have joined Cagle. State Sen. Rick Jaffares (R) promised to lead the charge to kill the bill \u201cto let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable.\u201dAnother conservative state senator, Michael Williams, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Republicans in the Senate want to reject the proposed tax break. \u201cWhen Delta came out and pretty much dumped on all the NRA members, it invigorated a lot of our base,\u201d Williams said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight.\u201dUntil Delta\u2019s announcement, the bill seemed to have wide support, as advocates say it would attract flights to Atlanta as opposed to other major airports, where jet fuel taxes are not charged. ", " During an earnings call last month, Delta officials said the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allowed the company to take a one-time charge of $150 million in the fourth quarter because of the new inclusion of foreign earnings and the reevaluation of deferred tax assets. In 2018, the company expects a reduced corporate tax rate will result in an all-in book tax rate of 22 percent to 24 percent.But the company expects to pay taxes in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 which is when Georgia\u2019s proposed tax bill would be especially beneficial, particularly in helping fund pensions, Delta officials said.I guess there are times the 'Fre' market doesn't work and there are such things as bad tax breaks for corporations for Republicans.

Mr. Trump nominated Jim Bridenstine, an Oklahoma congressman, to be the next administrator, but the Senate has not yet confirmed him. Whether the administration has the votes to confirm him remains uncertain.

Since it removed soda from the Happy Meal menu four years ago, orders for it with Happy Meals have fallen 14 percent, the company said. Hamburgers and Chicken McNuggets will remain the main entrees on the Happy Meal menu.The Happy Meal, which has been around for nearly 40 years, has long been a target of health advocates and parents who link it to childhood obesity. McDonald\u2019s has made many tweaks over the years, including cutting the size of its fries and adding fruit. Most recently, it swapped out its apple juice for one that has less sugar.It\u2019s been especially important as the company tries to shake its junk-food image, since McDonald\u2019s is known for getting more business from families with children relative to its traditional rivals, such as Burger King and Wendy\u2019s. McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t say how much revenue it makes from the $3 Happy Meal, but the company said 30 percent of all visits come from families.McDonald\u2019s will make the changes, including new nutritional standards for the Happy Meal changes, by June in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a good step in the right direction,\u201d said Margo Wootan, the vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWe would love to see many more restaurants do the same.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s said Thursday that it wants all its Happy Meal options to have 600 calories or fewer and have less than 650 milligrams of sodium. http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/mcdonald-s-slims-down-happy-meal-by-banishing-cheeseburgers/article_96a6237b-7433-5d0f-9d22-e4269f7c0f77.html "}, "replies": [" It also wants less than 10 percent of the meal\u2019s calories to come from saturated fat and the same percentage to come from added sugar.The cheeseburger and chocolate milk didn\u2019t meet those new standards, the company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said. It is, however, working to cut sugar from the chocolate milk and believes it\u2019ll be back on the Happy Meal menu eventually \u2014 but doesn\u2019t know when that will happen.Trudy Munk, a mother of three from Lombard, Ill., who was at a McDonald\u2019s with her 3-year-old niece on Thursday, said she wasn\u2019t sure if the changes would make much of a difference.\u201cI just feel like if you are coming to McDonald\u2019s, you\u2019re not necessarily looking for the healthiest option,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it as a treat and I don\u2019t mind getting my kids french fries or the cheeseburgers.\u201dThere will be other tweaks: The six-piece chicken nugget Happy Meal will now come with a kids-sized fries instead of a small, lowering calories and sodium from the fries by half. And bottled water will be added as an option to the Happy Meal menu, but will cost extra. Currently, the Happy Meal menu lists milk, chocolate milk and apple juice. Soda does not cost extra.For international restaurants, McDonald\u2019s Corp. said that at least half of the Happy Meal options available must meet its new nutritional guidelines. The company said some are adding new menu items to comply, like in Italy, where a grilled chicken sandwich was added to the Happy Meal menu.In September 2017, Panera Bread CEO Ron Shaich challenged fast-food executives, including those from McDonald\u2019s, to eat for a week the kids\u2019 meals they sell.Sunset Hills-based Panera also challenged fast-food companies in an ad campaign in August 2016 to provide healthier options for kids.

James Green, director of NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division, wrote her back.\u201cI agree with you that Pluto is really cool \u2014 in fact, who would have believed that Pluto has a heart? ... It\u2019s a fascinating world that appears to be constantly changing.

She asked questions that I couldn\u2019t answer,\u201d said Sarah O\u2019Donovan, who taught Cara last year at Glasheen Girls\u2019 School in Cork, Ireland. \u201cShe\u2019s always interested in things that are far, far above her level.\u201dCara said she\u2019s been interested in space and astronomy since last year. She loves learning about \u201cthe forming of the planets,\u201d she said.Her interest was piqued even more after listening to songs and watching videos about Pluto. So one day, she asked O\u2019Donovan to help her write a letter to NASA. Cara had not learned much yet about reading and writing, so her teacher wrote her words for her. As Cara talked almost non-stop, O\u2019Donovan typed, at times interrupting Cara so she could Google some of the bits of information the little girl was giving her to make sure they\u2019re accurate (They were, she said).The letter was written and sent to NASA headquarters last April. O\u2019Donovan said they also wrote to the European Space Agency after they did not receive a response from NASA. NASA wrote back months later. The correspondence caught the attention of Irish media this week.\u201cI was happy,\u201d Cara, who wrote the letter when she was 5, told The Washington Post this week. \u201cI was jumping up and down.\u201dGreen said he receives several letters every month, and he always answers them. Most recently, he said, he signed off on a letter to a young boy from Turkey who was quite concerned about the possible existence of another planet deep in the solar system. Another boy wrote NASA about his interest in applying for a job as a planetary protection officer, defending Earth from biological contaminants. ", " Sometimes, Green said, he receives drawings and paintings.\u201cIt\u2019s really a delight for me,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s a break in my day when I open up a letter like that and have an opportunity to see where these kids are at and spend time to actually answer their question.\u201dCara, in particular, impressed Green with her knowledge about the Kuiper belt.\u201cShe got that. She understood that,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt was really exciting, these kids that really want to dig in and understand our solar system. I get really excited about it.\u201dCarly Howett, a Colorado-based scientist involved in NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission to explore Pluto, also wrote a letter to Cara after finding out about the girl from an astronomy magazine in Ireland.\u201cI felt that that could\u2019ve been me when I was her age. Reaching out and not really expecting much,\u201d said Howett, who grew up in a small town in the United Kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s important that that dream of hers, that spark not be extinguished.\u201d\u201cI kind of hope that this story shows that scientists don\u2019t have to be unreachable, that we\u2019re people,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you have a question, you reach out to whoever it is, whether it\u2019s Neil deGrasse Tyson or someone else. That\u2019s how curiosity starts.\u201dThe International Astronomical Union, not NASA, downgraded Pluto\u2019s status to that of a dwarf planet because it failed to meet all criteria needed to be classified as a full-sized planet. Pluto met two: It orbits around the sun, and it has sufficient mass to assume a nearly round shape. But it failed to meet the third, which says it needs to have \u201ccleared the neighbourhood\u201d around its orbit. This means there should be no other bodies that are comparable in size in a planet\u2019s vicinity in space.Cara is far from alone in her desire to restore Pluto\u2019s status as a planet. Last year, a group of NASA scientists proposed expanding the definition of a planet. ", " The scientists suggested that \u201cround objects in space that are smaller than stars,\u201d should be considered planets, USA Today reported.Coming to America and becoming a NASA astronaut may sound like distant dream for a girl from southern Ireland, but Green, of NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division, said Cara needs only to look at someone who had already done so.Nicola Fox, who was born and raised in a small town outside of London, is now a scientist for NASA and Johns Hopkins University. Like Cara, Green said, Fox started as a little girl whose bedtime stories were about the moon landing.\u201cShe\u2019s been here in the country for about 20 years. That started just like Cara does in terms of dreaming and thinking about this field,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that my letter was just a little tug in that direction.\u201d ", " this isnt news. couldnt you find any biased fuck drumpf articles to waste your time posting?

That's in contrast to a Thursday interview with the House intelligence committee, where Bannon declined to answer some of lawmakers' questions, despite a subpoena.>While the exact questions for Bannon are unknown, Mueller is investigating whether there was any coordination between Trump's campaign and Russians who meddled in the 2016 election, and also whether there have been any efforts to obstruct the ongoing FBI probe into those contacts. The House panel is investigating the meddling and whether Trump's campaign was involved.>Because Bannon was one of Trump's top advisers, both Mueller and the lawmakers were expected to question him about key events during his time in the White House, including Trump's firings of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI Director James Comey.>After Bannon's roughly three-hour interview on Capitol Hill, Republicans on the House intelligence panel were weighing whether to hold him in contempt. Like his first visit to the House intelligence committee in January, Bannon declined to answer questions in the closed-door session.>According to lawmakers of both parties, Bannon would only answer 25 questions that had been pre-approved by the White House when asked about any events in the time period after President Donald Trump's election. His answer to each question was \"no\" and he told the committee he was not authorized to elaborate. "}, "replies": [" >Bannon was already under subpoena as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been critical of the White House's sweeping interpretation of executive privilege and its contention that pretty much everything is off limits until the president says it's not.>The escalating fight between Congress and the White House over the privilege issue has centered around Bannon, an outsized figure in President Donald Trump's campaign and White House and an inspiration to some conservatives as he has publicly battled the Republican establishment. He was fired from the White House last summer, and more recently had a falling out with Trump after the January publication of a book in which he sharply criticized Trump family members.>Despite his fractured relationship with Trump, Bannon has followed White House direction as the House lawmakers have sought to talk to him. At issue is whether Bannon can talk about the presidential transition, his time at the White House and communications with Trump and others since he left last summer.>Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the panel's Russia probe, said Bannon would only answer the pre-approved questions about any time period past the day Trump was elected in November 2016. He said committee Republicans would discuss whether to hold Bannon in contempt with House lawyers and with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is likely to have the final say.>\"That's an ongoing conversation we'll have among an awful lot of lawyers,\" Conaway said after Bannon's interview.>At least one Republican on the intelligence panel said before the interview that a contempt vote would be necessary if Bannon were uncooperative. Florida Rep. Tom Rooney said Tuesday that if Bannon didn't cooperate with the panel and they didn't hold him in contempt, that would set a bad precedent.>\"For not just our committee but every committee, that (subpoenas) don't mean anything, that it's just a hollow threat,\" Rooney said. \"You can't do that.\" ", " >Democrats are pushing for a contempt vote, with the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, saying he believed Bannon's non-answers were all an attempt to draw out and block the Russia probe.>\"That's not how privilege works, that's how stonewalling works,\" Schiff said. \"And we cannot take that kind of stonewalling for an answer.\">Negotiations between the House and White House have been ongoing since Bannon's first interview, and several interviews have been scheduled and postponed in recent weeks. Lawmakers headed into the meeting ahead of Bannon's entrance appeared unsure if he would arrive.>Bannon is one of the committee's few remaining witnesses in its Russia probe, which Republicans on the panel have said they want to wrap up early this year.>The Senate intelligence committee is running a separate investigation into the Russian meddling. The Senate panel hasn't yet spoken to Bannon, according to a source familiar with the probe. The person declined to be named because the interview schedule isn't public.

", " >>230708Two different interrogations. Read it all again but slowly this time.>>230721I expect Mueller was more persuasive simply by being more informed. He presumably has the most comprehensive knowledge about this of anyone. ", " >>230713The house committee is a joke. Nearly everyone (Republican and Democrat) is just looking to grandstand. Bannon, on behalf of the Trump administration, basically told them to go fuck themselves by refusing to answer questions (Bannon isn't legally able to hide behind executive privilege). The committee is mulling over holding him in contempt, which actually has some teeth, but that will probably take months of legal battles. If Bannon/Trump just want to throw a wrench in the investigation (which they probably do), this is the perfect way to do it.Meanwhile, we don't really know what happened in the Mueller interview. I'd imagine he was much more cooperative, just on the basis that Mueller has a lifetime of squeezing peoples' balls in order to get information out of them. Bannon seems to have kept his hands clean of the Russian mess, I don't see why he wouldn't sing like a bird the moment he's threatened with a subpoena.

With club names such as Tigger Army and Neverland Mermaids, how threatening can they be?\u201cIt\u2019s all about the shared love for Disney,\u201d said Mark Drop, Jr., 39, who founded a club called Flynn\u2019s Riders, after a character in the Walt Disney animated film \u201cTangled.\u201dBut a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court has revealed a dark undercurrent to the pastime. The head of one club has accused another of using gangster-like tactics to try to collect \u201cprotection\u201d money for a charity fundraiser at the park.The lawsuit reads like a mob movie set in a theme park. The plot revolves around the Main Street Fire Station 55 Social Club, whose leaders claim they have been bullied and terrorized by the head of the White Rabbits Social Club.The lawsuit names 19 members of the White Rabbits, accusing them of defamation, invasion of privacy, conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It asks the court to reward the victims compensatory and punitive damages, to be determined during the trial.The suit also names Disneyland, saying the park has failed to take action against the offending club. A park spokeswoman said Disney has not been served with the lawsuit and declined to comment further.Some longtime Disneyland fans who are not involved with the clubs say the idea of adults forming clubs to show their love for the park is a bit strange but not dangerous.http://www.pressdemocrat.com/entertainment/7977597-181/disneyland-social-club-likened-to "}, "replies": [" \u201cI\u2019m not sure what Walt would think of big groups in matching biker vests walking down Main Street, but it\u2019s not the most outrageous thing I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Matthew Gottula, a 28-year-old marketing worker from Altadena who visits the park frequently.Social clubs began forming at the Anaheim parks in earnest in 2013, according to longtime club members, who say they can\u2019t remember who or what triggered the trend.The park hosts about 100 clubs, ranging from five or six members to more than 100. Most members are adults, who own annual passes and meet at the park at least once a month.The clubs\u2019 common traits are their denim vests, adorned on the back with the Disney character that the club is named for and Disney trading pins on the front.The vests are made to resemble those worn by motorcycle gangs. The Hells Angels and Mongols add the initials \u201cMC\u201d on their vests, for motorcycle club. The Disneyland clubs add \u201cSC\u201d on the vests, for social club.\u201cWe just go to the park and socialize and ride the rides but we wear vests,\u201d said Bill Oliver, 49, a service technician from Downey who started the Nightmare Crew social club three years ago. The club members are fans of Tim Burton\u2019s movie \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas.\u201dEach club has its own rules for accepting new members. Some clubs take a vote on new members while others have a probation period, during which the prospective member can wear a vest but cannot wear the club\u2019s patch. That\u2019s another tradition of motorcycle gangs.Drop, the founder of Flynn\u2019s Riders, said he has drafted a constitution for his club. It spells out that a prospective member must go through a three-month evaluation period before the club\u2019s council members vote on admission. ", " A favorite club activity is called a \u201cride takeover,\u201d in which members try to fill every vehicle of an attraction, said Roxy Tart, who founded the Bangerang Babes in 2014, a club of Tinkerbell fans whose members adorn themselves with glitter and sequins during park visits.On a recent Sunday afternoon, several members of the Jack O\u2019 Lanterns Social Club took over a vehicle on the Golden Zephyr swing ride at Disney California Adventure. As the silver spaceship vehicles swung around in a lazy circle, the Jack O\u2019Lanterns waved their hands in the air like gleeful kids.Club members count it as a small victory if they get enough members to fill every boat in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland or all the seats in Soarin\u2019 Around the World at California Adventure Park.\u201cIt\u2019s as if you had fans of the same band or of the (NFL) Raiders,\u201d Tart said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big group of people with something in common that they love.\u201dClub members acknowledge that they may look intimidating to other park guests as they walk in packs through the parks, dressed in gang-like regalia.Drop, who wears a goatee and dark sunglasses, concedes that he might resemble a \u201cgangster cholo guy.\u201d But members say they try to be friendly in the park and explain to other guests that they have nothing to fear.\u201cWe are grown-ups but we act like children in the parks,\u201d said Oliver of the Nightmare Crew.Members say the clubs don\u2019t feud with each other. When one club crosses paths with another in the park, they usually stop to chat or exchange trading pins.\u201cMostly when we see another club, we just wave,\u201d said Michelle Mallek, 27, a teacher from Los Angeles and member of the White Rabbits Social Club, named for the rabbit most recently seen in the 2010 Tim Burton movie \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201dOutside the parks, the clubs unite for barbecues or birthday parties at their private homes. Some members get together to organize fundraisers for homeless shelters or children\u2019s hospitals. ", " That is where the problems arose between the Main Street Fire Station 55 Social Club, named for the fire station at Disneyland, and the White Rabbits, one of the largest clubs in the park.John and Leslee Sarno, the founders of the Main Street Fire Station 55 club, claim in the lawsuit that they planned a memorial walk and fundraiser for Sept. 11, 2016, at Disneyland to benefit the families of the firefighters killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.A week before the event, the lawsuit claims that John Sarno was approached by Jakob Fite, the head of the White Rabbits Social Club. Fite was backed by four of his fellow club members and the men demanded $500 to \u201cprotect\u201d the event participants, the suit claimed. If Sarno did not pay, Fite and his White Rabbits would make sure Sarno would never get into the park again, the lawsuit said.Sarno refused to pay and claimed in the lawsuit that Fite and his allies have since spread malicious rumors about him on social media sites visited by Disneyland social clubs and on a podcast hosted by Fite.The suit also contends that Fite distributed Sarno\u2019s medical information to \u201cunauthorized users,\u201d in violation of federal privacy laws. The lawsuit names Kaiser Foundation Health Plan as a defendant, claiming the medical insurance company failed to protect Sarno\u2019s medical information.Kaiser issued a statement, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the lawsuit and can\u2019t comment due to the pending litigation.\u201dFite, 42, a sound engineer from Apple Valley, rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, saying Sarno filed the suit to fire back at him for raising questions about Sarno\u2019s character among other Disneyland social clubs.Fite co-hosts a podcast that discusses Disney\u2019s subculture and said he used that forum to raise questions about Sarno\u2019s character and suggest that Sarno has been misleading club members about his background to raise money for charitable causes. ", " Through their attorney, John and Leslee Sarno declined to comment on the lawsuit.In an email, the Sarnos\u2019 attorney, Patricia Kramer, said the couple \u201chave no desire to further publicize their circumstances or to take any action that could be construed as their own re-publication of the false and defamatory statements that have been circulated by the defendants in this case.\u201dOther social club members say the dispute between Sarno and Fite does not reflect the behavior and attitude of most clubs at the park.

If the proposed rule takes effect, even more restaurant owners would feel they have a blank check to siphon tips away.>So, why is the Trump administration skirting the law and dodging the numbers?>It\u2019s especially puzzling given that Secretary Acosta has written eloquently on the need to follow the law and established procedures when repealing regulations. Likewise, the head of the White House agency that reviewed this rule, OIRA Administrator Neomi Rao, expressly testified at her Senate confirmation hearing that this kind of cost-benefit analysis is important even in deregulatory actions.>If we take them at their word, Secretary Acosta and Administrator Rao have no choice but to withdraw this proposal and reissue it\u2014if at all\u2014with a good-faith economic analysis.

The results could ripple across the economy, hurting families and local businesses and placing new demands on social service programs.>The implications of this potential rule change are too great to ignore, either within the administration or among workers and consumers.>Restaurant customers shouldn\u2019t allow the Trump administration to make them complicit in stealing from their servers to pad the pockets of the owners. This proposal can\u2019t go into effect until the public has a chance to comment on it.>Before the next time you go out to dinner, please take a minute to tell Secretary Acosta, Administrator Rao and President Trump: I want my tips to go to the person who worked hard to serve me, not to the restaurant owner.

But the server who wants to keep their job, or wants some percentage of tips, cannot announce it to their customers or to the entire restaurant (you can see this in action when Gordon Ramsay tells patrons this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsJCrvkJgZYSo the regulation would help protect consumers as well as servers.

This could result in more pay equity between cooks and server, as right now when you go to restaurant's, the person bringing the food to your table makes twice as much as the person making your food.Next, in non small towns, this allows people without training to become waiters, waiters and bartenders can be the highest paid positions within a restaurant. This allows people to become waiters directly at lower class restaurant, without having to get irrelevant experience as a busboy for a set period of time. They can work at a crappier place that will give them experience and then transfer to a better restaurant.Finally, this plays into the role of tipping, if tipping gives you better service and that service is important to customers then the restaurant where waiters have no tips will have poorer quality service and people will avoid it.

And it can be corrected and we can correct it fast when we have people with the right thinking.\u201dDemocrats seized on the updated deficit to demand Trump follow through on his promises to restrict steel and aluminum imports and get tough with China.\u201cThe best way to reset our trade relationship with China is to address its relentless cheating of our trade laws,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \"He can start by taking action on the steel [investigation].\"Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who heads a group of House Democrats calling for big changes to trade deals, urged Trump to negotiate labor provisions in a new NAFTA deal \"that increase wages in Mexico so that we can begin to stop the international race to the bottom.\u201d\"Unlike President Trump, the facts do not lie,\" DeLauro said. \"The trade deficit has not been this wide since the [George W.] Bush administration.\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/06/trump-trade-disaster-325749 "}, "replies": [" Most economists, however, dispute that trade deficits are a sign of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as then-candidate Trump put it. Trade deficits tend to rise when times are good because businesses and consumers have more money to spend. Some of that spending is on goods and services produced in the United States and some is on goods and services from overseas. The last big drop was in 2009, when the United States plunged into the Great Recession and both imports and exports fell sharply.Still, by Trump\u2019s own litmus test, he not only failed to solve the problem, he arguably made it worse by signing a massive tax bill expected to add at least $1 trillion to the U.S. budget deficit over the next 10 years. That will require the United States to borrow more money from abroad, which has the effect of pushing the trade deficit higher, said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\u201cI think your story should be titled 'the trade deficit is growing and that\u2019s a good thing,'\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the George Mason University Mercatus Center, a free market think tank. \u201cThere is no relation between the trade deficit and industrial decline or success.\"While the trade deficit expanded during Trump\u2019s first year in office, for instance, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in 17 years as employers hired more than 2 million additional workers. The U.S. economy picked up steam, helping to push the stock market 25 percent higher, although it has fallen in recent days on inflation fears.\u201cWhen you look in detail at the trade deficit, not only are imports going up, exports are going up. It\u2019s just the fact that the United States is growing at a slightly faster pace than Europe and Japan at this point, or its primary trade partners in Canada and Mexico,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a financial advisory firm aimed at mid-sized companies. \u201cThis is a win-win for everyone.\u201d ", " Both sides of the trade deficit debate agree that Trump did nothing in 2017 that can be seen as helping to reduce the trade deficit. While he recently announced tariffs on solar products and washing machines, those items account for a tiny fraction of overall U.S. imports, which totaled more than $2.8 trillion last year.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of irons in the fire and some of the things that they are proposing are good ideas\u201d that could help balance trade, said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cBut if you look at ... the laws and policies in force, they are the same as they were a year ago and not surprisingly, you have the same kind of results that Trump attacked as a candidate.\u201dThose irons include two Commerce Department investigations that could lead to tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from around the world to protect U.S. national security \u2014 a rarely-used justification that could be copied by other countries to the detriment of U.S. exports.\u201cThe trade deficit ultimately will be reduced through a combination of enforcement actions, renegotiation of some existing agreements and negotiation of new agreements,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in statement that walked back Trump's campaign promise to eliminate the trade deficit in one or two years. \u201cStrenuous effort is underway, but it is not practical to set an exact deadline.\u201d ", " The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is also conducting a separate probe that could lead to restrictions on Chinese imports in retaliation for Chinese policies and practices that force American firms to transfer valuable technology.\u201cI have very serious concerns about the long-term ramifications of justifying protectionism under the guise of national security,\u201d said Clark Packard, trade policy counsel at the R Street Institute, a public policy research group that promotes free markets and limited government. \u201cIf your goal was to completely unravel the international trade system, I think natural security would be the string you would pull because countries are given such wide latitude to restrict imports in the name of security.\u201dThere\u2019s more justification for the USTR probe aimed solely at China's forced technology and intellectual property practices, but \u201cany attempt by the Trump administration to cut the trade deficit using trade policy would be a mistake. Imposing tariffs is going to be a drag on the economy and you\u2019d see retaliation against American exports, potentially ensnaring unrelated industries,\u201d Packard said.So, what could Trump actually do to reduce the trade deficit if going at it through trade policy is a dead end?\u201cYou have to rewrite the tax code to reduce incentives for consumption and increase incentives for Americans to save,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cGoing at it through trade policy \u2014 it\u2019s not only clumsy, it\u2019s just not going to work.\u201d ", " Gotta love how this is being ignored.

Adam Schiff came before a planned meeting of the House intelligence panel Monday, where the committee is expected to consider whether to release a Democratic rebuttal memo. Democrats are seeking to push back on the Republican document, which questions the FBI methods used to apply for a surveillance warrant on a onetime Trump campaign associate.On Twitter, Trump called Schiff \u201cone of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington,\u201d adding that he \u201cmust be stopped.\u201dSchiff quickly shot back: \u201cInstead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or ... really anything else.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/960513046438449152Trump also praised Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., on Twitter, calling him a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!\u201dThe committee did not release the Democratic memo last week, with one Republican member saying revisions were needed so the memo would not endanger national security. Key Democrats are seeking to put out the document, including the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, who urged Trump to back the public release and said that refusing to do so would show the president\u2019s intent to undermine the Russia investigation. "}, "replies": [" Trump would need to sign off on the memo if it contains classified information. A White House official said Monday that if the Democratic memo made it out of the committee, the administration would consider releasing it, subjecting it to a similar review process as the Republican memo. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and sought anonymity to discuss internal thinking.House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he supports the release of the Democrats\u2019 memo, if sensitive intelligence information is removed.Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as well as whether there have been efforts to obstruct the investigation.Trump tweeted over the weekend that the memo \u201ctotally vindicates \u2018Trump\u2019 in probe\u201d even as \u201cthe Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on.\u201d But that statement found no echo from four committee Republicans who appeared on the Sunday talk shows. Lawmakers also said the memo should not impede Mueller.\u201cI think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the special counsel shouldn\u2019t complete his work. I support his work. I want him to finish it. I hope he finishes it as quickly as possible,\u201d said Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah.Schiff has branded the GOP memo \u201ca political hit job\u201d and has questioned whether Nunes had coordinated with the White House in drafting the document seized on by the president to vent his grievances against the nation\u2019s premier law enforcement agencies.\u201cThe goal here is to undermine the FBI, discredit the FBI, discredit the Mueller investigation, do the president\u2019s bidding,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very possible his staff worked with the White House.\u201d ", " Nunes was asked during a Jan. 29 committee meeting whether he had coordinated the memo with the White House. \u201cAs far as I know, no,\u201d he responded, then refused to answer when asked whether his staff members had communicated with the White House. He had previously apologized for sharing with the White House secret intelligence intercepts related to an investigation of Russian election interference before talking to committee members.The memo released Friday alleges misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his ties to Russia. Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI\u2019s use of information from former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier containing allegations of ties between Trump, his associates and Russia.The underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the GOP memo. Even as Democrats described it as inaccurate, some Republicans quickly cited the memo \u2014 released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department \u2014 in their arguments that Mueller\u2019s investigation is politically tainted.The memo\u2019s central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page\u2019s communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI\u2019s suspicion received funding from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer. ", " Steele\u2019s research, according to the memo, \u201cformed an essential part\u201d of the warrant application. But it\u2019s unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated.Republicans say a judge should have known that \u201cpolitical actors\u201d were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power \u2014 an accusation he has consistently denied.The memo confirms the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was \u201ctriggered\u201d by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI.The confirmation about Papadopoulos is \u201cthe most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo,\u201d Schiff said Saturday.

Nunes was caught holding water for Trump in the past as well when he was caught lying about Obama wire tapping him and he White House had Nunes come there to get some papers which Nunes then claimed he brought to the White House.

I shouldn't have to pay more only because our workers demand more pay for the same work.>After all, we shouldn't take pressure off our manufacturers with subsidies so they don't produce internationally competitive products.If we want our solar manufacturing to be more competitive, subsidies are a great way to accomplish that because they reduce the price of buying our technology (or more generally increase the quality/cost function) relative to what other countries have on offer.In any case, there are lots of reasons to subsidize one product or tax its alternative. For example, when a consumer is choosing what to purchase they don't typically take a macroeconomic perspective. So in the context of choosing energy companies for example you can have scientists and economists estimate the longer term opportunity cost in environmental degradation of using a unit of electricity produced with a dirty fuel, so the natural response in an intelligent society would be to build that cost into the price of the product paid upfront. The consumer is then responsible for the cost of what he uses on everyone else. However, applying tariffs to force consumers to purchase inferior or more expensive domestically made products is arbitrary. What is the point of making everyone pay more to benefit some workers? There's an opportunity cost to every American and it's not clear what the justification is other than to shrink solar's share of the energy market in the US in comparison to fossil fuel industries that lobby the GOP and promises Trump made to coal businesses.

Subsidies will lower the price of what we make not just to us, but will also increase demand abroad for our products.>>223821If China wants to spends its government's money on making its products more competitive that's not inherently bad at all.

It doesn't need sheltering, we should definitely subsidize solar to make it a more attractive alternative to non-renewables, but otherwise if China or other countries are selling the same or better product for cheaper then we should generally buy more from them and invest where we have a comparative advantage.

Whether you see the cost of the tax on the bill or it gets hidden in your yearly taxes, you still pay it. You could argue that we can shuffle money into it from another program, but we still are paying for it.At the end of the day, a tarriff or subsidy does the exact same thing with regards to propping up domestic products unable to compete on the world stage.

Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, according to four people told of the matter, but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.>The West Wing confrontation marks the first time Mr. Trump is known to have tried to fire the special counsel. Mr. Mueller learned about the episode in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.>Amid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation, two of the people said.>First, he claimed that a dispute years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., had prompted Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director at the time, to resign his membership. The president also said Mr. Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Finally, the president said, Mr. Mueller had been interviewed to return as the F.B.I. director the day before he was appointed special counsel in May.>After receiving the president\u2019s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation. "}, "replies": [" >Mr. McGahn disagreed with the president\u2019s case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that Mr. Trump would not follow through on the dismissal on his own. The president then backed off.>Ty Cobb, who manages the White House\u2019s relationship with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, said in a statement, \u201cWe decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.\u201d>Mr. McGahn, a longtime Republican campaign finance lawyer in Washington who served on the Federal Election Commission, was the top lawyer on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. He has been involved in nearly every key decision Mr. Trump has made \u2014 like the firing of the former F.B.I. director \u2014 that is being scrutinized by Mr. Mueller.>Mr. McGahn was also concerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation.>Around the time Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Mueller, the president\u2019s legal team, led then by his longtime personal lawyer in New York, Marc E. Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president\u2019s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors had donated to Democrats.>Mr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions. But for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, it reinforced the idea that, although Mr. Mueller is a Republican, he had assembled a team of Democrats to take down the president. ", " >Another option that Mr. Trump considered in discussions with his advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, and elevating the department\u2019s No. 3 official, Rachel Brand, to oversee Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.>Mr. Trump has significantly ratcheted back his criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb for his legal team in July. A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies, Mr. Cobb has known Mr. Mueller for decades, dating to their early careers in the Justice Department.>He advised Mr. Trump that he had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller, a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb\u2019s arrival, the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, not to fight him.>Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has wavered for months about whether he wants to fire Mr. Mueller, whose job security is an omnipresent concern among the president\u2019s legal team and close aides. The president\u2019s lawyers, including Mr. Cobb, have tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him for months, amid new revelations about the inquiry, that it is close to ending.>Mr. Trump has long demonstrated a preoccupation with those who have overseen the Russia investigation. In March, after Mr. McGahn failed to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the inquiry, Mr. Trump complained that he needed someone loyal to oversee the Justice Department.>The former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Mr. Trump asked him for loyalty and encouraged him to drop an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Comey said he sidestepped those requests. He was soon fired. ", " >In an interview with The New York Times in the Oval Office in July, the president pointedly kept open the option of firing Mr. Mueller, saying that the special counsel would be passing a red line if his investigation expanded to look at Mr. Trump\u2019s finances. Mr. Trump said he never would have made Mr. Sessions the attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself from the investigation.>Last month, as Republicans were increasing their attacks on the special counsel, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that he believed Mr. Mueller was going to treat him fairly.>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me because I hope that he\u2019s going to be fair,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response to a question about whether it bothered him that Mr. Mueller had not yet ended his investigation. \u201cI think that he\u2019s going to be fair.\u201d>Mr. Trump added: \u201cThere\u2019s been no collusion.

A group that tracks Russian-linked social media influence campaigns says the volume of Russian-related #ReleaseTheMemo traffic represents the most coordinated such effort since their website launched in early August.>\"I've never seen any single hashtag that has had this amount of activity behind it,\" said Bret Schafer, an analyst who helps runs the Hamilton 68 dashboard , a project with the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. It tracks about 600 accounts that it says are tied to Russian-sponsored influence and disinformation campaigns; most of those accounts were promoting the same meme Friday.WHAT IS THE MEMO?>The underlying #ReleaseTheMemo drama started Thursday after Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, revealed a brief report produced by Republican staff dealing with Trump's wiretapping allegations. The report stems from a lengthy investigation House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes conducted into the alleged surveillance of Trump transition aides and the revealing of names - or \"unmasking\" - of Trump aides in classified reports.>Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted on party lines - over Democratic member objections - early Thursday to make the brief, 3-page report available to members of Congress.

The website WikiLeaks was an early big promoter of #ReleaseTheMemo, and it received attention Thursday night from conservative personalities including the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Republican U.S. Rep. Steve King.

His goal: get entities like Facebook and Google to pay money to publishers, effectively in exchange for the value news outlets bring to those platforms.Citing the popularization of \u201cscurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable,\u201d Murdoch says Facebook and Google should pay money in an arrangement similar to so-called carriage fees. These fees are the money paid by cable and satellite television providers to local, over-the-air broadcast stations for the right to carry local transmissions. In the US, this is an industry norm, with the fees being baked into what\u2019s known as retransmission consent. That arrived back in 1992 in an agreement that became legally mandated between cable operators and stations with the United States Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act.\u201cIf Facebook wants to recognize \u2018trusted\u2019 publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,\u201d Murdoch writes. \u201cThe publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content, but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook\u2019s profits but a major impact on the prospects for publishers and journalists.\u201dhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/1/22/16920254/news-corp-rupert-murdoch-carriage-fee-facebook-google-journalism-media "}, "replies": [" Murdoch has a point that Facebook and Google, which control a lion\u2019s share of the online advertising business, now have an outsize stake in the journalism business, all while dodging classification as media companies. Google has remained relatively quiet about the issue, though it\u2019s addressed structural failures in its search engine and other ad-supported product related to Russian propaganda and weathered significant controversy lately over YouTube\u2019s questionable role in the media ecosystem.The topic is a particularly thorny for Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg took much of 2017 to come to terms with his company\u2019s influential role in the spread of misinformation, the mental and emotional well-being of its user base, and the functioning of Western democracies. Recently, Facebook said it would alter the News Feed algorithm to favor posts between friends and family over news sources that may seek to game its algorithm, while the company announced plans last week to survey users about news sources\u2019 reliability to help weed out those bad actors. Just earlier today, Facebook acknowledged further that its impact on democracy may be a net negative. ", " Still, Murdoch calling for a carriage fee arrangement between tech and media companies is particularly unprecedented. European regulators, whose more aggressive stance on antitrust has put Silicon Valley in its crosshairs, have been calling for similar arrangements between Google in the EU, given Google News\u2019 impact on newspapers in countries like Spain with struggling news businesses. If anything, Murdoch\u2019s stance here signals a new fracture in what was once seen as a symbiotic relationship between a news media that largely hands its content out for free and the social media ecosystem that has profited handsomely from its dominance of the ad business. It\u2019s also what may be the first monumental step toward a call for Silicon Valley to subsidize the news business, a rather radical but increasingly more attractive option for struggling publishers that see the tech industry as more of a corporate leech with purely financial motives, rather a liberating force for the spread of information.Here\u2019s Murdoch\u2019s full statement:>Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable. Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically.>There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook\u2019s strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms.

Comey was fired, is at the center of much of the political jockeying surrounding the investigation into potential coordination between Trump associates and the Kremlin. He has for months been the subject of Trump\u2019s ire, prompting angry tweets suggesting that the Russia probe is politically motivated by Democrats sore about losing the election.>McCabe, who has spent more than two decades at the bureau, found the conversation with Trump \u201cdisturbing,\u201d said one former U.S. official. Inside the FBI, officials familiar with the exchange expressed frustration that a civil servant \u2014 even a very senior agent in the No.2 position \u2014 would be asked how he voted and criticized for his wife\u2019s political leanings by the president. "}, "replies": [" >One person said the Trump-McCabe conversation is of interest to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.>The encounter is also the latest example of Trump erupting at a senior official, whether it is at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe or White House counsel Donald McGahn for not doing more to quash the investigation early on.>The White House and the FBI declined to comment.>The Oval Office meeting happened shortly after Trump fired Comey following failed efforts by the president to get the FBI director to back off from the Russia probe. Before the May9 dismissal, Trump had also sought a loyalty oath from Comey and was annoyed that the FBI director would not state publicly at the time that Trump was not personally under investigation.>One White House official said Trump expressed his concerns to McCabe about his politics but consented to his becoming acting FBI director on the advice of others and because \u201cthere were no immediate better choices.\u201d Although the job had fallen to McCabe by default, Trump could have picked a different acting director. The Justice Department interviewed four people other than McCabe for the post.>McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill McCabe, received nearly $500,000 in donations from a political action committee controlled by then-Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton who chaired Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful 2008 run for president.>At the time of the donations, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Washington field office, and he recused himself from investigations involving Virginia political figures. A lawyer by training who specialized in counterterrorism work, McCabe became Comey\u2019s deputy in February 2016, by which time the election his wife lost had been over for three months. ", " >But critics have questioned why he went on to oversee two critical cases related to Clinton \u2014 a probe into her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and an investigation into donations made to the Clinton Foundation. At the end of October 2016, as the election neared and the FBI faced intense public scrutiny over McCabe\u2019s role, he recused himself from the Clinton probes.>McCabe\u2019s conduct is now the subject of an investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, and a report is expected in the spring.>Trump had a second meeting with McCabe in the Oval Office to interview him for the position of FBI director. That meeting was brief, as it was clear Trump had no intention of giving McCabe the job, said the first White House official.>A year into his presidency, it is clear Trump still harbors a deep dislike of McCabe. Another White House official said Trump frequently complained about the FBI official, labeling him a Democrat. Over the past seven months or so, Trump has tweeted criticisms of McCabe, erroneously saying McCabe headed the Clinton investigation while his wife was taking Clinton money for her state Senate campaign.>When The Washington Post reported in December that McCabe planned to retire from the FBI in March once he becomes fully eligible for his pension, the president quickly tweeted a fresh criticism of McCabe, again citing the campaign donations to his wife.>In August, a former Justice Department senior official, Christopher A. Wray, became FBI director. In recent months, he has been under increasing political pressure to remove top officials linked to Comey.>Sessions has pressed Wray to replace McCabe, as well as James A. Baker, until recently was the general counsel. It is customary for a new director to bring in his own team. The political controversy surrounding Comey and those of his leadership team who remain at the bureau has increased the pressure on Wray. ", " >Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia who is acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, has been selected to be the FBI\u2019s next general counsel, according to people familiar with the matter. He replaces Baker, who was reassigned late last year.>Boente is a veteran federal prosecutor who has led U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices around the country and has risen to prominence in a variety of acting roles in the Trump administration. When Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates over her refusal to defend his travel ban, Boente took over and said he would defend the measure.>When Sessions was sworn in as attorney general, Boente became the deputy attorney general and, after that, the acting head of the national security division.>Wray also will replace his chief of staff, James Rybicki, with Zachary J. Harmon, a colleague from the law firm where Wray was a partner before joining the bureau. Harmon is a former federal prosecutor who heads the anticorruption practice at King & Spalding.>Harmon also worked in the deputy attorney general\u2019s office in the administration of George W. Bush and helped the FBI rebound from the Robert Hanssen spy scandal. Hanssen, an FBI agent, was accused of leaking secrets to Russia over 22 years until his arrest in 2001.>Asked whether there needs to be a staff shake-up at the FBI, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday, \u201cWe have 100 percent confidence in Director Wray. If anybody will make that decision, it\u2019s the director. We\u2019ll leave that in his hands.\u201d ", " >>222059Holy shit what a dope.Donny you're out of your element!

GPUs are consistently out of stock in all major retailers on a global scale and graphics card prices have seen a two to three fold increase over original MSRPs.NVIDIA Tells Miners To Take A Hike, Wants Its Cards To Land In The Hands Of GamersThe company wants its cards to go to gamers instead and it\u2019s trying to do so by directly selling on its website and asking its retail partners to limit orders to two cards per person. When asked to comment, NVIDIA provided the following statement to ComputerBase.deBoris B\u00f6hles \u2013 NVIDIA ( Translated from German to English )\u201cFor NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience. To ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers\u2019 needs as usual. \u201cNVIDIA states that retailers have the freedom to follow or ignore its recommendations and that it can\u2019t directly intervene in how they choose to run their businesses. This is where direct-selling by NVIDIA on its website plays a key role. The company can implement all the measures it sees fit to make sure that at least graphics cards sold directly by it, go to gamers instead of miners.GPUs Are Money Printing Machines And Miners Are Taking Full AdvantageBitcoin is the gold standard that the entire cryptocurrency market follows, when it soars the entire market goes up and when it goes down the entire market goes down in flames with it. Despite the recent drop in cryptocurrency prices, Bitcoin today is worth more than ten fold what it was worth 12 months ago.https://wccftech.com/nvidia-instructs-retailers-stop-selling-miners-sell-gamers/amp/ "}, "replies": [" The exponential growth that ASIC resistent cryptocurrencies saw over the past year such as Ethereum have made GPU mining an incredibly lucrative business, even after the most recent market correction. When it comes to the blockchain each currency is finite and mining the next coin in the chain is more computationally challenging than the last. The expression time is money has never been more true in this sense.The order limits that NVIDIA has recommended and many retailers have implemented can help stave off huge orders from customers running big cryptocurrency mining operations. The kind of people that are so desperate to get as many cards as possible in as short amount of time as possible to the point where they\u2019re renting entire Boeing 747s to ship GPUs to their mining farms.Why Prioritize Gamers If Miners Are Willing To Pay More?At the end of the day business is just business, so why does NVIDIA want its cards to go to gamers when miners are more than happy to gobble up every last GPU in existence and are more than willing to pay a premium for it? Well, it\u2019s more complicated than that. Miners have no loyalty. To them a GPU is a just a tool, a means to an end.History has shown us what happens when the cyrpto market crashes, or mining suddenly becomes less profitable. Miners end up dumping all of their hardware in the gray market for pennies on the dollar and gamers end up picking these used cards instead of taking their business to the GPU manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD.The sudden surge of hundreds of thousands of cards in the used market reeks havoc on the market and instead of a severe supply shortage the balance tips to a huge surplus. To the point where the GPU manufacturer is unable to sell their inventory and in some cases have to write it off at a huge loss. This is something AMD had to do back in 2014 after the crypto market crashed and used Radeon GPUs flooded the second hand market. ", " Gamers Are More Valuable CustomersMore importantly, from a business perspective, a gamer is a more valuable customer than a miner. If you win a gamer\u2019s loyalty they\u2019re more likely to buy again from you come upgrade time, or purchase other products from you in the long run. Gaming market share is also a huge bargaining chip when it comes to game optimizations and studio partnership negotiations. As a company, you can get away with more if you have a bigger user-base, that\u2019s just the nature of the beast.This is why what NVIDIA is doing is really important for its business, whether it\u2019s going to be successful in dropping prices down to levels of sanity or improve GPU supply remains to be a question that only time will answer. But if we\u2019ve learned anything about retailers is that the only thing they care about is their bottom line, and selling to miners at a premium is simply better for their bottom line.

Its flagship pledge is to \"leave the environment in a better state than we found it\" -- including forests, seas, rivers, soil, animals and plants.Reducing carbon emissions is a central part of the plan: left unchecked, climate change will unravel much of the good work done in other areas. You can create as many marine protected areas as you like -- but their GPS-defined boundaries are no barrier to warmer and more acidic water.close dialog "}, "replies": [" >>218797The logic of the Prime Minister's argument would seem to be inescapable. Whether you appreciate nature by admiring its beauty or by using it for hunting -- I happen to like both -- nature's survival is not something on which we can rely. As with a marriage, keeping it alive takes work.Previous American presidents of the political right appreciated this. Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Marine Mammal Protection Act. George Bush signed a treaty known as the UN climate change convention.All of these measures were perfectly in tune with the views of conservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton that \"there is no political cause more amenable to the conservative vision than that of the environment, for it touches on the three foundational ideas of our movement: trans-generational loyalty, the priority of the local and the search for home.\" ", " >>218799However, while the local should indeed be a priority, merely looking after the local will not do. One reason is that many important issues are global in nature, from the threat to trans-oceanic whales in the 1970s to climate change now. Therefore, global thinking must be part of the solution.A second reason is that business, in a world of free trade, has global supply chains. And though the idea of reducing trade and seeking self-sufficiency was raised both in President Trump's election campaign and in the UK's discussions about life post-Brexit, climate change implies a greater future need for free trade, with violently changing weather taking a toll on commodities such as fish, coffee and wine.And Mrs May laid out the third reason in her speech: \"Climate change and the deterioration of natural environments are prime drivers of poverty, food insecurity and instability, and can trigger conflict and migration.\" Which neatly extends the thoughts of US Defense Secretary James Mattis: \"If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition.\"Mr Trump is, of course, a right-wing leader like no other. Definitely not an inhabitant of the great tradition that gave us Presidents such as Reagan and the two Bushes. But it is right to give him the credit of wanting to do what is the best for his people. So let us look at who is right on climate change, the Paris Agreement, and the economy.The United Nations climate change convention is 25 years old. In the quarter of a century since President George Bush went to the Rio Earth Summit and signed the convention, all of the G7 nations have grown their economies. Most of them have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, too. ", " >>218800The best-performing nation on growth is also, notably, the best at cutting emissions.And it is... the UK. In that period, the average Briton has grown 45% wealthier, while reducing his/her carbon footprint by 33%. The USA has not done badly, coming mid-table on both measures. But the overall conclusion is obvious: there is no conflict between making your people richer and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, from the evidence, one could well draw the opposite conclusion -- a consistent goal and a systematic plan for cutting carbon emissions helps your economy grow faster.The key figure in starting all this was another Conservative figure for whom I hope the President would have some regard: Margaret Thatcher. And it has brought no threat to energy security, or to jobs.The evidence, therefore, is entirely against the world view of Donald Trump and entirely consistent with that of Theresa May.My grandfather, Sir Winston Churchill, knew a thing or two about courage. President Trump is, I gather, a fan, having a bust of him in the Oval Office. Without Churchill's determination, the Nazis would have won the war in Europe.

Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming ... \">A study published last year in the journal WIRES Climate Change, however, lays out how the warming Arctic and melting ice appear to be linked to cold weather being driven farther south.>\"Very recent research does suggest that persistent winter cold spells (as well as the western drought, heatwaves, prolonged storminess) are related to rapid Arctic warming, which is, in turn, caused mainly by human-caused climate change,\" Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and one of the study's authors, said in an email.>\"'Persistent' is the key word here, as overall we expect that record-breaking cold events will occur less often in the future but they will likely last longer,\" she wrote.>Normally, cold air already sits above the North Pole in a swirling area of low pressure known as the polar vortex, which itself is not caused by global warming or climate change, meteorologists say.

The U.S. is proposing in NAFTA talks to blow up that system, but the Canadians argue the U.S. still has a leg up.In a letter last year sent to the governors of New York and Wisconsin, the Canadian ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, cited data showing dairy trade between the countries benefits the U.S. by a five-to-one margin. Agriculture, including dairy, has been one of the main focuses of several rounds of NAFTA negotiations.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Trump was updated Thursday on the status of NAFTA talks, and he\u2019s \u201cvery pleased on where things are going.\u201d Mnuchin said, \u201cwe are expecting that will be re-negotiated or we will pull out.\u201dTrump also this week repeated his claims that the U.S. \u201chas been treated very, very badly\u201d under NAFTA, citing trade deficits with Canada and Mexico. He said he\u2019s willing to be \u201cflexible\u201d but wants a fair deal, which he described as a \u201cTrump deal.\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t make the right deal, I will terminate NAFTA.

That's just the mathematical laws of weather. Laypeople won't understand it unless you have 30 minutes of audio-visual lecture time to illustrate chaos and computer models and statistics in space and time and such, so somehow a scientist, if appearing as an expert source on TV news say, has to strike a balance between being technically accurate, communicating such that the audience gets an accurate understanding, and conveying the key point, the latter of which may be ridiculously complex if broken down scientifically and statistically.In this case the key point is that climate models predict certain types of local extremes as a companion effect of Gobal Warming, many of which are due to changes in air or water currents, and this then can manifest as an increased likelihood of extreme large-scale weather events, including high-intensity hurricanes and air fronts.

The Earth's field has alternated between periods of normal polarity, in which the predominant direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and reverse polarity, in which it was the opposite. These periods are called chrons.The time spans of chrons are randomly distributed with most being between 0.1 and 1 million years[citation needed] with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals are estimated to take between 1,000 and 10,000 years.

The fact that their past antics don't make you question whats going on makes me think you're either retarded or you work for Project Veritas.But just to humor you, lets talk about the shadowban claim. Abhinav Vadrevu worked for Twitter as an intern and software engineer two years ago. In his interview he says \"I don't know if Twitter does this anymore,\" implying they did this in the past. Here's an article from about a year ago in which Fortune talked to Twitter about it's \"shadowbans.\" http://fortune.com/2017/02/16/twitter-time-out/In it, Twitter admits to limiting the reach of your tweets in a sort of \"Twitter time out\" where only your followers can see what you tweet. Each time that's done, you are notified of your limited tweeting ability and the amount of time that it will take to be restored to full status. After that period of time, your tweets go back online. Shadowbans are different, in that you don't know that you're banned from everyone else seeing your content.Twitter has also admitted to using a filter to group low quality or harassing posts into a category that a user then has to click on to expand to see them all.Both of these tactics are public knowledge and have been for awhile, but the reality is that neither of them are shadowbans, but a restriction on the outreach of a tweet. So for the shadowban claim, what's so shocking about what they reported when they were scooped a year ago? ", " >>217229What proof to Trump's sexual assault? This is literally someone admitting they committed a crime. You're right, Twitter should be investigated immediately ", " >>217230Veritas reports have led to the stepping down and firing of alot of people out of shame.

Wynn Jr., in a biting 191-page opinion, said that Republicans in North Carolina\u2019s Legislature had been \u201cmotivated by invidious partisan intent\u201d as they carried out their obligation in 2016 to divide the state into 13 congressional districts, 10 of which are held by Republicans. The result, Judge Wynn wrote, violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.The ruling and its chief demand \u2014 that the Republican-dominated Legislature create a new landscape of congressional districts by Jan. 24 \u2014 infused new turmoil into the political chaos that has in recent years enveloped North Carolina. President Trump carried North Carolina in 2016, but the state elected a Democrat as its governor on the same day and in 2008 supported President Barack Obama.The unusually blunt decision by the panel could lend momentum to two other challenges on gerrymandering that are already before the Supreme Court \u2014 and that the North Carolina case could join if Republicans make good on their vow to appeal Tuesday\u2019s ruling.In October, the court heard an appeal of another three-judge panel\u2019s ruling that Republicans had unconstitutionally gerrymandered Wisconsin\u2019s State Assembly in an attempt to relegate Democrats to a permanent minority. In the second case, the justices will hear arguments by Maryland Republicans that the Democratic-controlled Legislature redrew House districts to flip a Republican-held seat to Democratic control.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html "}, "replies": [" The Supreme Court has struggled without success for decades to develop a legal standard for determining when a partisan gerrymander crosses constitutional lines. The court once came close to ruling that such cases were political matters beyond its jurisdiction. But the rise of extreme partisan gerrymanders in the last decade, powered by a growing ideological divide and powerful map-drawing software, has brought the question back to the justices with new urgency. A Supreme Court ruling outlawing at least some such gerrymanders could reshape the political landscape.Fights over voting rights and election procedures have often taken center stage in Raleigh, North Carolina\u2019s capital, and Tuesday\u2019s ruling noted that \u201cpartisan advantage\u201d had been a criterion lawmakers used when mulling how to map the state.Republican officials in the General Assembly said Tuesday evening that they intended to appeal the ruling, which many elected officials and political strategists were still scrambling to digest. Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, criticized Judge Wynn and accused him of \u201cwaging a personal, partisan war on North Carolina Republicans.\u201dIn a separate post on Twitter, Mr. Woodhouse argued that Judge Wynn had concluded that North Carolina\u2019s Republicans \u201cshould not be allowed to draw election districts under any circumstances under any set of rules,\u201d an effort he called \u201ca hostile takeover\u201d of the General Assembly and legislatures nationwide. Republicans could ask the Supreme Court to stay the decision and allow the disputed map to be used this year.But critics of the congressional map welcomed a decision that was notable for its tartness and urgency. ", " \u201cClearly, the courts have realized that they do need to step in and police extreme partisan gerrymanders, and the court recognized that North Carolina\u2019s gerrymander was one of the most extreme in history,\u201d said Ruth Greenwood, senior legal counsel at the Campaign Legal Center and a lawyer representing some of the map\u2019s challengers.The chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, Wayne Goodwin, said the decision was \u201ca major victory for North Carolina and people across the state whose voices were silenced by Republicans\u2019 unconstitutional attempts to rig the system to their partisan advantage.\u201dThe judges issued their decision fewer than 24 hours before the General Assembly was to convene in Raleigh for a special session. The ruling unmistakably placed lawmakers on the clock, giving them two weeks to present a \u201cremedial plan\u201d and declaring that the court would institute its own map if it finds the new district lines unsatisfactory.\u201cPolitically, this gives hope to Democrats,\u201d said J. Michael Bitzer, a professor of political science at Catawba College, which is near Charlotte. \u201cI can imagine the Republicans being furious, but they have to see political reality, and it\u2019s not just in the next two weeks: It\u2019s come November.\u201dProfessor Bitzer, though, cautioned that the ultimate political fallout would not become clearer until the courts settled what could be a cascade of appeals and injunctions.The ruling left little doubt about how the judges assessed the Legislature\u2019s most recent map. Judge Wynn, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and was a member of a special panel considering the congressional map, said that \u201ca wealth of evidence proves the General Assembly\u2019s intent to \u2018subordinate\u2019 the interests of non-Republican voters and \u2018entrench\u2019 Republican domination of the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\u201d ", " Most federal lawsuits are first heard by a district court, and later \u2014 if needed \u2014 by an appeals court and the Supreme Court. But under federal law, constitutional challenges to the apportionment of House districts or statewide legislative bodies are automatically heard by three-judge panels, and appeals are taken directly to the Supreme Court.In addition to Judge Wynn, an appointee of Mr. Obama\u2019s, Senior Judge W. Earl Britt of the Federal District Court in Raleigh joined the opinion. Judge Britt was appointed by President Jimmy Carter.Judge William L. Osteen Jr., who was appointed by President George W. Bush and sits on the federal bench in Greensboro, said he agreed that the existing map violated the 14th Amendment, but he disputed other parts of Judge Wynn\u2019s opinion, including the decision to appoint an independent expert to begin preparing an alternative map.

A patch exists but causes performance drops, particularly in virtual machines.https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/whats-behind-the-intel-design-flaw-forcing-numerous-patches/What\u2019s behind the Intel design flaw forcing numerous patches?There's obviously a big problem, but we don't know exactly what.Both Windows and Linux are receiving significant security updates that can, in the worst case, cause performance to drop by half, to defend against a problem that as yet hasn't been fully disclosed.Patches to the Linux kernel have been trickling in over the past few weeks. Microsoft has been testing the Windows updates in the Insider program since November, and it is expected to put the alterations into mainstream Windows builds on Patch Tuesday next week. Microsoft's Azure has scheduled maintenance next week, and Amazon's AWS is scheduled for maintenance on Friday\u2014presumably related.Since the Linux patches first came to light, a clearer picture of what seems to be wrong has emerged. While Linux and Windows differ in many regards, the basic elements of how these two operating systems\u2014and indeed, every other x86 operating system such as FreeBSD and macOS\u2014handle system memory is the same, because these parts of the operating system are so tightly coupled to the capabilities of the processor. "}, "replies": [" >>215050(...)Here's what we do know. Every modern processor performs a certain amount of speculative execution. For example, given some instructions that add two numbers and then store the result in memory, a processor might speculatively do the addition before ascertaining whether the destination in memory is actually accessible and writeable. In the common case, where the location is writeable, the processor managed to save some time, as it did the arithmetic in parallel with figuring out what the destination in memory was. If it discovers that the location isn't accessible\u2014for example, a program trying to write to an address that has no mapping and no physical location at all\u2014then it will generate an exception and the speculative execution is wasted.Intel processors, specifically\u2014though not AMD ones\u2014allow speculative execution of ring 3 code that writes to ring 0 memory. The processors do properly block the write, but the speculative execution minutely disturbs the processor state, because certain data will be loaded into cache and the TLB in order to ascertain whether the write should be allowed. This in turn means that some operations will be a few cycles quicker, or a few cycles slower, depending on whether their data is still in cache or not. As well as this, Intel's processors have special features, such as the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) introduced with Skylake processors, that slightly change how attempts to access memory are handled. Again, the processor does still protect ring 0 memory from ring 3 programs, but again, its caches and other internal state are changed, creating measurable differences. ", " >>215051What we don't know, yet, is just how much kernel memory information can be leaked to user programs or how easily that leaking can occur. And which Intel processors are affected? Again it's not entirely clear, but indications are that every Intel chip with speculative execution (which is all the mainstream processors introduced since the Pentium Pro, from 1995) can leak information this way.The first wind of this problem came from researchers from Graz Technical University in Austria. The information leakage they discovered was enough to undermine kernel mode Address Space Layout Randomization (kernel ASLR, or KASLR). ASLR is something of a last-ditch effort to prevent the exploitation of buffer overflows. With ASLR, programs and their data are placed at random memory addresses, which makes it a little harder for attackers to exploit security flaws. KASLR applies that same randomization to the kernel so that the kernel's data (including page tables) and code are randomly located.The Graz researchers developed KAISER, a set of Linux kernel patches to defend against the problem.If the problem were just that it enabled the derandomization of ASLR, this probably wouldn't be a huge disaster. ASLR is a nice protection, but it's known to be imperfect. It's meant to be a hurdle for attackers, not an impenetrable barrier. The industry reaction\u2014a fairly major change to both Windows and Linux, developed with some secrecy\u2014suggests that it's not just ASLR that's defeated and that a more general ability to leak information from the kernel has been developed. Indeed, researchers have started to tweet that they're able to leak and read arbitrary kernel data. Another possibility is that the flaw can be used to escape out of a virtual machine and compromise a hypervisor. ", " >>215052The solution that both the Windows and Linux developers have picked is substantially the same, and derived from that KAISER work: the kernel page table entries are no longer shared with each process. In Linux, this is called Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI).With the patches, the memory address is still split in two; it's just the kernel half is almost empty. It's not quite empty, because a few kernel pieces need to be mapped permanently, whether the processor is running in ring 3 or ring 0, but it's close to empty. This means that even if a malicious user program tries to probe kernel memory and leak information, it will fail\u2014there's simply nothing to leak. The real kernel page tables are only used when the kernel itself is running.This undermines the very reason for the split address space in the first place. The TLB now needs to clear out any entries related to the real kernel page tables every time it switches to a user program, putting an end to the performance saving that splitting enabled.The impact of this will vary depending on the workload. Every time a program makes a call into the kernel\u2014to read from disk, to send data to the network, to open a file, and so on\u2014that call will be a little more expensive, since it will force the TLB to be flushed and the real kernel page table to be loaded. Programs that don't use the kernel much might see a hit of perhaps 2-3 percent\u2014there's still some overhead because the kernel always has to run occasionally, to handle things like multitasking. ", " >>215053But workloads that call into the kernel a ton will see much greater performance drop off. In a benchmark, a program that does virtually nothing other than call into the kernel saw its performance drop by about 50 percent; in other words, each call into the kernel took twice as long with the patch than it did without. Benchmarks that use Linux's loopback networking also see a big hit, such as 17 percent in this Postgres benchmark. Real database workloads using real networking should see lower impact, because with real networks, the overhead of calling into the kernel tends to be dominated by the overhead of using the actual network.While Intel systems are the ones known to have the defect, they may not be the only ones affected. Some platforms, such as SPARC and IBM's S390, are immune to the problem, as their processor memory management doesn't need the split address space and shared kernel page tables; operating systems on those platforms have always isolated their kernel page tables from user mode ones. But others, such as ARM, may not be so lucky; comparable patches for ARM Linux are under development. ", " So if I have an AMD chip then I'm good, right? ", " >>215106Short answer is no, nearly every chip shares this flaw because of how sophisticated this sort of attack is. The upside is a fix will come down well before anyone will have a script kiddy level exploit ready. The downside is that in the pursuit of performance someone forgot about the basic use of branch prediction implementation and now we are all going to lose performance for it ", " This has hit Intel's stock price hard. Many unseen ramifications from this. ", " Google already found a (cheap enough) compiler-side fix for spectre, so it's just a matter of recompiling every fucking thing (ib4 gentoo supreme master race kek) to remove the branch prediction exploit, and recent intel cpus can also manage the kernel isolation required to deal with meltdown with very low perf impact.Impressive overoptimisation exploit but ultimately won't achieve much. ", " >>215106You are safe from the meltdown exploit but not specter. ", " >>215150The best part is, Intel knew about the flaw and the CEO waited to release info about it until after he had sold 24 million bucks worth of stock off. ", " >>215143Incorrect.There are multiple flaws. The Intel exclusive flaw (meltdown) is the most dangerous. The other one (spectre) affects all processors but it is much harder to actually exploit. ", " >>216028Let me give the long answer. Its been a few days so we could read over their work and see the early ramifications so it will be closer to correct. Yes, meltdown is exclusive to Intel. The fix however is only available by patches to the OS on your box. These patches, written to your disk, do not care if you have AMD, Intel, or ARM if youre a wierdo. Because these patches are specific to Intel it has done an okay job for fixing the Intel issues outright. AMD got the short end of the stick here because AMD uses a different branch prediction method from Intel. As an example, AMD processors in a meltdown patched windows 7 box will BSOD on certain common antivirus instruction calls because the fix was not tested outside Intel architectures before being pushed out. Initial googling and checking the usual hives of cyberscum and villainy tells me that this attack is still in Academic PoC-land so you have time before really needing to update your rig. Unless you operate a large scale cloud based webservice or regularly use one you will not notice the first drop in performance. When we see the price of amazon, google and other cloud based services go up next week it will be blamed on the Net Neutrality repeal but its really because Spectre and Spectre 2: the Haunting will require patches that destroy any prediction based branching involving access to the disk (thats a lot of the branching operations). When it comes to normal home computing like vidya and streaming its not going to have a big impact unless you are seeking that bleeding edge gentoo levels of performance.For future reference this posts date is before all information came out, just the observations of someone in the field who is literally paid to read up on this for RA purposes.

The measure is retroactive from Jan. 1 this year, the ministry said.The move would \u201cpromote the growth of foreign investment, improve the quality of foreign investment and encourage overseas investors to continuously expand their investment in China,\u201d the ministry said. It did not elaborate.Despite its appeal as a manufacturing hub, one where companies from around the world have set up operations to tap into a highly skilled work force and strong infrastructure, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher than it is in many other countries.The newly approved tax incentives in the United States could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China\u2019s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or those that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere. And officials in Beijing have worried that the overhaul could prove to be a challenge to Chinese laws that aim to keep money from leaving the country\u2019s borders. "}, "replies": [" But ministers, officials and analysts in much of the rest of the world have said it could create an uneven playing field and set off a race among countries to cut corporate taxes. Because the United States already offers a large and wealthy domestic market, relatively light workplace regulation and large amounts of venture capital, lower tax rates had been one lever that other countries had used in an effort to lure companies.Asian and European officials have speculated that some of the measures in the revamped tax code could help encourage United States companies produce goods domestically for exporting. European leaders, for their part, have raised the specter of a trade battle and implied they may challenge the overhaul before the World Trade Organization.China, meanwhile, has had its own concerns.Many American and European companies have complained in recent years that the country is becoming an increasingly difficult place to do business. Firms say they have had to navigate tricky new laws, been subject to forced technology transfers, and have complained that the authorities curtail their access to Chinese consumers. ", " China sets tight rules on how much money flows out of the country, as a way of controlling the value of its currency and keeping its financial system stable. A significant repatriation of foreign earnings could set off a broader capital flight, and weaken the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi. And a sharp fall in the renminbi could spark a vicious cycle with even more companies \u2014 and possibly individuals \u2014 looking to minimize losses by moving their money out of China.The currency controls, which were tightened last year as Beijing tried to stem a tide of money leaving the country, have led to complaints from foreign companies doing business there.It is, for the moment, unclear how much money American companies actually keep in China, or how much they would seek to bring home. Many businesses use complex accounting techniques to book profits overseas, and firms with major investment plans in China could elect to keep their money here regardless.Regardless, business lobbying groups here said it was unlikely that the Chinese government\u2019s latest measures would be significant enough to keep many American companies from repatriating profits.Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said some of his member companies had already said that they would seek to repatriate China earnings to the United States with the tax code change, and were considering doing so quickly to minimize the risk of being subject to capital controls.\u201cSome are concerned that China may impose foreign exchange controls if these repatriations mount up and lead to capital outflow pressures, like we saw early this year and last year,\u201d Mr. Parker said.

By 2002 it had fallen to less than 12 percent. NAFTA hurt Mexican wages, rather than reducing the differential. In the 20 years after NAFTA went into effect, the buying power of the Mexican minimum wage dropped by 24 percent.>The World Bank in 2005 found that the extreme rural poverty rate of 35 percent in 1992-94, prior to NAFTA taking effect, jumped to 55 percent in 1996-98, after NAFTA was in place. By 2010, 53 million Mexicans were living in poverty, about 20 percent in extreme poverty, almost all in rural areas.Wow! We managed to increase rural poverty in Mexico by about 60%! I can't imagine that having any knock on effect on illegal immigration or the influence of cartels! But its OK because we traded stable, generational, middle class manufacturing jobs in Michigan and Ontario to have Jos\u00e9 work for less than half our minimum wage to do the same work.

It works to circumvent a century of labor laws, environmental regulation and that's bad. We export our environmental problems while creating a trade deficit. Its a lose lose for the working classes of all countries involved and the only class of people that benefit are a coalition of rootless cosmopolitan venture capitalists that gamble on other peoples work.
