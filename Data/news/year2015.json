"}, "replies": [" >>12742This is really good news. Basically, yellow cake is \"raw\" uranium that takes months to turn into the enriched stuff they sent to Russia. While still classified as LEU, some of what they had was enriched to a higher grade than necessary for fuel use, indicating that it was likely intended for possible weapons use in the future. That's now gone.Also importantly, this was one of the terms of the deal that some experts worried Iran would refuse to comply with.More Jewish sources:http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran/US-hails-Iran-shipment-of-low-enriched-uranium-stockpile-to-Russia-438767http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/world/middleeast/iran-hands-over-stockpile-of-enriched-uranium-to-russia.html ", " >>12742I've been extremely surprised how well the Iranians have managed to accomplish their goals. Not only did the sanctions get lifted, they still have the ability to develop nuclear weapons within a short amount of time. That's basically having a soft nuclear deterrent on you.Take that along with the massive amount of influence they've been developing in Iraq (not sure how much they've gained in Syria), and Iran is sitting mighty happy as far as middle eastern geopolitics is concerned. ", " >>12781Thanks Obama. ", " >>12781I doubt they could produce a nuclear weapon with relative ease like everybody expects. At least, a usable one. That shit's hard, and expensive. Still, the fact that everybody acts like they can makes it effective in scaring people like having the actual ability would. ", " >>12742We might as well trust them if we're fighting ISIS along side them in Iraq for the time being. ", " >>12856You could actually with the material they have.But it wouldn't be a conventional nuclear weapon as the nuclear material would not be part of the chain reaction that creates the explosion but rather to 'salt' a conventional weapon with adding radiation. This is known as a \"dirty bomb\".Both the US and UK government believe it is very likely that this with happen before the end of this century. ", " Good. Watch Israel suddenly become very well behaved. Gee, no more atrocities against Palestine? Wonder why.

Not many are going to die from the explosion it's the fall out that's going to get you. And frankly with all the missing yellow cake from when the USSR fell chances are if a dirty bomb goes off it won't be because of Iran. ", " >>13015Iran's supreme leader said \" Israel won't exists in 25 years\" wouldn't put it past them to indeed be suicidal.

Is this just propaganda? ", " >>13131Iran's government is pretty schizophrenic.Of the top of my head, this article is a pretty good showcase of how all-over-the-place its policies can be:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Iran#Islamic_Republic_.28since_1979.29(You can also see the obvious bias and poor English in places, so do check sources and take a grain of salt before accepting anything written there as fact) ", " >>12890Bush and Cheney's advisers actually advised them against invading Iran because of their large conventional military that could have easily waged guerrilla warfare across the country which itself is pretty huge.Militarily invading Iran would be the worst decision ever and would have bankrupted our country alot more then Iraq+Afghanistan and we would have seen tens of thousands of causalities in the first few months.The US can't make Iran their puppet and there isn't any reason why we should anyway. Iran are the good guys of the middle east for the most part. Our allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the cause of most of the regions problems.>>13111He didn't mean that in terms of Israel being nuked or whatever, he just meant that in 25 years there won't be a Jewish-state called \"Israel\" located in Palestine, essentially he was just implying there will be an arab state or a multi-ethnic and pluralist one there instead of a state that favors jews over arabs ", " >>13111Except if Iran were suicidal, we'd probably be suspecting a lot more clandestine support for jihadists than we actually do. Iran's policies have all been towards state-building, with who they fund outside of their nation, to how they develop within it. Even if the Ayatollah went nuts, there's enough state-building interests within that nation that it wouldn't last. ", " >>13131They need to seem really anti-West, so the religious leaders provide that rhetoric, while state organs operate in compliance. This way, they keep much of the more still revolutionary minded populace that they've built, satisfied that the government is indeed representing the interests of the 1979 revolution, while actually doing things necessary to build a functioning nation with the ability to project power. Support for the revolution still has quite a lot of strong supporters, despite even very conservative leaders (e.g. Ahmedinejad) making motions to weaken the Ayatollah's power in government. ", " >>12880>before the end of this centuryA lot of things can happen before the end of this century... ", " >>13164But Iran has voiced their hate for Israel on multiple occasions. And correct me if I'm wrong, do they not support Hezbollah (spelling) a major terror organization in the region? Saying they're the good guys if the Middle East may be a bit extraneous. ", " So a nuclear Iran isn't a threat? ", " >>12742No, but they're a problem for Saudi Arabia and Israel, not us. Honestly the Islamic world annihilating itself in a nuclear war would be the best of all possible outcomes. ", " >>13273Israel is our ally. A problem for them is a problem for us B ", " >>13265Iran's leaders and most of its citizens are vocal in their disdain for the Israeli government but they still make it clear that they just don't like the government and its policies and its not that they don't like Jews, Iran has a large Jewish population and Iran's leaders are very respectful of Judaism and any Jews who aren't linked to the Israeli government.They do support Hezbollah but its a large stretch to call Hezbollah terrorists, Hezbollah does not intentionally target civilians unprovoked like Al-Qaeda, they only launching rockets at civilian Israeli areas during the war as reprisals when Israel would drop tons of bombs on Lebanese civilians ares where Hezbollah wasn't operating. Hezbollah has been accused of involvment in the Marine Corps bombing and in the bombing of the Argentinian embassy but if you look past what the MSM will tell you about those the evidence for Hezbollah's involvement in those is actually really thin. Hezbollah also legitimately and legally participates in Lebanon's politics and hold seats in their parliament and treats civilians of all religions and ethnic groups fairly and never targets them except in retaliation during war like I mentioned so its not really fitting to call them \"Terrorist\" like we called Al-Qaeda. Right now Iran has 20 times more then the US to fight ISIS because Iranian soldiers are on the ground fighting them now and have been for a long time. Iran also does not generally support groups that target America (like Al-Qaeda). Virtually all of the terrorist groups that threaten the US are funding mostly by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait.Unlike Saudi Arabia or Qatar Iran also has a parliament and hold presidential elections and is one of the most democratic governments in the middle east, even though the presidential candidates have to be approved by the clerical establishment there is enough leeway given that a relatively liberal reformer was elected recently (Rouhani). ", " >>13266Iran isnt a threat period, only fucking idiots believe that Iran is some kind of aggressive power. ", " >>13169>they are anti-west because they NEED to be politically, not because the west has fucked up half the world, the middle east, and Iranian itself with their constant blundering, tone deaf interventions to preserve their business interests across the world <:^)When will people from the US/Western world finally admit to themselves that the rest of the world has very good historical and contemporary reasons to hold the western world in contempt?

The report claimed that FSB officers directly aided potential jihadis who wanted to leave Russia to fight in the Middle East. While the FSB has not admitted aiding potential extremists, FSB deputy director Eugene Sysoev recently heralded Russia\u2019s success in \u201c[achieving] a sustained reduction in terrorist activity\u201d inside Russia. He cited a reduction in \u201ccrimes of a terrorist nature\u201d over the previous year, and claimed a ten-fold reduction in terrorist activity in the North Caucasus over the past five years. In the same remarks, made in November, Sysoev admitted that at least 20 percent of foreign fighters in the Islamic State are from Russia and other post-Soviet countries, an assessment somewhat similar to estimates from private security consulting groups. The interview with the purported FSB defector advanced the idea that Russia may be exporting its extremists, detailing how Russian security services have recruited Muslims to infiltrate extremist groups in Europe and materially supported their advancement within these organizations. When asked if Russian agents could be involved in the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Yevgeniy said there was \u201ccomplicity in acts of terrorism.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd the complicity could be direct or indirect. By analyzing their connections, one, of course, will be able to see the ties leading to Russia. Primarily Russia could benefit from this, and the Russian security services had all the possibilities to organize this.\u201d http://freebeacon.com/national-security/moscows-connection-to-the-islamic-state/ "}, "replies": [" The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks. On the Russian periphery, it is widely believed that Russia has used the Islamic State as an opportunity to get rid of domestic jihadis. \u201cIn spring 2014, local information networks provided credible information that individuals affiliated with Russian security forces were recruiting potential jihadists in Pankisi and in the Northern Caucasus to travel to Syria,\u201d says Giga Bokeria, a former Georgian national security adviser. \u201cThey were promising financing for trips, and assistance acquiring weapons.\u201d ", " Pankisi is a remote, mountainous Georgian region bordering Russia with a local population of Georgian Muslims, known as Kists. Omar al-Shishani, one of the Islamic State\u2019s top commanders, is from Pankisi. Oleksandr Danylyuk, formerly chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Defense and now chairman of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Defense Reforms, believes there is a strong connection between the Islamic State and the Russian government. \u201cISIS is definitely a product of the Russian special services. Only the blind cannot see it. A significant part of the terrorists are citizens of the Russian Federation,\u201d Danylyuk said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cThe ISIS military command is composed of former Saddam Hussein generals, who studied in the Soviet Union and worked closely with the KGB,\u201d says Danylyuk. \u201cThe connection between the Russian-speaking jihadis and the Russian-trained ex-Baathist Sunni military officers is what formed the core of what we now think of as ISIS,\u201d said Estonian expert Eerik-Niiles Kross. Kross, now a member of Estonian parliament, is a former director of the Estonian intelligence services, and served under the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq in 2003-2004, working to rebuild the Iraqi military intelligence organization. ", " \u201cBased on Russia\u2019s history of infiltrating and manipulating terrorist organizations and extremist groups, it\u2019s not so far-fetched to believe there is an operational relationship \u2014 at some level \u2014 between Russian security services and elements of ISIS,\u201d he said. The conflict in Syria has allowed Russia to rebuild relationships with European countries that were damaged by the Russian intervention in Ukraine. While the White House remains publicly cautious about collaborating with Russia against the Islamic State because of Russia\u2019s support for Bashar al-Assad, the possibility of a Russian connection to terrorist attacks in Western countries would add a new element to Russia\u2019s relationship to the West. In Washington, however, Russia\u2019s relationship with Islamic radicals has not been seriously evaluated, according to several congressional sources. \u201cThe issue of Russia\u2019s relationship with ISIS has been raised in closed door briefings on the Hill,\u201d said one senior staffer with knowledge of recent intelligence briefings to lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much the administration has looked into this issue.\u201d But people in states close to Russia say American and other Western officials have been reluctant to accept information on Russian involvement in recruitment for extremist groups despite the use of explicitly anti-American rhetoric as incitement for enlistment. \u201cMore than 80 percent of ISIS\u2019s weapons are Russian-made,\u201d offers Danylyuk. \u201cIn Syria and Iraq we are witnessing the same form of hidden aggression as in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cThe problem is,\u201d he says, \u201cif Russia is recruiting for ISIS, and ISIS is attacking European and American targets \u2014 will anyone be willing to say that Russia bears responsibility in these attacks?\u201dhttp://freebeacon.com/national-security/moscows-connection-to-the-islamic-state/ ", " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N3Uk8Y5km8 ", " I'd like to see this evaluated by other countries before accepting it, but it's not particularly hard to believe. It would be a pretty simple and convenient way for Russia to increasingly quell any Chechen resistance, considering most of those rebels are jihadists.

A border skirmish in the baltics should not be equal to a bombardment of a major USA city, and should not lead to the same result of total annihilation.The sad truth is that countries like Montenegro or the blatic states have no place in a rigid defensive alliance as broad as NATO. Armed provocations and even invasion should be dealt with, obviously, but not through something as dangerous and shortsighted as Article 5. This goes double for the baltic states, which have always been Russia's backyard.More to the point - NATO has no place in the 21st century, at least not in its current form. After the cold war ended (or paused, depending on your viewpoint) it should have been disbanded.

You dirty f****** pig-s******* s***.'On December 3, the day after MPs voted to authorise the air strikes, he wrote: 'I'm going to find her and show her what it's like to murder innocents. You dirty pig-f****** w****.'He also described shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn as a 'war criminal' and a 'terrorist' the day after the Commons vote to bomb Syria.His defence lawyer Abu Sayeed said Wallace had posted the messages after he had been out protesting against the Syrian bombing vote for 'two or three days and had very little sleep and had not taken his medication.' "}, "replies": [" Wallace has a string of convictions for violent offences including possession of a knife.He converted to Islam while in prison serving a sentence of almost five years for attempted robberyThree weeks after he was released he posted the messages on a thread of comments on the UK Truth Movement Facebook page.Wallace today pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications at Hendon Magistrates' Court.Wearing a white traditional Islamic dress and a grey jumper slung over his shoulders, he spoke only to confirm his name and address before entering a guilty plea. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on December 30.The court heard the messages came to light after Ms Leslie's father saw the comments online and reported them to police.Wallace claimed he was 'venting his anger' and had not had any sleep because he had been 'protesting for two or three days'.District Judge Mark Jabbitt said: 'What's absolutely clear is that your language and expressions about this MP Ms Leslie, who you have no knowledge of, went beyond any sort of legitimate comment or protest on an extremely serious issue.'What you did was personalised it and used really the most vile, insulting and threatening language imaginable on a forum.' ", " He ordered a full risk assessment report on Wallace and expressed concern that he was not being formally supervised after his release from prison.Abu Sayeed, defending, said Wallace has mental health issues and had not been taking his anti-psychotic medication.'He has co-operated fully with the police and expressed remorse and regret,' he added. 'He made the comments to vent his anger.'Mr Wallace is a Muslim convert, he converted while serving his last sentence. He feels very passionately about the bombing in Syria and the vote recently taken in Parliament.'He had been out with other protesters and was protesting for two or three days and not had much sleep and hadn't taken his medication.'Wallace has never met Ms Leslie and thought the page was a 'closed group', Mr Sayeed said.'In the current climate people would have been fearful of his comments,' he added.Wallace, whose mother died when he was young and who claims his father abused him as a child, had attended an anti-war rally outside Parliament on the day of the Syria vote and was pictured carrying a giant white poppy.Shortly before he sent the messages he also posed for a series of pictures with strangers carrying a placard that read: 'I am Muslim, I am labelled a terrorist, I trust you, do you trust me enough for a hug?'. ", " The day after the vote Wallace sent Mr Benn an email, which he then posted on his Facebook page.It said: 'I hope to God that you will have nightmares when you hear that kids woman and men have been murdered by your govt.' The court heard Wallace had been in and out of custody since he was 13 after being expelled from school following the death of his mother when he was eight. The judge warned Wallace the maximum sentence for the offence was six months.Wallace, of Teignmouth Road, Willesden Green was remanded into custody, while risk assessments reports were carried out.He is next appear at Willesden Magistrates court for sentencing on December 30.A number of other MPs, many of them in the Labour Party, have complained to police that they had received death threats after voting in favour of airstrikes on Islamic State in Syria.Neil Coyle, the MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, said police had stationed extra officers outside his surgery after he received an apparent death threat on social media, while Labour Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk has spoken out about receiving an apparent death threat on Facebook after he voted in favour of the military action.

Oleg Barna, a deputy in President Poroshenko's bloc approached the speaker's podium, where Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was delivering an address. Handing him a bouquet of roses, Barna started shoving Yatsenyuk, then tried to carry him away, even grabbing him between the legs and lifting him into the air. Immediately, several other deputies intervened and a mass brawl began.

Since it doesn't seem that there was any misunderstanding on Russia's part and the violation was intentional, then it must follow that Russia's war is currently being fought by idiots and/or scum that wanted to provoke Turkey into attacking.6. Russia's planned embargo against Turkey is a violation of multiple free trade agreements and combined with habitual border incursions, unilateral suspension of public diplomacy, and violent + malicious state rhetoric they constitute grounds to cite Article 5.It would seem to me that Russia is asking for it. Hollande knows Assad is prohibiting all political solitions in Syria and Iraq, and that IS can not be defeated as long as he exists in office. He also knows that without Russian air power Assad would not last another year. It would be perfectly reasonable for the existing anti-IS coalition to impose a no-fly zone over northern Syria and enable the local nationals to survive free of IS and Assad imposed terror. If these forces decide to mount an offensive against a particular Damascus based warlord, then that would be a Syrian prerogative.

Equality became revolution. Even if you look into what Kate Millet and her cronies pushed during the 60s you'll note it's nothing but garbage focused on destroying the west.
