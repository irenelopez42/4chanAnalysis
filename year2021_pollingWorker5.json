In 1996, a controlled study of 327 heterosexual men (half said they were homophobic by experience, with self-reported orientation) at the University of Georgia found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia) were considerably more likely to experience more erectile responses when exposed to homoerotic images than non-homophobic men. Bernard et al. 2012 arrived at similar results when researchers found that students who came from \"the most rigid anti-gay homes\" were most likely to reveal repressed homosexual attraction. The researchers said that this explained why some religious leaders who denounce homosexuality are later revealed to have secret homosexual relations. They noted that \"these people are at war with themselves and are turning this internal conflict outward.\" A 2016 eye-tracking study showed that heterosexual men with high negative impulse reactions toward homosexuals gazed for longer periods at homosexual imagery than other heterosexual men.\n\nNobody is to blame for your homosexuality.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, infects cells following recognition and attachment of the viral spike glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transmembrane protein, followed by spike protein cleavage and activation by cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). In prostate cancer cells, androgen acting on the androgen receptor increases TMPRSS2 expression, which has led to the hypothesis that androgen-dependent expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung may increase men's susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and that, accordingly, suppressing androgen production or action may mitigate COVID-19 severity by reducing SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Several ongoing clinical trials are testing the ability of androgen deprivation therapies or anti-androgens to mitigate COVID-19. This perspective discusses clinical and molecular advances on the rapidly evolving field of androgen receptor (AR) action on cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the potential effect of anti-androgens on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in male patients.

It's a GOD send anti parasitic, that has cured and damn near wiped out diseases like malaria. \nWhat you don't understand, is where this information comes from. \nivermeticin was suggested by Michael Yeadon, the ex chief of science for Pfizer. The ONLY reason he suggests it is because of T cells. What he explains is that the Tcells build up in the liver, and go to the lungs when the liver is full. \nIt is by no fucking means a cure for Covid. It is a treatment that does what you're body is supposed to be doing, which is creating T cells to commit sudoku in the liver. But the T cells are confused due to incorrect tagging from the anti bodies. So ivermeticin kills them.\nAll ivermeticin does is help kill off T cells (by coincidence) and if they're not building up, then there's 0 point to taking it. It's to combat the lung part of the illness and should only be used in early treatment. If they're on a ventilator then it's most likely too late. \nNow on the other hand, HQC, as noted by Fauci himself back in 2011 DOES help cure Covid by protecting the hemoglobin of red blood cells, which is what the virus is using to copy itself. But this too is an early treatment, and NOT a daily use medicine for long periods of time like 3-6 months. \nBut this all depends on your own immune system. You probably don't need anything besides the normal bed rest and constant fluids, unless you're 70+. \nI'm no doctor, nor do I work in any field of medicine. This is just the where the info came from, and how it was stated. But people keep on assuming shit, like \"Oh der ivermeticin is a cure, because some say it helps with something I have no fucking clue about\"\nDo some research and stop just taking every hint of advice that's not from the doctors. \nAlso ivermeticin is it's own thing.
