There is some controversy swirling around this order, though not about the above wording: some allege that it contained a section about the Soviet soldiers/partisans having to dress in German uniforms, to stir up hatred toward the Germans, because many Russians welcomed the arrival of the Germans. The authors of the IfZ article, Christian Hartmann and J\u00fcrgen Zarusky, discard this; what they found in Russian archives as well as in the Washington National Archives (Series 429, Roll 461) contains nothing of the sort. I do not doubt this order was given, but Stalin was surely not foolish enough to put it on paper. There is ample evidence, however, of partisans et al. wearing German uniforms, since German soldiers were routinely found naked and mutilated. Prof. Seidler, for instance, writes that more and more partisans were wearing German uniforms and that the number of foreigners, who had been employed as helpers (HIWIS) or as local policemen, deserting in German uniforms was steadily increasing (Seidler, p.34; Report by the Reichskommisar for Ukraine of June 25, 1943, Bundesarchiv Berlin, BDC O.217 II, Bl.108ff).\n\nThese Stalin orders were followed, with civilians the targets. Efforts were then made to make it look like Germans committed these crimes, this cannot be proven for obvious reasons, but the destruction was real: the T\u00e4tigkeits und Lageberichte (Action and situation reports, TuL) issued by the Einsatzgruppen provide ample evidence of the destruction left behind by the retreating Red Army troops as well as acts of sabotage committed while the territory was occupied by the Germans (the TuL are contained in Die Einsatzgruppen in der besetzten Sowjetunion 1941/1942, by Peter Klein.", ">>24714212\nJust... seriously?", ">>24713879\n\nThey did waste time try to `technicaly disprove the photographs`.\nBecause they are smart and recognize the photograph is not edited right away.\n\nHowever that still doesn't mean the individuals dressed in German uniforms are actual germans.\n\nWhat's important to such images is to know the source of it.

When they entered a village they immediately killed the village elder, then they locked the family into the house and burned it down. The villagers fled into the forest, but when discovered by the partisans they were killed. The partisans left mountains of bodies behind, as well as distraught woman and horrendous destruction (p. 181). And to be sure, all of those killed by the partisans were no doubt also blamed on the Germans. And as attacks by partisans on civilians were carried out with partisans at times doubtlessly wearing German uniforms, hatred towards Germans was the result, which was part of what was intended.\n\n\"The suppressed History of Crimes committed on German soldiers in WWII\" by Wilfried Heink", null, ">>24714321\nHitler and Stalin invaded Poland together.

Only after a Golden Dawn member fatally stabbed the rapper did police officers make an arrest, according to 15 police and witness depositions.\n\nThe arrest was the start of a risky crackdown on a party steeped in street violence and neo-Nazi rhetoric, whose surging support since last year symbolizes how Europe's economic crisis has fueled the Continent's most radical forces. From Spain to Finland, extremes of left and right, regional separatists and antiestablishment populists are on the march. Golden Dawn, once a fringe group known for stiff-arm salutes and Holocaust denial, rose to nearly 15% support in opinion polls by this fall.\n\nViolence in Greece hasn't come only from the far right. On Nov. 1, two men on a stolen motorcycle stopped at a Golden Dawn branch in an Athens suburb and shot two party activists dead.

Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German, arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the Nazi Party, Schindler lavishes bribes on Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials and acquires a factory to produce enamelware. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of Itzhak Stern, a local Jewish official who has contacts with black marketeers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange loans to finance the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.", "SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer (second lieutenant) Amon Goeth arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat \u2013 one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film \u2013 as she hides from the Nazis. When he later sees the red coat on a wagon loaded with bodies being taken away to be burned, he knows the girl is dead. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Goeth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Goeth brutally mistreats his maid and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant daily fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. He bribes Goeth into allowing him to build a sub-camp for his workers so that he can better protect them.", ">>24665049\n>>24665062\nReturn of the Jedi has begun.\n\nWe're back in action.", "As the Germans begin to lose the war, Goeth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to Auschwitz concentration camp.

Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs Schindler's workers begin to arrive at the new site, the train carrying the women is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz. Schindler bribes the commandant of Auschwitz with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards to enter the production areas and encourages the Jews to observe Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath).

The SS guards have been ordered to kill the Jews, but Schindler persuades them to return to their families as men, not murderers. He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role saving Jewish lives, together with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but is also deeply ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. As the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) awaken the next morning, a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated. The Jews leave the factory and walk to a nearby town.", "After some scenes depicting Goeth's execution and a summary of Schindler's later life, the black-and-white frame changes to a color shot of actual Schindlerjuden at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem.

Pfefferberg attempted to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through.[9][10] In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.[11] MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"[12] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.[12] At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.[13] In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.[1]", "Spielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".[13] Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.[13] Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama, The Pianist, in 2002. Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct Schindler's List in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"[14] Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of Cape Fear instead.[15] Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom died in the Holocaust.[5]", "Spielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that Holocaust deniers were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of neo-Nazism after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.[5] Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on one condition: that Spielberg make Jurassic Park first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed Schindler I wouldn't be able to do Jurassic Park.\"[2] The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.[16][2] Spielberg forewent a salary for the film, calling it \"blood money\",[2] and believed the film would flop.[2]", "In 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired Kurt Luedtke, who had adapted the screenplay of Out of Africa, to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.[14] During his time as director, Scorsese hired Steven Zaillian to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"[14]", "Neeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in Anna Christie on Broadway.[17] Warren Beatty participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".[18] Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.[19] Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"[20] To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of Time Warner CEO Steve Ross, who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.[21] He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.[22]", ">>24657277\njust ok\n>>24657298\nkek\n>>24657320\nIt's an adaptation of a memoir published in the late 1940s by the main character.\nTherefore not during the period of time where the Jews exacerbate the holocaust\nThe movie stays very true to the memoir and as such contains little anti-Nazi propaganda.\nMost feels in the movie is where he's playing on the piano in a bombed building and a high-ranking Nazi officer is just standing there listening.", ">>24657358\n>Swindler's List", "Fiennes was cast as Amon Goeth after Spielberg viewed his performances in A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia and Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"[23] Fiennes put on 28 pounds (13 kg) to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Goeth. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"[23] Fiennes looked so much like Goeth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.[23]\n\nThe character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of accountant Stern, factory manager Abraham Bankier, and Goeth's personal secretary, Mietek Pemper.[24] The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.[25] Kingsley is well known for his Academy Award winning performance as Gandhi in the 1982 biographical film.[26]", "Overall, there are 126 speaking parts in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.[14] Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.[27] Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.[18] Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.[14]", "Opfergang (1944) by Veit Harlan", "triumph des willens (triumph of the will)", "Principal photography began on March 1, 1993 in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days.[28] The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.[29][30] Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in Olkusz, while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.[31] The crew was forbidden to do extensive shooting or construct sets on the grounds at Auschwitz, so they shot at a replica constructed just outside the entrance.[32] There were some antisemitic incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that \"the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it\".[23] Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,[14] while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider.[33] Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at Passover, \"all the German actors showed up. They put on yarmulkes and opened up Haggadas, and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.\"[33]", ">>24665596\n\nTHe fuck man.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself angry and filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.[35] Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.[29] Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.[18] Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.[36] He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row ... when things just got too unbearable.\"[37] Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, because there was very little humor on the set.[37] Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.[38]", ">>24666030\nI don't know any other streaming websites.\n\nAt first I wanted to use twitchtv but I got instabanned there.\n\nKnow any better streaming sites?", "\"I was hit in the face with my personal life.

Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.[39] Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"[40] He filmed without using Steadicams, elevated shots, or zoom lenses, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"[40] This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.[33]", ">>24666157\nThe moment I tried to stream Hercules in New York it went insane and banned me.", "The decision to shoot the film mainly in black and white lent to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to German Expressionism and Italian neorealism.[40] Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"[29] Spielberg decided use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.[40] Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color negative, to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"[40]", "Music\n\nJohn Williams composed the score for Schindler's List. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\"[41] Itzhak Perlman performs the theme on the violin.[1]\n\nRegarding Schindler's List, Perlman said:\n\n Perlman: \"I couldn't believe how authentic he [John Williams] got everything to sound, and I said, 'John, where did it come from?' and he said, 'Well I had some practice with Fiddler on the Roof and so on, and everything just came very naturally' and that's the way it sounds.\"\n\n Interviewer: \"When you were first approached to play for Schindler's List, did you give it a second thought, did you agree at once, or did you say 'I'm not sure I want to play for movie music'?\n\n Perlman: \"No, that never occurred to me, because in that particular case the subject of the movie was so important to me, and I felt that I could contribute simply by just knowing the history, and feeling the history, and indirectly actually being a victim of that history.\"[42]\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song \"Oyfn Pripetshik\" (\"On the Cooking Stove\") (Yiddish: \u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7) is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.[43] The clarinet solos heard in the film were recorded by Klezmer virtuoso Giora Feidman.[44] Williams won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for Schindler's List, his fifth win.[45] Selections from the score were released on a soundtrack album.[46]", "The girl in red\nSchindler sees a girl in red during the evacuation. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.\n\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolise how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down ... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"[47] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"[48] Professor Andr\u00e9 H. Caron of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"[49]", "The girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and was \"horrified.\"[50] Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.[50] Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to Roma Ligocka, who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir (2002, in translation).[51]", "Candles\n\nThe opening scene features a family observing the Shabbat. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit ... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"[14] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"[14] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.[52] She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles and intones the Kiddush. In the film it is men who perform these rituals, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Goeth and Schindler.[53]", "Other symbolism\n\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"[54] Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in Nazi Germany between making use of the Jews for slave labor or exterminating them outright.[55] Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a Holocaust train loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.[56]", "www.soiledsinema.com\n\nmore /pol/ than /pol/", "Release\n\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993. By the time it closed in theaters on September 29, 1994, it had grossed $96.1 million ($155 million in 2013 dollars)[57] in the United States and over $321.2 million worldwide.[58] In Germany, where it was shown in 500 theaters, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone[59] and was eventually seen by six million people.[60] The film was popular in Germany and a success worldwide.[61]\n\nSchindler's List made its US network television premiere on NBC on February 23, 1997. Shown without commercials, it gained the highest Nielsen rating for any film since NBC's broadcast of Jurassic Park in May 1995. The broadcast was viewed by an estimated 65 million people.[62] The film aired on public television in Israel on Holocaust Memorial Day in 1998.[63]", "The DVD was released on March 9, 2004 in widescreen and fullscreen editions, on a double-sided disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg.[64] Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled Schindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a plexiglass case.[65] The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet.[66] As part of its 20th anniversary, the movie was released on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013.[67]\n\nFollowing the success of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit organization with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work.[68] Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).[69]", "Critical response\n\nSchindler's List is widely acclaimed as a remarkable achievement by film critics and audiences.[70] Notable Americans such as talk show host Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton urged their countrymen to see it.[71][3] World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg.[3] Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a movie that \"will take its place in cultural history and remain there.\"[72] Roger Ebert described it as Spielberg's best, \"brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.\"[73] Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's \"narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.\" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise,[74] and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz \"the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.\"[75] James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"[76] In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"[77]", ">>24666155\nAwesome! THough I dont think we'll find a stream website that doesn't require accounts for the host", "Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".[78] He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.[79] The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans didn't do more to help.[80]\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.[81] Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.[82] Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.[83] History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Goeth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.[84]", "Schindler's List was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote a long letter of appreciation to Spielberg in which he proclaimed, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"[5] Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"[88] He cited Schindler's List as an influence on his 1995 film Death and the Maiden.[89] The success of Schindler's List led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.[90] When scriptwriter Frederic Raphael suggested that Schindler's List was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.\"[90]", "Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit of tragedy while Schindler's wife, Emilie Schindler, lived in poverty in Argentina.[91] Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"[92] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.[92] Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"[93]", "The film was attacked by filmmaker and professor Claude Lanzmann, director of the nine-hour Holocaust documentary Shoah, who called Schindler's List a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. Lanzmann was especially critical of Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German. Believing his own film to be the definitive account of the Holocaust, Lanzmann complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before Shoah, and a time after Shoah, and that after Shoah certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"[94] Spielberg accused him of wanting to be \"the only voice in the definitive account of the Holocaust. It amazed me that there could be any hurt feelings in an effort to reflect the truth.\"[95]", "Reaction of the Jewish community\n\nAt a 1994 Village Voice symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.[96] Hungarian Jewish author Imre Kert\u00e9sz, a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.[97] Rabbi Uri D. Herscher found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.[98] Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.[99] Albert L. Lewis, Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"[98]", ">>24665877\nI put a Laugh track on my copy", "Accolades\n\nSchindler's List featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the Time magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel,[100] Time Out magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,[101] and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".[102] The Vatican named Schindler's List among the most important 45 films ever made.[103] A Channel 4 poll named Schindler's List the ninth greatest film of all time,[104] and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.[105] The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as James Berardinelli,[106] Roger Ebert,[73] and Gene Siskel.[107] Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004.[108]", "Does it say anywhere in the wikipedia article that the movie is based on a book by the same name, that won \"best fiction\"?", ">>24665049\nDid the jews circumcise you?", "Spielberg won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film for his work,[109] and shared the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

Bulbs are far more complex than a single LED. They have power converter phases, and current protection. Those circuits use caps, and caps are rated for only so many hours at a specific temperature. LED bulbs get hot, that means the caps get hot, and that means their lifespan is shortened. A high quality bulb like a Cree or a Phillips will use a 105c rated solid Japanese caps in their power phases. If the bulb reaches 90c, and they very well do, then that cap only only last about 1 year of actual run time, 3 years if on only 8 hours a day. This is a fairly generous estimate as other components used are also affected by heat in the same way, and are not necessarily of the same caliber.

It is the oldest DNA to be recovered from an early humanlike species, authors of a study wrote in the journal Nature.\n\nThe ancient species that has revealed some of its genetic secrets, via bone fragments from a femur, is probably not directly linked to your family tree though.\n\n\"It's quite clear that this is not a direct ancestor of people today,\" said Svante Paabo, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and senior author of the study.\n\nInstead, he said, this representative of an early humanlike species, called Homo heidelbergensis, could be an ancestor of both Neanderthals and another group called the De nisovans.\n\nThe genetic relationship to Denisovans, discovered through this DNA research, is surprising because the Homo heidelbergensis remains found in the cave have many Neanderthal-like features. The only remnants of Denisovans come from Siberia -- a long way from Spain.\n\n\"It's sort of an open question really what this means, and I think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that,\" Paabo said."}, "replies": ["How they did it\n\nPaabo and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient, degraded genetic material to put together the 400,000-year-old specimen's mitochondrial genome. It is the oldest DNA ever found outside permafrost conditions -- in other words, it was not permanently frozen.\n\n\"The retrieval of such ancient human DNA is a major technical achievement, and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range, both in the Sima and elsewhere, where we would not previously have expected it, or looked for it,\" said Chris Stringer, researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the study.\n\nMitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms. DNA stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only (i.e., only moms can pass it on), so it's only a small snapshot of inherited genes.\n\nGenetic material in the cell's nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage.\nTo study genetics of our ancient predecessors, researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial DNA because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell.\n\n\"It's a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved,\" Paabo said.", "The method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the DNA double helix. They then make a \"library\" from each of the two strands. If part of one strand is damaged, its analogue on the other strand -- which is made of complementary genetic partners -- may be intact.\n\n\"That is sort of the big trick involved,\" Paabo said.\n\nAfter sequencing the mitochondrial DNA, researchers then compared the result with genetic information about Neanderthals and Denisovans.\n\nSince nuclear DNA encompasses more information about a person's inheritance, a nuclear genome sequence from Homo heidelbergensis may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species, he said.\n\nBut retrieving the nuclear DNA sequence will be challenging, study authors wrote. Just to get the mitochondrial DNA sequence, it took about two grams of bone -- less than 0.1 ounce -- even though hundreds of copies of this DNA are in every cell.\n\nStill, Paabo said, the sequencing technique his group used \"opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites, and really begin to understand earlier human evolution.\"", "Relationship to other species\n\nResearchers thought initially the mitochondrial DNA of the Homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with Neanderthals. Neanderthals lived in Europe beginning as much as 300,000 years ago, Paabo said. (Homo sapiens, our species, first appeared in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.)\n\nInstead, researchers discovered through the DNA that this specimen is closer to the Denisovans, a group related to the Neanderthals.\n\nA likely explanation is that in Eastern Eurasia this species gave rise to Denisovans, and in Western Eurasia they were the ancestors of Neanderthals, Paabo said. But more research needs to be done to verify that theory.\n\nLittle is known about the Denisovans. Although some of their remains were found in southern Siberia, their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the Pacific.", "Paabo was also the senior author on a 2012 study in the journal Science analyzing the Denisovan genome. That research suggested that human ancestors and the Denisovans' ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as 700,000 years ago -- although that number is vague. Still, it seems that the Denisovans must have mated with indigenous people in Papua New Guinea and Australia, Paabo said.\n\nAbout 3% to 5% of the DNA of people from Melanesia (islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean), Australia and New Guinea as well as aboriginal people from the Philippines comes from the Denisovans.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone who lives outside Africa today probably has some Neanderthal DNA in them, Paabo said in 2012.\n\nThe bottom line, Paabo said, is that the relationships between these early human relatives -- Homo heidelbergensis, Neanderthals and Denisovans -- are not clear-cut.\n\n\"It's going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of DNA,\" he said.\n\nEND", null, "tl;dr?"]}, "24027392": {"op": {"timestamp": 1386688866, "title": null, "comment": "which is the best christian denomination?\n\nto me it's\n\n>Lutheranism\n>Catholicism\n>Calvinism\n>Anglicanism\n.\n.\n.\n>Orthodoxism"}, "replies": ["quakerism", "Jehovas' witness."]}, "24013329": {"op": {"timestamp": 1386654887, "title": "Okay Britbongs, how the fuck did you let this happen?", "comment": "I know you guys are spineless as fuck, as all the alpha's went to the North American colonies, So I guess I just want to hear your excuses for being pussified limey scum."}, "replies": [">>24013329\n4got link\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9uq5X3OGjU", ">>24013329\n>as all the alpha's went to the North American colonies\n\nThis is what Americans actually believe.

What the dictator did know was politics and how to achieve public support--Hitler was an immensely popular leader with approval ratings even Bill Clinton would envy--and early on, he made it clear that economics would be subordinate to politics.", ">>23896704\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmm5xjyPS0s\n\nYou will never have a qt 3.14 aryan gf that knows you better than anyone else", "One odd result of Hitler's decision is that few of his biographers have paid much attention to his economic policies prior to the Nazis' first overt military act, the reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936. Indeed, if they pay any attention at all to the subject, most merely accept Nazi propaganda claims of Hitler's \"economic miracle\" in restoring Germany's prosperity. Kershaw's book is a welcome exception to this tendency.\n\nThe general view that Germany's shattered economy surged to life in the first few years of the Nazi regime is typified by Sebastian Haffner, a German writer whose short book The Meaning of Hitler (1979) received extravagant praise in John Lukacs' recent The Hitler of History. As Haffner put it, \"Among these positive achievements of Hitler the one outshining all others was his economic miracle....In January 1933, when Hitler became Reich Chancellor, there were six million unemployed in Germany. A mere three years later, in 1936, there was full employment. Crying need and mass hardship had generally turned into modest but comfortable prosperity.", "\"Almost equally important: helplessness and hopelessness had given way to confidence and self-assurance. Even more miraculous was the fact that the transition from depression to economic boom had been accomplished without inflation, at totally stable wages and prices. Not even Ludwig Erhard succeeded in doing that later in post-war Western Germany.\"\n\nHaffner is hardly alone in his glowing evaluation of Hitler's supposed economic miracle. In his highly influential Origins of the Second World War (1961), British historian A.J.P. Taylor similarly gave the Nazis credit for creating widespread prosperity, concluding, \"The Nazi secret was not armament production; it was freedom from the then orthodox principles of economics. Government spending provided all the happy effects of mild inflation; while political dictatorship, with its destruction of trade unions and rigorous exchange control, prevented such unfortunate consequences as a rise in wages, or in prices.\"\n\nKershaw's version of things more accurately reflects what was really happening in Germany from 1933 through 1935. Hitler's economic policies were systematically wrecking the German economy and were rapidly painting him into a corner where his only choices were war or a loss of power.", "Hitler, argues Kershaw, was deathly afraid of inflation and a repetition of the early 1920s. Nevertheless, he had to reduce unemployment or he wasn't going to last long enough to begin rearming Germany, a public goal of his since the '20s. Increasing exports was not a possibility since, unless the German government devalued the mark (as Britain had done with the pound and the United States with the dollar), German exports couldn't compete in a way that would add new jobs or bring needed foreign exchange. Hitler nixed devaluation because he thought it was a step on the road to inflation. Tax cuts were also out of the question because he believed they led to less revenue not more growth.\n\nHitler's solution for both the rearmament and unemployment problems was the same: massive deficit spending. In fact, by Kershaw's account, the Nazi government guaranteed some 35 billion ReichMarks to the German armed forces alone over an eight-year period, along with massive road building, subsidies to the auto industry, lots more bureaucrats to enforce all the new controls and regulations, and bribes to women to get married and stop working.\n\nDid such policies reduce unemployment from 6 million in 1933 to 1 million three years later? Not exactly. Statistics from Dan Silverman's Hitler's Economy (1998) show that unemployment was reduced in Germany from 34 percent or about 6 million people, in January 1933, to 14 percent, or 2.5 million people, in January 1936. That's a dramatic reduction, to be sure, but hardly full employment. Even the 2.5 million number is extremely unreliable, as Stephen Roberts, an economic historian at Australia's University of Sydney who lived in Germany in the mid-'30s, explained in his 1937 work, The House That Hitler Built.", "A wonderful night.", "The \"official statistics naturally tell only part of the story,\" wrote Roberts. \"They do not take into account the Marxians, Socialists, Jews and pacifists who have lost their jobs and are cut off from relief; such persons do not appear in the official figures of unemployment. The refugees are ignored. In addition, at least a million people have been absorbed in the army, the labour-service camps, the Nazi organizations, and various partly-paid forms of labour on public works. Half a million women have been taken off the labour market in the last four years by means of the marriage allowance paid by the Government to entice them away....What they have done has been to introduce a series of emergency steps which have drastically reduced the number of unemployed; but such steps, by their very nature, are in many cases temporary. On the other hand, the reduction [in unemployment], however artificially it may have been achieved, has had a tremendous propaganda value for the Government, and there is the fixed belief of most Germans today that Hitler has achieved wonders in providing employment.\"\n\nHitler paid for his economic \"miracle\" partly by depleting his nation's gold reserves, which he used to import critical raw materials for the manufacture of weapons. When he took office, the Reichbank had reserves totaling 937 million ReichMarks; four years later, that figure was down to only 72 million ReichMarks. Massive government borrowing financed the rest of the government-driven economy. As Roberts put it, \"The Nazi state is being financed by short-term [90 day] loans--up to 15 billion Reichmarks by the end of 1936....In short, Germany is going round and round. She can get nowhere until she returns to normal economic conditions, but she is afraid to try and get back to those, because she fears economic collapse and social upheaval if she does so.\"", ">>23896804\n>kikes cannot imagine a successful economy without inflation\n\nWhat's new?", ">>23896789\n\nwhat Kershaw is good ?", "Kershaw makes the same point and suggests that it was this fear of social unrest, heightened by serious food shortages in Germany during the fall of 1935--themselves largely the result of government policies--that played the major role in Hitler's decision to reoccupy the Rhineland in March 1936. Keep in mind that Hitler's reoccupation of the Rhineland was considered one of his \"brilliant\" strokes precisely because it was so unexpected--Germany was unprepared militarily or economically to carry out any extended effort in support of what even Hitler conceded to intimates was nothing more than a bold bluff.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that Hitler moved on the Rhineland when he did because the world was distracted by Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia. Kershaw allows that motive as a contributing factor but contends that turmoil in Germany occasioned by the food shortages is the real key to the timing of such a risky initiative. Indeed, he argues that Hitler invaded precisely because he knew it would be extraordinarily popular within Germany and divert public attention from his domestic difficulties.\n\nContrary to A.J.P. Taylor, by late 1935 Germany was experiencing anything but the happy effects of mild inflation and freedom from orthodox principles of economics. As Kershaw writes, A summary of price and wage levels prepared for Hitler on 4 September 1935 showed almost half of the German work-force earning gross wages of 18 ReichMarks or less per week. This was substantially below the poverty line...Wages, then, remained at the 1932 levelsubstantially lower than the last preDepression year of 1928 in the much-maligned Weimar Republic. Food prices, on the other handhad risen officially by 8 per cent since 1933. Overall living costs were higher by 5.4 per cent. Official rates did not, however, tell the whole tale. Increases of 33, 50, and even 150 per cent had been reported for some foodstuffs. By late summer, the terms food crisis and provisions crisis were in common use", "These facts were well known at thetime, both within and without Germany. Roberts and others had written about them, attributing the food shortages to Hitler's centralized agricultural policy, which had virtually eliminated food imports while implementing government controls. The predictable result: Germany produced less food, causing both shortages and price increases. According to Roberts, wheat went up 15 percent, eggs 50 percent, butter 40 percent, potatoes 75 percent, and most meat 50 percent--all despite \"official\" and ineffectual price controls which Hitler for appearances' sake refused to lift. Well into Hitler's \"miracle,\" Kershaw notes, \"poor living-standards, falling real wages, and steep price increases in some necessities...[were] the dismal reality behind the `fine facade of the Third Reich.'\"\n\nAt the same time, a ferocious eco-nomic policy battle was being waged over foreign exchange reserves: Should they be used to buy food imports or raw materials for armament production, the latter being Hitler's primary purpose since he first took office? Hitler appointed Hermann G\u00f6ring (who knew less about economics than Hitler) to mediate between Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht, who wanted to purchase raw materials for armaments, and Agriculture Minister Walther Darre, who wanted food to cover up his failed policies. Schacht, a social friend of G\u00f6ring's, expected a rubber stamp in favor of raw materials for arms. To everyone's surprise, except Hitler's, G\u00f6ring chose food, an answer that set Germany on the road to foreign conquest.", ">>23896841\nWhy was the beard shooped black? I always wondered.", "that didn't take long to get shitted up\n\nI aint even a nazi, just like how these guys marched", "As Kershaw sees it, Hitler gave priority to food imports because the \"immediate prime need was to avoid the damaging psychological effects of the only alternative: food rationing.\" But this decision, in turn, adversely affected German rearmament. \"By early 1936,\" says Kershaw, \"available supplies of raw materials for rearmament had shrunk to a precariously low level. Only one to two month supplies were left. Schacht demanded a slow down in the pace of rearmament....As Hitler entered his fourth year as Chancellor, the economic situation posed a real threat to rearmament plans. At the very time when international developments encouraged the most rapid expansion possible, the food crisis--and the social unrest in its turn--was sharply applying the brakes to it....Any slow down in rearmament...would inevitably bring increased unemployment in its train...[Hitler] saw this as all the more reason to hasten expansion to gain `living-space.'\"\n\nIn other words, if Hitler had to spend foreign exchange reserves for food to keep the people happy, he would have to get the raw materials for armaments by taking them. Otherwise, there would be more unemployment when the arms workers were laid off due to a lack of raw materials. Hitler knew he couldn't survive both food shortages and a resurgence of unemployment.", "Commenting in early 1937 on G\u00f6ring's Four Year Plan for economic self-sufficiency, Roberts had presciently predicted the inevitability of either war or Hitler's fall from power. \"There are 34 vital materials without which a nation cannot live, and unfortunately, Germany is worse off than any other great state insofar as these are concerned,\" he observed. \"Whereas the British Empire is largely dependent on outside sources for only nine of these, Germany has only two in ample quantities--potash and coal. That means she must turn to the foreigner for all of her supplies of 26 of these and for part of six more. Yet this is the Power that sees fit to launch a plan for complete self sufficiency. It is ludicrous, unless she looks forward to obtaining control of the vast raw materials of central Europe or the lands beyond the Ukraine by some adventurous foreign policy....That is [Hitler's] basic dilemma. If he persists in the [economic] policies he has enunciated, he plunges Europe into war; if he abandons them, he can no longer maintain his position within Germany.\"\n\nIt's not that Hitler lacked contrary advice. Kershaw tells us that in October 1935 Price Commissioner Carl Goerdeler sent Hitler in October, 1935, \"a devastating analysis of Germany's economic position.\" According to Kershaw, Goerdeler \"favored a return to market economy, a renewed emphasis upon exports, and a corresponding reduction in the rearmament drive--in his view at the root of the economic problems....If things carried on as they were, only a hand-to-mouth existence would be possible after January 1936.\" But Goerdeler was ignored and later dismissed. Instead, Germany reoccupied the Rhineland, to widespread popular acclaim, and G\u00f6ring unveiled his Four Year Plan, putting the economy firmly on a war footing.", "Hitler himself apparently never had a clue that the economic policies he had followed for the first three years of his regime were responsible for his production problems. By 1936, Kershaw makes clear, Hitler believed his own press clippings regarding his economic acumen. Thus, for Hitler, the food crisis only confirmed his preconceptions. In the secret memorandum on which G\u00f6ring's Four Year Plan was based, Hitler wrote, \"We are overpopulated and cannot feed ourselves from our own resources. The solution ultimately lies in extending the living space of our people, that is, in extending the sources of its raw materials and foodstuffs.\" That is, the problem is not my fault and the answer is war, not economic reform.\n\nHitler's fears of losing power were not without foundation. His great nemesis, the Soviet Union, found that out 50 years later. In the 1980s, it could not keep up with increased U.S. defense spending and sustain what William E. Odom in The Collapse of the Soviet Military (1998) terms \"a permanent war economy\" in which 20 to 40 percent of the gross domestic product went to the military. The Soviets faced the same choice as Hitler: economic reform or war? Thankfully, the Soviet leaders chose economic reform, even though it didn't save them or their regime. Freeing yourself from orthodox principles of economics can be a tricky thing.\n\nhttp://reason.com/archives/1999/08/01/nazi-economics", ">>23896310\n>that quality\n>literal animu music\nseriously krautboos step it up", "The Generalplan Ost (GPO) (English: Master Plan East) was a secret Nazi German plan for the colonization of Central and Eastern Europe.[1] Implementing it would have necessitated genocide[2] and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale to be undertaken in these European territories, occupied by Germany during World War II. It would have included the enslavement, expulsion and extermination of most Slavic peoples in Europe. The plan, prepared in the years 1939\u20131942, was part of Adolf Hitler's and the Nazi movement's Lebensraum policy and a fulfillment of the Drang nach Osten (English: Drive towards the East) ideology of German expansion to the east, both of them part of the larger plan to establish the New Order.\n\nThe body responsible for the drafting of this plan was the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt - RSHA), the security organ of the SS responsible for fighting all enemies of Nazism. It was a strictly confidential document, and its contents were known only to those at the topmost level of the Nazi hierarchy.\n\nAccording the testimony of SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Dr. Hans Ehlich (one of the witnesses in Case VIII before the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials), the final version of the plan was drafted in 1940. As a high official in the RSHA, Ehlich was the man responsible for the drafting of Generalplan Ost along with Dr. Konrad Meyer, Chief of the Planning Office of Himmler's Reichskommissariat for the Strengthening of German Nationhood. It had been preceded by the Ostforschung, a number of studies and research projects carried out over several years by various academic centres toprovidethe necessary facts and figures.The preliminary versions were discussed by the SS head HeinrichHimmler and his most trusted colleagues even before the outbreak of war. This was mentioned by SSObergruppenf\u00fchrer ErichvondemBachZelewski during hisevidence as a prosecution witness inthe trialof officials of the SS-Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt RuSHA SS Office of Race and Settlement", ">>23896913\n>>23896895\n>>23896875\n>>23896841\n\nAll good stuff anon...", ">>23896538\nmore like zionist churchill and poland basically forced Germany into WW2 when they started killing/maiming the German populations of Pomern and Silesia just because they felt like it.\n\ngood link here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7c9tB77YdU&list=HL1386403045&feature=mh_lolz", "Nearly all the wartime documentation on Generalplan Ost was deliberately destroyed shortly before Germany's defeat in May 1945.[3][4] Thus, no copies of the plan were found after the war among the documents in German archives. Apart from Ehlich's testimony, there are several documents which refer to this plan or are supplements to it. Although no copies of the actual document have survived, most of the plan's essential elements have been reconstructed from related memos, abstracts and other ancillary documents.[5]\n\nOne principal document which made it possible to recreate with a great deal of accuracy the contents of Generalplan Ost is a memo of April 27, 1942 entitled Stellungnahme und Gedanken zum Generalplan Ost des Reichsf\u00fchrers SS (\"Opinion and Ideas Regarding the General Plan for the East of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\") and written by Dr. Erich Wetzel, the director of the Central Advisory Office on Questions of Racial Policy of the Nazi Party (Leiter der Hauptstelle Beratungsstelle des Rassenpolitischen Amtes der NSDAP). This memorandum is an elaboration of Generalplan Ost.[5]\n\nPhases of the plan and its implementation\nFurther information: Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany and Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen\nMap to Document 5: General Plan East with bases and marches in the Baltic states, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Crimea (Planning of the Institute for Agriculture and Agrarian politics of the Friedrich Wilhelm University (Berlin).\nOrigins of German colonists resettled during the \"Heim ins Reich\" action to annexed Polish territories.\n\nThe final version of Generalplan Ost, essentially a grand plan for ethnic cleansing, was divided into two parts; the \"Small Plan\" (Kleine Planung), which covered actions which were to be taken during the war, and the \"Big Plan\" (Grosse Planung), which covered actions to be undertaken after the war was won, and to be implemented gradually over a period of 25 to 30 years.[5][6]", "Do you have the raw material from Kershaw this seems to me to be a paraphrasing interpretation with no real quotes of the statements made by the original author.", "Percentages of ethnic groups targeted for elimination by Nazi Germany from future settlement areas[7][8] Ethnic group Percentage subject to removal\nPoles 80-85%\nRussians 50-60% to be physically eliminated and another 15% to be sent to Western Siberia.\nBelarusians 75%\nUkrainians 65%\nLithuanians 85%\nLatvians 50%\nEstonians 50%[9]\nCzechs 50%\nLatgalians 100%\n\nGeneralplan Ost envisaged differing percentages of the various conquered nations undergoing Germanization (for example, 50% of Czechs, 35% of Ukrainians and 25% of Belarusians), extermination, expulsion and other fates, the net effect of which would be to ensure that the conquered territories would be Germanized. In ten years' time, the plan effectively called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all East and West Slavs living behind the front lines in Europe. The \"Small Plan\" was to be put into practice as the Germans conquered the areas to the east of their pre-war borders. In this way the plan for Poland was drawn up at the end of November 1939 and is probably responsible for much of the World War II expulsion of Poles by Germany (first to colonial district of the General Government and, from 1942 also to Polenlagers).[10]", ">>23897014\nI don't give a fuck about that, I only pay attention to the information, do you really not have the capacity to disregard the noise from the source of information? I bet you watch TV too.", ">>23895957", "After the war, under the \"Big Plan\", Generalplan Ost foresaw the removal of 45 million non-Germanizable people from Central and Eastern Europe, of whom 31 million were \"racially undesirable\", 100% of Jews, Poles (85%), Belorussians (75%) and Ukrainians (65%), to West Siberia,[3] and about 14 millions were to remain, but were to be treated as slaves.[5] In their place, up to 8-10 million Germans would be settled in an extended \"living space\" (Lebensraum). Because the number of Germans appeared to be insufficient to populate the vast territories of Central and Eastern Europe, the peoples judged to lie racially between the Germans and the Russians (Mittelschicht), namely, Latvians and even Czechs, were also supposed to be resettled there.[11]\n\nAccording to Nazi intentions, attempts at Germanization were to be undertaken only in the case of those foreign nationals in Central and Eastern Europe who could be considered a desirable element for the future Reich from the point of view of its racist theories. The Plan stipulated that there were to be different methods of treating particular nations and even particular groups within them. Attempts were even made to establish the basic criteria to be used in determining whether a given group lent itself to Germanization. These criteria were to be applied more liberally in the case of nations whose racial material (rassische Substanz) and level of cultural development made them more suitable than others for Germanization. The Plan considered that there were a large number of such elements among the Baltic nations. Dr. Wetzel felt that thought should be given to a possible Germanization of the whole of the Estonian nation and a sizable proportion of the Latvians. On the other hand, the Lithuanians seemed less desirable since they contained too great an admixture of Slav blood. Himmler's view was that \"almost the whole of the Lithuanian nation would have to be deported to the East\".[7]", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost", ">>23897155\nSo all that amounts to a JIDF ranting article on wikipedia?

But better men are only so weak, because they do not know themselves or are disunited.\u2019\u201d\nFollowing this, it is time to make him understand what secret societies can accomplish.\nHe should show him the example of the Jesuits and the Freemasons.

On other occasions he should say, \u201cIf I had the opportunity to join such an order, I would do so immediately.\u201d\nAll this must be repeated often.\nThen he should suddenly say, \u201cI have finally found that for which I have wished for so long: one wants to accept me into such an Order.

The Grand Master and Wardens carry gavels. Otherwise, no one wears a jewel. Further, no tapis[5] is to be seen. The Secretary keeps the minutes.

However, all this knowledge is of no value and becomes lost to the world, if we do not make the world wiser and better. For the execution of this grand plan encompasses knowledge of the human heart and self-knowledge as the most essential parts.

Thus, away with all reservation! Among men who seek to better themselves and others and who want to help this diseased world, all pretenses must cease. We study the human heart: However, the further one progresses in this art, the more indulgent and patient one becomes and the more one realizes to what extent we are governed by circumstances and passions, how little it is often our own doing that we are neither better nor worse. Thus, we are not afraid to confess our flaws to one another, to bring this to one another\u2019s attention in brotherly love, and by this to hone our acumen and powers of observation.

Therefore, begin with yourself; examine yourself often according to the questions you will find prescribed in this degree of the Order. Do you believe to be inwardly as you appear on the outside?

In yourself, in your heart you will find all men. All are subject to the same nature, the same instincts. Everyone loves himself, loves himself in others. As you consistently find actions and consequences similar to your own in others, so the causes and motivations must be similar with similar actions. He who knows himself well, knows all; he whose does not know himself, knows no one. He who knows himself falsely or little, will judge others as erroneously. He does not seek in others what they are, but only his most foolish desires, his passions. From yourself, discover what others are, but do not let the treacherous looking glass flatter you; and trust it the least, if it shows you in too beautiful a light, because we all have our flaws.

Since you feel in your own heart how little human beings fulfill their destiny, to what degree all public institutions have degenerated, how little the teachers of wisdom have managed to pitch human beings to a different tune and bring their interest in doing good close to their hearts, you can easily see that this must have been cause by the means they have used: Therefore they must be chosen better, if virtue and wisdom are ever to govern the world once more, and this is the business of our illustrious Order.

Should we merely sigh? Should we never attempt to throw off this yoke?", ">>23871717\nNo, my Brother! Place your trust in us!

Only he who sees with the eyes of Minerva\u2019s Bird, laboring under the protection of this benevolent star (he points to the moon) will surely find them.\n\nNow review with us once more the entire sphere of influence you will enter by joining this inner circle.\u201d\n\n(The Secret Secretary reads:)", ">>23871284\nI saw you hyping this last week nice to see your work", ">>23871744\nGeneral Overview of the Entire Order.\n\nThe further you, my Br., advance in our ill. Ord., the more you will be convinced that our principles are of such a kind that they do not need to fear the light, if human beings were as they should be. Sadly, however, very much is still lacking. Truths that are not presented under concealment and in sacred ceremonies are not truths to most people. The hidden tempts them, and they are captivated by the pleasure of knowing something that is not known to everyone so that they direct their attention to matters they would have otherwise ignored, no matter how important they are, and in this manner, the unadulterated truth must imprint itself in their souls in indelible characters. There are also sentences that cannot be presented in a direct manner, that require thorough contemplation, repeated effort, and not everyone is inclined to this; yet everyone likes to think of himself as the wisest man. Thus, if I wish to initiate into a system that relies heavily on middle movements he would not likely have found in this chain through his own reasoning, I must conceal the complete development with a shroud until he is sufficiently prepared to see the whole light and the allure of attaining this must move him to pay attention to everything, even the smallest detail.

These have always been veiled by secret mystery schools behind images, presented to their pupils by and by, and according to this plan, the hieroglyphs of the three symbolic degrees of the Fr. Ms. are also organized. Everything our ill. Order teaches and does must affect the best of the world, must lead to elevation to raise humanity once more from the depths of perdition into which it has descended, making it receptive for higher a good and wisdom. This is why the Order has also studied the outward institutions of all public and secret organizations, preserved the best parts, and avoided their errors. Yea! Even now, its outer plan of operation becomes more solid and more fitting to the times every day. But even the best intentions are often thwarted by evil men or desecrated by unworthy ones: However, our secrecy and the strict tests of our mbrs. preserve us from both. Now let us summarize the Ord.\u2019s entire plan in a single point: our final goal is to:\n\nI. Proliferate pure truth.\n\nII. Make virtue victorious.", ">>23871899\nTo attain the first goal, people must be purged from prejudice, their minds must be enlightened; then with joint forces, the sciences must be purged from unnecessary subtleties; correct principles, drawn from natures must be established, and thus, the unobstructed path to approach the pure, now hidden truth must be opened to humanity. Therefore, we must unlock every source of research, reward every suppressed talent, pull every genius from the dust, teach pure principles according to the constitution of the age everywhere, educate the youth, unite the best minds with an inseverable bond, dispute superstition, faithlessness, and folly boldly, but wisely, and finally train all our people in such a manner that they have a uniform, straight, and correct understanding of all things.", ">>23871925\nThe Seed School of the Minerval Class serves this purpose, followed by the lesser Freemasonry, whom the Ord. seeks to influence as much as possible and guide according to our grand purpose, and finally the Higher Class, where the results of our efforts and the traditions of our ancestors are fully revealed. However, to provide virtue a firm seating, we test and train our pupils\u2019 hearts with incredible effort. Afterwards, anything can be accomplished with these men. But one cannot proceed with common means. No amount of teaching and preaching will help, or it would have helped long ago. There is no truth to be found that has not been repeated often, no duty that has not already been taught, and the world remains as it has always been; where it is no worse, it is as bad as it was a thousand years ago; the reason for this is that there are many institutions that promote vice, and they far more powerful than that which our preachers can accomplish. Therefore, from our side, force must be met with force. But here, one must examine the source of evil: Why are there so many evil persons, and so few good? Because the allure of evil is greater, since one can accomplish more with it in the world. \u2013 Her, the scales must be tipped in favor of virtue. One must endeavor to bring it to a point where the just man also can secure the external reward for his righteousness in this world. (However, the priests and princes as well as the current political climate oppose use greatly in this endeavor. What then should we do? Encourage revolutions, overthrow everything, drive out violence with violence, replace tyrants with tyrants? Far be it from us! Every violent reform is pernicious, because it does not improve things as long as human beings adhere to their passions as they are, and because wisdom does not require such force.)", ">>23871961\nThe Ord.\u2019s entire plan is based on educating humanity, however not through declamation, but by promoting and rewarding virtue. One must secretly tie the hands of those who promote vice and govern them without oppressing them. In a word, one must introduce a general regimen of morality, a form of government encompassing the entire world without dissolving the civic bonds by which all other governments continue their progress and can do anything except thwart the grand purpose of making good victorious over evil once more. This was even Christ\u2019s intention when he introduced a pure religion. Human beings were to become wise and good, were to allow themselves to be guided by wiser and better persons for their own good. In those days, however, when everything was in darkness, even the sermons could suffice. The novelty of wisdom had an overwhelming allure. Today, this is not so. More powerful means than mere education must be applied to give virtue an outward allure for the sensual man. Passions cannot be extinguished, but one must only know how to direct them toward noble purposes. One must show the ambitious man that true honor for which he yearns rests in virtue and can never be satisfied better by practicing the same. One must show the miser who wants own everything that he actually owns nothing, and one must show the libertine that overindulgence will sour every joy, \u2013 in short, that everyone satisfies his passions, whose origin is pure, best when he keeps it within the confines of virtue and that the Order will provide him with the means for this.", ">>23871925\ntl;dr pls", ">>23871990\nThus, all our people must be pitched to a single tune, cling tightly to one another, have only one goal in mind, assist each other, and thus impregnate the entire world. One must gather a legion of men around the great men of the world, men who tirelessly guide the whole matter for the good of humanity, men who change the entire nation; no external force is required. The rulers of the world will soon open their eyes, and they will see that their advantage will be increased, but that they will run into unfathomable difficulties when they enforce evil. The nobler men will soon gain the upper hand on the evil ones who now play masters and bring unhappiness to anyone who resists them. But those who are too womanly, too prejudiced, too inactive to earnestly fight for the rights of humanity must be motivated; good men must seek one another out; those who do not know or trust themselves must be brought about, and one must show them that two honorable persons who are united can be stronger than a hundred scoundrels. But all this must take place in secret. Our small heap must not abandon one another and assist everyone who is oppressed, provide every good man temporal advantages, outward happiness, and attempt to win all positions where power can be won for the good cause. Why should it not be permissible to establish oneself by righteous and gentle means to influence governments? The first objective of every state constitution is to place good persons at the helm, reward merit, and crown virtue. If the Order can attain this through advocacy and by guiding the heart, if it has educated the most faithful, best, wisest, most thoroughly tests persons for the state, if it tries to promote them and reward their diligence, it consequently fulfills the duties of the most faithful subjects and thus also fulfills the original purpose of human beings entering into social bonds.", ">>23872002\nNow imagine memorizing all of this.\n\n>>23872005\n\nIf, then, one has such a circle of in every nation, if every one of these forms a pair, if they cling to one another tightly, the Order can accomplish anything, and in this manner, it has already accomplished much for the good of humankind.

Additionally, a separate ESTHER HATE PAGE with false information about my suspension and reasons behind the creation of the Facebook event page was created on another internet website an hour ago by an outsider and went viral within minutes.

I'm posting the link because its the most horrific evidence of cyber bullying that I've ever personally experienced or seen, and because its underscores a much larger issue.
